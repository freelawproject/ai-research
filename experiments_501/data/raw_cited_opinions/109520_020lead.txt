<p id="AHQq">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b473-5">In the 1972 Amendments to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress, acting under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, authorized federal courts to award money damages in favor of a private individual against a state government found to have subjected that person to employment discrimination on the basis of <page-number citation-index="1" label="448">*448</page-number>“race, color, religion, sex, or national origin/'<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The principal question presented by these cases is whether, as against the shield of sovereign immunity afforded the State by the Eleventh Amendment, <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>415 U. S. 651 (1974), Congress has the power to authorize federal courts to enter such an award against the State as a means of enforcing the substantive guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the effect of our decision in <em>Edelman </em>was to foreclose Congress’ power. We granted certiorari to resolve this important constitutional question. 423 IT. S. 1031 (1975). We reverse.</p>
<p id="b474-5">I</p>
<p id="b474-6">Petitioners in No. 75-251 sued in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on behalf of all present and retired male employees of the State of Connecticut. Their amended complaint asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that certain provisions in the State’s statutory retirement benefit plan discriminated against them because of their sex, and therefore contravened Title VII of the 1964 Act, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(1970 ed. and Supp. IV). Title VII, which originally did not include state and local govern-<page-number citation-index="1" label="449">*449</page-number>merits, had in the interim been amended to bring the States within its purview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b475-5">The District Court held that the Connecticut State Employees Retirement Act violated Title VII's prohibition against sex-based employment discrimination. 390 F. Supp. 278, 285-288 (1974).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It entered prospective injunctive relief in petitioners’ favor against respondent state officials.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioners also sought an award of retroactive retirement benefits as compensation for losses <page-number citation-index="1" label="450">*450</page-number>caused by the State's discrimination,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as well as “a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.” <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the District Court held that both would constitute recovery of money damages from the State’s treasury, and were therefore precluded by the Eleventh Amendment and by this Court’s decision in <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra.</em></p>
<p id="b476-5">On petitioners’ appeal,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part. It agreed with the District Court that the action, “insofar as it seeks damages, is in essence against the state and as such is subject to the Eleventh Amendment.” 519 P. 2d 559, 565 (1975). The Court of Appeals also found that under the 1972 Amendments to Title VII, “Congress intended to authorize a private suit for backpay by state employees against the state.” <em>Id., </em>at 568. Notwithstanding this statutory authority, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court and held that under <em>Edelman </em>a “private federal action for retroactive damages” is not a “constitu<page-number citation-index="1" label="451">*451</page-number>tionally permissible method of enforcing Fourteenth Amendment rights.” 519 F. 2d, at 569. It reversed the District Court and remanded as to attorneys’ fees, however, reasoning that such an award would have only an “ancillary effect” on the state treasury of the kind permitted under <em>Edelman, supra, </em>at 667-668. 519 F. 2d, at 571. The petition filed here by the state employees in No. 75-251 contends that Congress does possess the constitutional power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to authorize their Title VII damages action against the State. The state officials’ cross-petition, No. 75-283, argues that under <em>Edelman </em>the Eleventh Amendment bars any award of attorneys’ fees here because it would be paid out of the state treasury.</p>
<p id="b477-5">II</p>
<p id="b477-6">In <em>Edelman </em>this Court held that monetary relief awarded by the District Court to welfare plaintiffs, by reason of wrongful denial of benefits which had occurred previous to the entry of the District Court’s determination of their wrongfulness, violated the Eleventh Amendment. Such an award was found to be indistinguishable from a monetary award against the State itself which had been prohibited in <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Treasury, </em>323 U. S. 459, 464 (1945). It was therefore controlled by that ease rather than by <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U. S. 123 (1908), which permitted suits against state officials to obtain prospective relief against violations of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="b477-7"><em>Edelman </em>went on to hold that the plaintiffs in that case could not avail themselves of the doctrine of waiver expounded in cases such as <em>Parden </em>v. <em>Terminal R. Co., </em>377 U. S. 184 (1964), and <em>Employees </em>v. <em>Missouri Public Health Dept., </em>411 U. S. 279 (1973), because the necessary predicate for that doctrine was congres<page-number citation-index="1" label="452">*452</page-number>sional intent to abrogate the immunity conferred by the Eleventh Amendment. We concluded that none of the statutes relied upon by plaintiffs in <em>Edelman </em>contained any authorization by Congress to join a State as defendant. The Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U. S. C. § 1983, had been held in <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, </em>365 U. S. 167, 187-191 (1961), to exclude cities and other municipal corporations from its ambit; that being the case, it could not have been intended to include States as parties defendant. The provisions of the Social Security Act relied upon by plaintiffs were held by their terms not to “authorize suit against anyone,” 415 U. S., at 674, and they, too, were incapable of supplying the predicate for a claim of waiver on the part of the State.</p>
<p id="b478-5">All parties in the instant litigation agree with the Court of Appeals that the suit for retroactive benefits by the petitioners is in fact indistinguishable from that sought to be maintained in <em>Edelman, </em>since what is sought here is a damages award payable to a private party from the state treasury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b478-6">Our analysis begins where <em>Edelman </em>ended, for in this Title VII case the “threshold fact of congressional authorization,” <em>id., </em>at 672, to sue the State as employer is clearly present. This is, of course, the prerequisite found present in <em>Farden </em>and wanting in <em>Employees. </em>We are aware of the factual differences between the type of state activity involved in <em>Farden </em>and that involved in the present case, but we do not think that difference is material for our purposes. The congressional authorization involved in <em>Parden </em>was based on the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause; here, however, the <page-number citation-index="1" label="453">*453</page-number>Eleventh Amendment defense is asserted in the context of legislation passed pursuant to Congress’ authority under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b479-5">As ratified by the States after the Civil War, that Amendment quite clearly contemplates limitations on their authority. In relevant part, it provides:</p>
<blockquote id="b479-6">“Section 1. . . . No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b479-7">“Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.”</blockquote>
<p id="b479-8">The substantive provisions are by express terms directed at the States. Impressed upon them by those provisions are duties with respect to their treatment of private individuals. Standing behind the imperatives is Congress’ power to “enforce” them “by appropriate legislation.”</p>
<p id="b479-9">The impact of the Fourteenth Amendment upon the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, and the reach of congressional power under § 5, were examined at length by this Court in <em>Ex 'parte Virginia, </em>100 U. S. 339 (1880). A state judge had been arrested and indicted under a federal criminal statute <page-number citation-index="1" label="454">*454</page-number>prohibiting the exclusion on the basis of race of any citizen from, service as a juror in a state court. The judge claimed that the statute was beyond Congress’ power to enact under either the Thirteenth<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court first observed that these Amendments “were intended to be, what they really are, limitations of the power of the States and enlargements of the power of Congress.” <em>Id., </em>at 345. It then addressed the relationship between the language of § 5 and the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment:</p>
<blockquote id="b480-5">“The prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment are directed to the States, and they are to a degree restrictions of State power. It is these which Congress is empowered to enforce, and to enforce against State action, however put forth, whether that action be executive, legislative, or judicial. Such enforcement is no invasion of State sovereignty. No law can be, which the people of the States have, by the Constitution of the United States, empowered Congress to enact. ... It is said the selection of jurors for her courts and the administration of her laws belong to each State; that they are her rights. This is true in the general. But in exercising her rights, a State cannot disregard the limitations which the Federal Constitution has applied to her power. Her rights do not reach to that extent. Nor can she deny to the general government the right to exercise all its <page-number citation-index="1" label="455">*455</page-number>granted powers, though they may interfere with the full enjoyment of rights she would have if those powers had not been thus granted. Indeed, every addition of power to the general government involves a corresponding diminution of the governmental powers of the States. It is carved out of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b481-5">“The argument in support of the petition for a <em>habeas corpus </em>ignores entirely the power conferred upon Congress by the Fourteenth Amendment. Were it not for the fifth section of that amendment, there might be room for argument that the first section is only declaratory of the moral duty of the State .... But the Constitution now expressly gives authority for congressional interference and compulsion in the cases embraced within the Fourteenth Amendment. It is but a limited authority, true, extending only to a single class of cases; but within its limits it is complete." <em>Id., </em>at 346-348.</blockquote>
<p id="b481-6"><em>Ex parte Virginia’s </em>early recognition of this shift in the federal-state balance has been carried forward by more recent decisions of this Court. See, <em>e: g., South Carolina </em>v. <em>Katsenbach, </em>383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966); <em>Mitchum </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>407 U. S. 225, 238-239 (1972).</p>
<p id="b481-7">There can be no doubt that this line of cases has sanctioned intrusions by Congress, acting under the Civil War Amendments, into the judicial, executive, and legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the States. The legislation considered in each case was grounded on the expansion of Congress’ powers— with the corresponding diminution of state sovereignty— found to be intended by the Framers and made part of the Constitution upon the States’ ratification of those <page-number citation-index="1" label="456">*456</page-number>Amendments, a phenomenon aptly described as a “carv[ing] out” in <em>Ex parte Virginia, supra, </em>at 346.</p>
<p id="b482-5">It is true that none of these previous cases presented the question of the relationship between- the Eleventh Amendment and the enforcement power granted to Congress under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. But we think that the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies, see <em>Hans </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>134 U. S. 1 (1890), are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. In that section Congress is expressly granted authority to enforce “by appropriate legislation” the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, which themselves embody significant limitations on state authority. When Congress acts pursuant to § 5, not only is it exercising legislative authority that is plenary within the terms of the constitutional grant, it is exercising that authority under one section of a constitutional Amendment whose other sections by their own terms embody limitations on state authority. We think that Congress may, in determining what is “appropriate legislation” for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, provide for private suits against States or state officials which are constitutionally impermissible in other contexts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>415 U. S. 651 (1974); <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Treasury, </em>323 U. S. 459 (1945).</p>
<p id="b482-6">Ill</p>
<p id="b482-7">In No. 75-283, the state officials contest the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that an award of attorneys’ fees in <page-number citation-index="1" label="457">*457</page-number>this case would under <em>Edelman </em>have only an “ancillary effect” on the state treasury and could therefore be permitted as falling outside the Eleventh Amendment under the doctrine of <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U. S. 123 (1908). 415 U. S., at 667-668. We need not address this question, since, given the express congressional authority for such an award in a case brought under Title VII,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it follows necessarily from our holding in No. 75-251 that Congress’ exercise of power in this respect is also not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals’ judgment in No. 75-283 on this basis.</p>
