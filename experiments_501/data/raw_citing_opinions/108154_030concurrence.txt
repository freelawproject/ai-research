<p id="b311-7">When <em>Sinclair Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106432"><a href="/opinion/106432/sinclair-refining-co-v-atkinson/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson">370 U. S. 195</a></span>, was decided in 1962, I subscribed to the opinion of the Court. Before six years had passed I had reached the conclusion that the <em>Sinclair </em>holding should be reconsidered, and said so in <em>Avco Corp. </em>v. <em>Aero Lodge 735, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107655"><a href="/opinion/107655/avco-corp-v-aero-lodge-no-735-international-assn-of-machinists/#562" aria-description="Citation for case: Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, International Ass&#x27;n of...">390 U. S. 557, 562</a></span> (concurring opinion). Today I join the Court in concluding “that <em>Sinclair </em>was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity.”</p>
<p id="b311-8">In these circumstances the temptation is strong to embark upon a lengthy personal <em>apologia. </em>But since Mr. Justice Brennan has so clearly stated my present views in his opinion for the Court today, I simply join in that opinion and in the Court’s judgment. An aphorism of Mr. Justice Frankfurter provides me refuge: “Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.” <em>Henslee </em>v. <em>Union Planters Bank, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104614"><a href="/opinion/104614/henslee-v-union-planters-national-bank-trust-co/#600" aria-description="Citation for case: Henslee v.
