 ... In fact it is quite possible that the grand jury would have been unwilling or unable to return an indictment based solely on Miller’s exaggeration of the amount of his claimed loss even though it had concluded that an indictment could be returned based on the overall scheme involving a use of the mail caused by Miller’s knowing consent to the burglary.” 715 F. 2d, at 1362-1363 .  B Miller’s indictment properly alleged violations of 18 U. S. C. § 1341 , and it fully and clearly set forth a number of ways in which the acts alleged constituted violations.  The facts proved at trial clearly conformed to one of the theories of the offense contained within that indictment, for the indictment gave Miller clear notice that he would have to defend against an allegation that he “‘well knew that the amount of copper claimed to have been taken during the alleged burglary was grossly inflated for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining $150,000 from Aetna Insurance Company.’” 715 F. 2d, at 1361 -1362 (quoting indictment).  Competent defense counsel certainly should have been on notice that that offense was charged and would need to be defended against.  Accordingly, there can be no showing here that Miller was prejudicially surprised at trial by the absence of proof concerning his alleged complicity in the burglary; *135 nor can there be a showing that the variance prejudiced the fairness of respondent’s trial in any other way.  Cf. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946).  See also Berger v. United States, <citedDecision>295 U. S. 78, 83</citedDecision> (1935).  Cf. also United States v. Ballard, 322 U. S. 78, 91 (1944) (Stone, C. J., dissenting).  The indictment was also sufficient to allow Miller to plead it in the future as a bar to subsequent prosecutions.  Therefore, none of these “notice” related concerns— which of course are among the important concerns underlying the requirement that criminal charges be set out in an indictment — would support the result of the Court of Appeals.  See Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749, 763-764 (1962).  The Court of Appeals did not disagree, but instead argued that Miller had been prejudiced in his right to be free from a trial for any offense other than that alleged in the grand jury’s indictment.  728 F. 2d, at 1270 .

 Relying on the Fifth Amendment’s grand jury guarantee, the Court of Appeals concluded that a conviction could not stand where the trial proof corresponded to a fraudulent scheme much narrower than, though included within, the scheme that the grand jury had alleged.  The Court of Appeals cited two prior decisions of this Court that emphasized the right of an accused to be tried only on charges that had in fact been passed on by a grand jury; Ibid, (citing Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212 (1960), and Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1 (1887)).  Cf. United States v. Mastelotto, 717 F. 2d 1238, 1248-1250 (CA91983) (similarly relying on Stirone and Bain).  II The Government correctly argues that the Court of Appeals’ result conflicts with a number of this Court’s prior *136 decisions interpreting the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause.. The Court has long recognized that an indictment may charge numerous offenses or the commission of any one offense in several ways.  As long as the crime and the elements of the offense that sustain the conviction are fully and clearly set out in the indictment, the right to a grand jury is not normally violated by the fact that the indictment alleges more crimes or other means of committing the same crime.  See, e. g., Ford v. United States, 273 U. S. 593 (1927); Salinger v. United States, 272 U. S. 542 (1926).  See also <citedDecision>Berger</citedDecision> v. United States, supra; Hall v. United States, 168 U. S. 632, 638-640 (1898).  Indeed, a number of longstanding doctrines of criminal procedure are premised on the notion that each offense whose elements are fully set out in an indictment can independently sustain a conviction.  See, e. g., Turner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398, 420 (1970) (“[W]hen a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, .  .  .  the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged”); Crain v. United States, 162 U. S. 625, 634-636 (1896) (indictment count that alleges in the conjunctive a number of means of committing a crime can support a conviction if any of the alleged means are proved); Dealy v. United States, 152 U. S. 539, 542 (1894) (prosecution’s failure to prosecute certain counts of an indictment does not affect the validity of the indictment as to the other counts).  A review of prior cases allowing convictions to stand in the face of variances between the indictment and proof makes the Court of Appeals’ error clear.

 .  .  comprehended several relatively distinct plans for fleecing intended victims.” Id., at 548.  Because the evidence only sustained the charge as to one of the plans, the trial judge withdrew from the jury those portions of the indictment that related to all other plans.  Salinger argued then, just as Miller argues now, that the variance between the broad allegations in the indictment and the narrower proof at trial violated his right to have had a grand jury screen any alleged offenses upon which he might be convicted at trial. This Court unanimously rejected Salinger’s argument on the ground that the offense proved was fully contained within the indictment.  Nothing had been added to the indictment which, in the Court’s view, “remained just as it was returned by the grand jury.” Ibid. “[T]he trial was on the charge preferred in it and not on a modified charge,” ibid., and there *138 was thus “not even remotely an infraction of the constitutional provision that ‘no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury.’” Id., at 549.  See also Berger v. United States, <citedDecision>295 U. S. 78</citedDecision> (1935); Goto v. Lane, 265 U. S. 393 (1924); Hall v. United States, supra, at 638-640.  5 The result reached by the Court of Appeals thus conflicts with the results reached by this Court in such cases as Salinger and Ford.  See also Hall v. United States, supra, at 638-640; Crain v. United States, supra, at 634-636.  I — I HH HH The Court of Appeals principally relied on this Court s decision in Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212 (1960), to support its conclusion that the Fifth Amendment’s grand jury right is violated by a conviction for a criminal plan narrower than, but fully included within, the plan set forth in the indictment.  Stirone , however, stands for a very different proposition.  In Stirone the offense proved at trial was not fully contained in the indictment, for trial evidence had “amended” the indictment by broadening the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment.  Stirone was thus wholly unlike the cases discussed in Part II, supra, and unlike respondent’s case, all of which involve trial evidence that narrowed the indictment’s charges without adding any new offenses.

 But in fact, neither that other company nor L. K. Comstock had sold San Francisco Scrap Metals the copper claimed to have been purchased.  Miller sent his proof of loss through the United States mail and received $100,000.  Aetna sent one $50,000 check to Miller through the mail.  Id., at 1361 .  4 Title 18 U. S. C. § 1341 reads as follows: “Whoever, having devised or intended to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or to sell, dispose of, loan, exchange, alter, give away, distribute, supply, or furnish or procure for unlawful use any counterfeit or spurious coin, obligation, security, or other article, or anything represented to be or intimated or held out to be such counterfeit or spurious article, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or takes or receives therefrom any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon, or at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.” 5 As is discussed supra, at 134-135, Miller has shown no prejudice to his ability to defend himself at trial, to the general fairness of the trial, or to the indictment’s sufficiency to bar subsequent prosecutions, and the Court of Appeals did not rest on any such theories of prejudice.  Cf. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946) (finding prejudice in a case of extreme variance between a charge of a very broad conspiracy and proof of far narrower but technically included conspiracies).  See also <citedDecision>Berger</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>295 U. S., at 83</citedDecision> .  6 This analysis is apparent in Sam’s discussion of the issue: “The learned judge who presided ... at the time the change was made in this indictment.  .  .  rests the validity of the court’s action in permitting the change in the indictment, upon the ground that the words stricken out were surplusage, and were not at all material to it, and that no injury was done to the prisoner by allowing such change to be made.  He goes on to argue that the grand jury would have found the indictment without this language.  But it is not for the court to say whether they would or not.
