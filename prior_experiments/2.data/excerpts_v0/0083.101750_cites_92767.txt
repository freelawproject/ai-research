Passage 1:
the supply mains, it necessarily is relieved of nearly all the pressure put upon it at the stations of the producing *471 companies, its volume thereby is expanded to many times what it was while in the high pressure interstate transmission lines, and it is divided into the many thousand relatively tiny streams that enter the small service lines connecting such mains with the pipes on the consumers' premises. So segregated the gas in such service lines and pipes remains in readiness or moves forward to serve as needed. The treatment and division of the large compressed volume of gas is like the breaking of an original package, after shipment in interstate commerce, in order that its contents may be treated, prepared for sale and sold at retail. State v. Flannelly, 96 Kan. 372, 383-384; 152 P. 22; W. Va. & Md. Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 134 Md. 137, 143-145; 106 A. 265. Cf. Atlantic Coast Line v. Standard Oil Co., 275 U.S. 257, 269. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419. Leisy v. Hardin, <targetCase>135 U.S. 100</targetCase>. It follows that the furnishing of gas to consumers in Ohio municipalities by means of distribution plants to supply the gas suitably for the service for which it is intended is not interstate commerce but a business of purely local concern exclusively within the jurisdiction of the State.
Appellant relies on Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., 252 U.S. 23. There the question was whether the New York commission had jurisdiction to prescribe the rates to be charged local consumers of gas transported to that State from Pennsylvania. This court, following the findings of the highest court of New York (225 N.Y. 397, 403-404; 122 N.E. 260), held that the entire movement of the gas was interstate commerce and that, in the absence of contrary regulation by the Congress, the state commission had jurisdiction to prescribe such rates. The theory on which that conclusion was reached is not wholly consistent with the views expressed in Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, supra, and in Mis
