 Parrish v. West Coast Hotel Co., 185 Wash. 581 ; 55 P. (2d) 1083 .  The case is here on appeal.  The appellant relies upon the decision of this Court in Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, 261 U. S. 525 , which held invalid the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Act, which was attacked under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.  On the argument at bar, counsel for the appellees attempted to distinguish the Adkins case upon the ground that the appellee was employed in a hotel and that the business of an innkeeper was affected with a public interest.  That effort at distinction is obviously futile, as it appears that in one of the cases ruled by the Adkins opinion the employee was a woman employed as an elevator operator in a hotel.  Adkins v. Lyons, 261 U. S. 525, at p. 542 .  The recent case of Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, <citedDecision>298 U. S. 587</citedDecision> , came here on certiorari to the New York court, which had held the New York minimum wage act for women to be invalid.  A minority of this Court thought that the New York statute was distinguishable in a material feature from that involved in the Adkins case, and that for that and other reasons the New *389 York statute should be sustained.  But the Court of Appeals of New York had said that it found no material difference between the two statutes, and this Court held that the “meaning of the statute” as fixed by the decision of the state court “must be accepted here as if the meaning had been specifically expressed in the enactment.” Id., p. 609.  That view led to the affirmance by this Court of the judgment in the <citedDecision>Morehead</citedDecision> case, as the Court considered that the only question before it was whether the Adkins case was distinguishable and that reconsideration of that decision had not been sought.  Upon that point the Court said: “The petition for the writ sought review upon the ground that this case [Morehead] is distinguishable from that one [Adkins].  No application has been made for reconsideration of the constitutional question there decided.  The validity of the principles upon which that decision rests is not challenged.  This court confines itself to the ground upon which the writ was asked or granted .  .  .  Here the review granted was no broader than that sought by the petitioner .  .  .  He is not entitled and does not aák to be heard upon the question whether the Adkins case should be overruled.  He maintains that it may be distinguished on the ground that the statutes are vitally dissimilar.” Id., pp. 604, 605.  We think that the question which was not deemed to be open in the <citedDecision>Morehead</citedDecision> case is open and is necessarily presented here.  The Supreme Court of Washington has upheld the minimum wage statute of that State.  It has decided that the statute is a reasonable exercise of the police power of the State.  In reaching that conclusion the state court has invoked principles long established by this Court in the application of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The state court has refused to regard the decision in the Adkins case as determinative and has pointed to our decisions both before and since that case as justifying its position.  We are of the opinion that this ruling of *390 the state court demands on our part a reexamination of the Adkins case. The importance of the question, in which many States having .similar laws are concerned, the close division by which the decision in the Adkins case was reached, and the economic conditions which have supervened, and in the light of which the reasonableness of the exercise of the protective power of the State must be considered, make it not only appropriate, but we think imperative, that in deciding the present case the subject should receive fresh consideration.  The history of the litigation of this question may be briefly stated.

 The judgment of the Court of Appeals holding the Act invalid was affirmed, but with Chief Justice Taft, Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Sanford dissenting, and Mr. Justice Brandéis taking no part.  The dissenting opinions took the ground that the decision was at variance with the *391 principles which this Court had frequently announced and applied.  In 1925 and 1927, the similar minimum wage statutes of Arizona and Arkansas were held invalid upon the authority of the Adkins case. The Justices who had!  dissented in that case bowed to the ruling and Mr. Justice Brandeis dissented.  Murphy v. Sardell, 269 U. S. 530 ; Donham v. West-Nelson Co., 273 U. S. 657 .  The question did not come before us again until the last .  term in the <citedDecision>Morehead</citedDecision> case, as already noted.  In that case, briefs supporting the New York statute were submitted by the States of Ohio, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Rhode Island.  298 U. S., p. 604, note.  Throughout this entire period the Washington statute now under consideration has been in force.  The principle which must control our decision is not in doubt.  The constitutional provision invoked is the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment governing the States, as the due process clause invoked in the Adkins case governed Congress.  In each case the violation alleged by those attacking minimum wage regulation for women is deprivation of freedom of contract.

 261 U. S., p. 564.  That challenge persists and is without any satisfactory answer.  As Chief Justice Taft observed: “In absolute freedom of contract the one term is as important as the other, for both enter equally into the consideration given and received, a restriction as to *396 the one is not greater in essence than the other and is of the same kind.  One is the multiplier and the other the multiplicand.” And Mr. Justice Holmes, while recognizing that “the distinctions of the law are distinctions of degree,” could “perceive no difference in the kind or degree of interference with liberty, the only matter with which we have any concern, between the one case and the other.  The bargain is equally affected whichever half you regulate.” Id., p. 569.  One of the points which was pressed by the Court in supporting its ruling in the Adkins case was that the standard set up by the District of Columbia Act did not take appropriate account of the value of the services rendered.  In the <citedDecision>Morehead</citedDecision> case, the minority thought that the New York statute had met that point in its definition of a “fair wage” and that it accordingly presented a distinguishable feature which the Court could recognize within the limits which the <citedDecision>Morehead</citedDecision> petition for certiorari was deemed to present.  The Court, however, did not take that view and the New York Act was held to be essentially the same as that for the District of Columbia.  The statute now before us is like the latter, but we are unable to conclude that in its minimum wage requirement the State has passed beyond the boundary of its broad protective power.  The minimum wage to be paid under the Washington statute is fixed after full consideration by representatives of employers, employees and the public.  It may be assumed that the minimum wage is fixed in consideration of the services that are performed in the particular occupations under normal conditions.  Provision is made for special licenses at less wages in the case of women who are incapable of full service.  The statement of Mr. Justice Holmes in the Adkins case is pertinent: “This statute does not compel anybody to pay anything.

 This familiar principle has repeatedly been applied to legislation which singles out women, and particular classes of women, in the exercise of the State’s protective power.  Miller v. Wilson, supra, p. 384 ; Bosley v. McLaughlin, supra, pp. 394, 395 ; Radice v. New York, supra, pp. 295-298.  Their relative need in the presence of the evil, no less than the existence of the evil itself, is a matter for the legislative judgment.  Our conclusion is that the case of Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, supra, should be, and it is, overruled.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington is Affirmed.  Mr. Justice Sutherland, dissenting: Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. Justice McReynolds, Mr. Justice Butler and I think the judgment of the court below should be reversed.  *401 The principles and authorities relied upon to sustain the judgment, were considered in Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, 261 U. S. 525 , and Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, <citedDecision>298 U. S. 587</citedDecision> ; and their lack of application to cases like the one in hand was pointed out.  A sufficient answer to all that is now said will be found in the opinions of the court in those cases. Nevertheless, in the circumstances, it seems well to restate our reasons and conclusions.  Under our form of government, where the written Constitution, by its own terms, is the supreme law, some agency, of necessity, must have the power to say the final word as to the validity of a statute assailed as unconstitutional.  The Constitution makes it clear that the power has been intrusted to this court when the question arises in a controversy within its jurisdiction; and so long as the power remains there, its exercise cannot be avoided without betrayal of the trust.  It has been pointed out many times, as in the Adkins case, that this judicial duty is one of gravity and delicacy; and that rational doubts must be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of the statute.  But whose doubts, and by whom resolved?  Undoubtedly it is the duty of a member of the court, in the process of reaching a right conclusion, to give due weight to the opposing views of his associates; but in the end, the question which he must answer is not whether such views seem sound to those who entertain them, but whether they convince him that the statute is constitutional or engender in his mind a rational doubt upon that issue.

 They are not now before us; and it is enough that it applies in every particular to the Washington statute now under consideration.  The Washington statute, like the one for the District of Columbia, fixes minimum wages for adult women.  Adult men and their employers are left free to bargain as they please; and it is a significant and an important fact that all state statutes to which our attention has been called are of like character.  The common-law rules restricting the power of women to make contracts have, under our system, long since practically disappeared.  Women today stand upon a legal and political equality with men.  There is no longer any reason why they should be put in different classes in respect of their legal *412 right to make contracts; nor should they be denied, in effect, the right to compete with men for work paying lower wages which men may be willing to accept.  And it is an arbitrary exercise of the legislative power to do so. In the Tipaldo case, <citedDecision>298 U. S. 587, 615</citedDecision> , it appeared that the New York legislature had passed two minimum-wage measures — one dealing with women alone, the other with both men and women.  The act which included men was vetoed by the governor.  The other, applying to women alone, was approved.  The “factual background” in respect of both measures was substantially the same.  In pointing out the arbitrary discrimination which resulted (pp. 615-617) we said: “These legislative declarations, in form of findings or recitals of fact, serve well to illustrate why any measure that deprives employers and adult women of freedom to agree upon wages, leaving employers and men employees free so to do, is necessarily arbitrary.  Much, if not all, that in them is said in justification of the regulations that the Act imposes in respect of women’s wages applies with equal force in support of the same regulation of men’s wages.  While men are left free to fix their wages by agreement with employers, it would be fanciful to suppose that the regulation of women’s wages would be useful to prevent or lessen the evils listed in the first section of the Act.
