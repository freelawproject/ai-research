**Dissenting Opinion**
 See Act of May 6, 1910, 36 Stat. 348 ; Act of March 3, 1921, 41 Stat. 1225 , 1249; Act of May 27, 1924, 43 Stat. 176 ; Act of May 29, 1924, 43 Stat. 244 ; Act of April 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 68 .  There are various other expressions of Congressional understanding on this point.  For example, H. Rep. No. 2415, 71st Cong., 3d Sess., p. 1, advocating passage of what is now the Act of February 14, 1931, 46 Stat. 1108 , declares: “Under existing law the restricted allotted lands of Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes are tax exempt while restricted.” See also S. Rep. No. 982, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 3, 4, 5; S. Rep. No. 330, 65th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 4.  The Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312 , by specifically providing in § 4 that lands from which “restrictions have been or shall be removed shall be subject to taxation,” strongly indicates a Congressional understanding that restriction amounted to tax exemption.  For example, among the statutes applicable to the Creeks and Seminóles, see §§ 3 and 4 of the Act of May 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 495 and 733.  See generally the statutes collected in Note 11, supra. Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567 ; Act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861 ; Act of June 30,1902, 32 Stat. 500 ; § 19 of Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; § 4 of the Act of May 10,1928, 45 Stat. 495 and 733.  See Sen. Doc. 169, 58th Cong., 2d Sess. It is for this historical reason that cases such as Superintendent v. Commissioner, <citedDecision>295 U. S. 418</citedDecision> , and Landman v. Commissioner, 123 F. 2d 787 , have no bearing upon a consideration of the effect of restrictions upon the power of a state to tax. See Act of July 1,1898, 30 Stat. 567 ; Act of March 1,1901, 31 Stat. 861 ; Act of June 30,1902, 32 Stat. 500 .  Act of April 26,1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; Act of May 10,1928, 45 Stat. 495 .  Since 1908 the regulations prescribed by the Secretary under § 2 of the Act of 1908, 35 Stat. 312 and related statutes governing oil, gas and other mining leases of restricted lands, have recognized that proceeds from such leases are restricted and have required that all such money be paid to a representative of the Secretary.  See 25 C. F. R. §§ 183.18 , 183.20; see also § 20 of the regulations approved April 20, 1908.  In Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U. S. 575 , the interest of an oil lessee in land purchased for an Indian by the Secretary of the Interior with the Indian’s restricted funds and conveyed to the Indian by a restricted form of deed pursuant to conditions imposed by the Secretary, was held subject to an Oklahoma oil production tax. The opinion emphasized the difference between “a mere conveyancer’s restriction” and action by Congress.  Two of the decedents died before the Act was passed.  The House Committee report, however, makes it clear that the restriction on funds was intended to be declaratory and retroactive.
