 The latter was designed “to indicate what the original cost of the property would have been if 1938 material and labor prices had prevailed throughout the whole period of the piecemeal construction of the company’s property since 1898.” 44 P. IT.  R. (N. S.), pp. 8-9.  Hope estimated by the “per cent condition” method accrued depreciation at about 35% of *597 reproduction cost new.  On that basis Hope contended for a rate base of $66,000,000.  The Commission refused to place any reliance on reproduction cost new, saying that it was “not predicated upon facts” and was “too conjectural and illusory to be given any weight in these proceedings.” Id., p. 8.  It likewise refused to give any “probative value” to trended “original cost” since it was “not founded in fact” but was “basically erroneous” and produced “irrational results.” Id., p. 9.  In determining the amount of accrued depletion and depreciation the Commission, following Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 292 U. S. 151, 167-169 ; Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., <citedDecision>315 U. S. 575, 592-593</citedDecision> , based its computation on “actual legitimate cost.” It found that Hope during the years when its business was not under regulation did not observe “sound depreciation and depletion practices” but “actually accumulated an excessive reserve” 4 of about $46,000,000.  Id., p. 18.  One member of the Commission thought that the entire amount of the reserve should be deducted from “actual legitimate cost” in determining the rate base.  5 The majority of the *598 Commission concluded, however, that where, as here, a business is brought under regulation for the first time and where incorrect depreciation and depletion practices have prevailed, the deduction of the reserve requirement (actual existing depreciation and depletion) rather than the excessive reserve should be made so as to lay “a sound basis for future regulation and control of rates.” Id., p. 18.  As we have pointed out, it determined accrued depletion and depreciation to be $22,328,016; and it allowed approximately $1,460,000 as the annual operating expense for depletion and depreciation.  6 Hope’s estimate of original cost was about $69,735,-000 — approximately $17,000,000 more than the amount found by the Commission.  The item of $17,000,000 was made up largely of expenditures which prior to December 31, 1938, were charged to operating expenses.

 Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 134 .  The fixing of prices, like other applications of the police power, may reduce the value of the property which is being regulated.  But the fact that the value is reduced does not mean that the regulation is invalid.  Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135, 155-157 ; Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502 , 523-539 and cases cited.  It does, however, indicate that “fair value” is the end product of the process of rate-making not the starting point as the Circuit Court of Appeals held.  The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to depend upon “fair value” when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated.  9 *602 We held in <citedDecision>Federal Power Commission</citedDecision> v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., supra, that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of for-mulae in determining rates.  Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of “pragmatic adjustments.” Id., p. 586.  And when the Commission’s order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order “viewed in its entirety” meets the requirements of the Act.  Id., p. 686.  Under the statutory standard of “just and reasonable” it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling.  Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 289 U. S. 287, 304-305, 314 ; West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 1), 294 U. S. 63, 70 ; West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 295 U. S. 662, 692-693 (dissenting opinion).  It is not theory but the impact of the rate order which counts.

 Reversed.  Mr. Justice Roberts took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. Opinion of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Murphy: We agree with the Court’s opinion and would add nothing to what has been said but for what is patently a wholly gratuitous assertion as to Constitutional law in the dissent of Mr. Justice Frankfurter.  We refer to the statement that “Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, supra, may fairly be claimed.” That was the case in which a majority of this Court was finally induced to expand the meaning *620 of “due process” so as to give courts power to block efforts of the state and national governments to regulate economic affairs.  The present case does not afford a proper occasion to discuss the soundness of that doctrine because, as stated in Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s dissent, “that issue is not here in controversy.” The salutary practice whereby courts do not discuss issues in the abstract applies with peculiar force to Constitutional questions.  Since, however, the dissent adverts to a highly controversial due process doctrine and implies its acceptance by Congress, we feel compelled to say that we do not understand that Congress voluntarily has acquiesced in a Constitutional principle of government that courts, rather than legislative bodies, possess final authority over regulation of economic affairs.  Even this Court has not always fully embraced that principle, and we wish to repeat that we have never acquiesced in it, and do not now.  See Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., <citedDecision>315 U. S. 575, 599-601</citedDecision> .  Hope produces about one-third of its annual gas requirements and purchases the rest under some 300 contracts.  These five companies are the East Ohio Gas Co., the Peoples Natural Gas Co., the River Gas Co., the Fayette County Gas Co., and the Manufacturers Light & Heat Co. The first three of these companies are, like Hope, subsidiaries of Standard Oil Co. (N. J.).  East Ohio and River distribute gas in Ohio, the other three in Pennsylvania.  Hope’s approximate sales in m. c. f. for 1940 may be classified as follows: Local West Virginia sales.  11,000,000 East Ohio.  40,000,000 Peoples.

 If we assume that the reduction in company revenues is warranted we then come to the question of translating the allowed return into rates for consumers or classes of consumers.  Here the Commission fixed a single rate for all gas delivered irrespective of its use despite the fact that Hope has established what amounts to two rates — a high one for domestic use and a lower one for industrial contracts.  46 The Commission can fix two prices for interstate gas as readily as one — a price for resale to domestic users and another for resale to industrial users.  This is the pattern Hope itself has established in the very contracts over which the Commission is expressly given jurisdiction.  Certainly the Act is broad enough to permit two prices to be fixed instead of one, if the concept of the “public interest” is not unduly narrowed.  The Commission’s concept of the public interest in natural gas cases which is carried today into the Court’s opinion was first announced in the opinion of the minority in the Pipeline case. It enumerated only two “phases of the public interest: (1) the investor interest; (2) the consumer interest,” which it emphasized to the exclusion of all others.  <citedDecision>315 U. S. 575, 606</citedDecision> .  This will do well enough in dealing with railroads or utilities supplying manufactured gas, electric power, a communications service or transportation, where utilization of facilities does not impair their future usefulness.  Limitation of supply, however, brings into a natural gas case another phase of the public interest that to my mind overrides both the owner *657 and the consumer of that interest.  Both producers and industrial consumers have served their immediate private interests at the expense of the long-range public interest.  The public interest, of course, requires stopping unjust enrichment of the owner.  But it also requires stopping unjust impoverishment of future generations.  The public interest in the use by Hope’s half million domestic consumers is quite a different one from the public interest in use by a baker’s dozen of industries.

 Whether the Commission will assert its apparently broad statutory authorization over prices and discrimina-tions is, of course, its own affair, not ours. It is entitled to its own notion of the “public interest” and its judgment of policy must prevail.  However, where there is ground for thinking that views of this Court may have constrained the Commission to accept the rate-base method of decision and a particular single formula as “all important” for a rate base, it is appropriate to make clear the reasons why I, at least, would not be so understood.  The Commission is free to face up realistically to the nature and peculiarity of the resources in its control, to foster their duration in fixing price, and to consider future interests in addition to those of investors and present consumers.  If we return this case it may accept or decline the proffered freedom.  This problem presents the Commission an unprecedented opportunity if it will boldly make sound economic considerations, instead of legal and accounting theories, the foundation of federal policy.  I would return the case to the Commission and thereby be.clearly quit of what now may appear to be some responsibility for perpetrating a short-sighted pattern of natural gas regulation.  <citedDecision>315 U.S. 575</citedDecision> .  Judge Dobie, dissenting below, pointed out that the majority opinion in the Pipeline case “contains no express discussion of the Prudent Investment Theory” and that the concurring opinion contained a clear one, and said, “It is difficult for me to believe that the majority of the Supreme Court, believing otherwise, would leave such a statement unchallenged.” The fact that two other Justices had as matter of record in our books long opposed the reproduction cost theory of rate bases and had commented favorably on the pru *629 dent investment theory may have influenced that conclusion.  See opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Driscoll v. Edison Light & Power Co., 307 U. S. 104, 122 , and my brief as Solicitor General in that case. It should be noted, however, that these statements were made, not in a natural gas case, but in an electric power case — a very important distinction, as I shall try to make plain.  Natural gas from the Appalachian field averages about 1,050 to 1,150 B. T. U. content, while by-product manufactured gas is about 530 to 540.
