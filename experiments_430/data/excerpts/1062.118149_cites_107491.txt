**Combined Opinion**
 By 1940, the Court broadly declared all business combinations “formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce” illegal per se. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 223 (1940).  Accordingly, the Court condemned an agreement between two affiliated liquor distillers to limit the maximum price charged by retailers in Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211 (1951), noting that agreements to fix maximum prices, “no less than those to fix minimum prices, cripple the freedom of traders and thereby restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment.” Id., at 213 .  In subsequent cases, the Court’s attention turned to arrangements through which suppliers imposed restrictions on dealers with respect to matters other than resale price.  In White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U. S. 253 (1963), the Court considered the validity of a manufacturer’s assignment of exclusive territories to its distributors and dealers.  The Court determined that too little was known about the competitive impact of such vertical limitations to warrant treating them as per se unlawful.  Id., at 263 .  Four years later, in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., <citedDecision>388 U. S. 365</citedDecision> (1967), the Court reconsidered the status of exclusive dealer territories and held that, upon the transfer of title to goods to a distributor, a supplier’s imposition of territorial restrictions on the distributor was “so obviously destructive of competition” as to constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 379</citedDecision> .  In Schwinn, the Court acknowledged that some vertical restrictions, such as the conferral of territorial rights or franchises, could have procompetitive benefits by allowing smaller enterprises to compete, and that *12 such restrictions might avert vertical integration in the distribution process.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 379-380</citedDecision> .  The Court drew the line, however, at permitting manufacturers to control product marketing once dominion over the goods had passed to dealers.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 380</citedDecision> .  Albrecht , decided the following Term, involved a newspaper publisher who had granted exclusive territories to independent carriers subject to their adherence to a maximum price on resale of the newspapers to the public.  Influenced by its decisions in Socony-Vacuum, Kiefer-Stewart, and Schwinn, the Court concluded that it was per se unlawful for the publisher to fix the maximum resale price of its newspapers.  390 U. S., at 152-154 .  The Court acknowledged that “[mjaximum and minimum price fixing may have different consequences in many situations,” but nonetheless condemned maximum price fixing for “substituting the perhaps erroneous judgment of a seller for the forces of the competitive market.” Id., at 152 .  Albrecht was animated in part by the fear that vertical maximum price fixing could allow suppliers to discriminate against certain dealers, restrict the services that dealers could afford to offer customers, or disguise minimum price fixing schemes.  Id., at 152-153 .
**Combined Opinion**
 Accordingly, this Court has reconsidered its decisions construing the Sherman Act when the theoretical underpinnings of those decisions are called into serious question.  See, e. g., Copperweld Corp., supra, at 777; GTE Sylvania, supra, at 47-49; cf. Tigner v. Texas, 310 U. S. 141, 147 (1940).  Although we do not “lightly assume that the economic realities underlying earlier decisions have changed, or that earlier judicial perceptions of those realities were in error,” we have noted that “different sorts of agreements” may amount to restraints of trade “in varying times and circumstances,” and “[i]t would make no sense to create out of the single term ‘restraint of trade’ a chronologically schizoid statute, in which a ‘rule of reason’ evolves with new circumstances and new wisdom, but a line of per se illegality remains forever fixed where it was.” Business Electronics, supra, at 731-732.  Just as Schwinn was “the subject of continuing controversy and confusion” under the “great weight” of scholarly criticism, GTE Sylvania, supra, at 47-48, Albrecht has been widely criticized since its inception.  With the views underlying Albrecht eroded by this Court’s precedent, there is not much of that decision to salvage.  See, e. g., Neal v. United States, 516 U. S. 284, 295 (1996); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 480-481 (1989).  Although the rule of Albrecht has been in effect for some time, the inquiry we must undertake requires considering “ ‘the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional *22 restraints in the American economy today.’” GTE Sylvania, supra, at 53, n. 21 (quoting Schwinn, <citedDecision>388 U. S., at 392</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  As the Court noted in ARCO, 495 U. S., at 336, n. 6 , there has not been another ease since Albrecht in which this Court has “confronted an unadulterated vertical, maximum-price-fixing arrangement.” Now that we confront Albrecht directly, we find its conceptual foundations gravely weakened.  In overruling Albrecht , we of course do not hold that all vertical maximum price fixing is per se lawful.  Instead, vertical maximum priee fixing, like the majority of commercial arrangements subject-to the antitrust laws, should be evaluated under the rule of reason.  In our view, rule-of-reason analysis will effectively identify those situations in which vertical maximum price fixing amounts to anticompetitive conduct.  There remains the question whether respondents are entitled to recover damages based on State Oil’s conduct.  Although the Court of Appeals noted that “the district judge was right to conclude that if the rule of reason is applicable, Khan loses,” 93 F. 3d, at 1362 , its consideration of this case was necessarily premised on Albrecht's per se rule.
