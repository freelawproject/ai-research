 476 U. S. 1181 (1986).  We now affirm.  The Constitution grants to Congress the power “[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.” U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 14.  Exercising this authority, Congress has empowered courts-martial to try servicemen for the crimes proscribed by the U. C. M. J., *439 Arts. 2, 17, 10 U. S. C. §§ 802 , 817.  The Alaska offenses with which petitioner was charged are each described in the U. C. M. J. See n. 1, supra. Thus it is not disputed that the court-martial convened in New York possessed the statutory authority to try petitioner on the Alaska child abuse specifications.  In an unbroken line of decisions from 1866 to 1960, this Court interpreted the Constitution as conditioning the proper exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over an offense on one factor: the military status of the accused.  Gosa v. Mayden, 413 U. S. 665, 673 (1973) (plurality opinion); see Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234, 240-241, 243 (1960); Reid v. Covert, <citedDecision>354 U.

Anderson, 255 U. S. 1, 6-9 (1921); Givens v. Zerbst, 255 U. S. 11, 20-21 (1921).  This view was premised on what the Court described as the “natural meaning” of Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, as well as the Fifth Amendment’s exception for “cases arising in the land or naval forces.” <citedDecision>Reid</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Covert, supra, at 19</citedDecision> ; United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, supra, at 15 .  As explained in Kinsella v.

**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment. Today’s unnecessary overruling of precedent is most unwise. The opinion of the United States Court of Military Appeals demonstrates that petitioner’s offenses were sufficiently “service connected” to confer jurisdiction on the military tribunal. Unless this Court disagrees with that determination — and I would be most surprised to be told that it does —it has no business reaching out to reexamine the decisions in O’Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258 (1969), and Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, 401 U. S. 355 (1971). While there might be some dispute about the exact standard to be applied in deciding whether to overrule prior decisions, I had thought that we all could agree that such drastic action is only appropriate when essential to *452 the disposition of a case or controversy before the Court. * The fact that any five Members of the Court have the power to reconsider settled precedents at random, does not make that practice legitimate. For the reasons stated by the Court of Military Appeals, I agree that its judgment should be affirmed. Even in its brief proposing the reconsideration of O’Callahan , the United States asked the Court to reconsider that decision only in the event that the Court disagrees with the United States’ submission that petitioner’s acts of sexual assaults on military dependents are service related. Brief for United States 28.

 See Duke & Vogel, The Constitution and the Standing Army: Another Problem of Court-Martial Jurisdiction, 12 Vand. L. Rev. 435 , 452-453 (1960).  Common-law felonies in peacetime were only brought within the court-martial jurisdiction in 1916.  Wiener, Courts-Martial and the Bill of Rights: The Original Practice I, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 1 , 10-12 (1958).  The Framers’ conception of what could properly be tried in a court-martial must have informed their understanding of what cases arise in the Armed Forces, thus permitting what would otherwise be unconstitutional infringements of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.  The relatively recent expansion of the authority of military tribunals appears to disregard the Framers’ understanding.  Instead of acknowledging the Fifth Amendment limits on the crimes triable in a court-martial, the Court simply ignores them.  But “[t]he concept that the Bill of Rights and other constitutional protections against arbitrary government are inoperative when they become inconvenient or when expediency dictates otherwise is a very dangerous doctrine and if allowed to flourish would destroy the benefit of a written Constitution and undermine the basis of our Government.” Reid v. Covert, <citedDecision>354 U. S. 1, 14</citedDecision> (1957) (plurality opin *462 ion).  The limitations may not, in the view of the majority, be desirable, but that does not mean they do not exist.  The requirement of service connection recognized in O’Callahan has a legitimate basis in constitutional language and a solid historical foundation.  It should be applied in this case. II Application of the service connection requirement of O’Callahan , as further elaborated in Relford, v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, 401 U. S. 355 (1971), demonstrates that petitioner’s Alaska crimes do not have an adequate service connection to support the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction.  Petitioner’s offenses did not detract from the performance of his military duties.  He committed these crimes while properly absent from his unit, and there was no connection between his assigned duties and his crimes.  Nor did petitioner’s crimes threaten people or areas under military control.

 Whether petitioner would have these rights in any prosecution by a dual sovereign is not at issue here, however.  The sole question is whether the Federal Government, when it proceeded against petitioner, was obliged to provide those safeguards guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  See Grafton v. United States, 206 U. S. 333, 352-354 (1907).  The language of this exception could be understood to mean that “cases arising in the land or naval forces,” as well as in the militia, are only excepted from the requirement of grand jury indictment or presentment “in actual service in time of War or public danger.” This Court, however, has interpreted the “time of war” provision as referring only to cases arising in the militia, not the land or naval forces.  Johnson v. Sayre, 158 U. S. 109, 114 (1895).  I am not convinced this reading of the Fifth Amendment is correct, but need not rely on a different interpretation here.  “This Court has constantly reiterated that the language of the Constitution where clear and unambiguous must be given its plain evident meaning.” Reid v. Covert, <citedDecision>354 U. S. 1, 8, n. 7</citedDecision> (1957) (plurality opinion).  See also Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, 401 U. S. 355, 362-363 (1971); Gosa v. Mayden, 413 U. S. 665, 672-673 (1973).  The majority contends that, before O’Callahan , this Court had held consistently that status as a member of the Armed Forces was an adequate basis for the assertion of court-martial jurisdiction.  Ante, at 439.  But a number of the precedents cited dealt with the assertion of court-martial jurisdiction over individuals who were not members of the Armed Forces and therefore, this Court ruled, did not come within the reach of Art. I, § 8, el.  14.  See Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234, 246-248 (1960) (military dependent in noncapital case); <citedDecision>Reid</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Covert, supra, at 19-23</citedDecision> (plurality opinion) (military dependent in capital case); United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 14-15 (1955) (discharged veteran); see also Grisham v. Hagan, 361 U. S. 278 (1960) (civilian military employee in capital case); McElroy v. United States ex rel. Guagliardo, 361 U. S. 281, 286 (1960) (civilian military employee in noncapital case).  Having disposed of these cases on the threshold issue of the reach of the congressional power created by Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, the Court did not consider the limits imposed on the Article I power by the Fifth Amendment.  Several of the remaining cases cited involved crimes committed in the course of the performance of military duties that therefore clearly arose in the Armed Forces.  See Grafton v. United States, supra (murder by Army private serving sentry duty on post); Johnson v. Sayre, supra (embezzlement of United States funds intended for the Naval service); Smith v. Whitney, 116 U. S. 167 (1886) (fraud on Navy contracts).  In Smith , the Court concluded that “such conduct of a naval officer is a case arising in the naval forces, and therefore punishable by court martial under the articles and regulations made or approved by Congress in the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, to provide and maintain a navy, and to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces, without indictment or trial by jury.” Id., at 186 .  The remaining cases cited by the majority are similarly inapposite.  Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509 (1879), dealt with a murder committed by a soldier in time of war.
