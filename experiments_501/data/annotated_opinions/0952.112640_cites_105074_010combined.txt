 There is no evidence other than O'Brien that the Virginia Supreme Court has ever conducted such a review, and O'Brien explicitly declined to announce such a *744 practice.  We decline Coleman's invitation to announce such a practice for that court. Finally, Coleman argues that the Virginia Supreme Court's dismissal order in this case is at least ambiguous because it was issued "[u]pon consideration" of all the filed papers, including Coleman's petition for appeal and the Commonwealth's brief in opposition, both of which discussed the merits of Coleman's federal claims.  There is no doubt that the Virginia Supreme Court's "consideration" of all filed papers adds some ambiguity, but we simply cannot read it as overriding the court's explicit grant of a dismissal motion based solely on procedural grounds.  Those grounds are independent of federal law. Coleman contends also that the procedural bar was not adequate to support the judgment.  Coleman did not petition for certiorari on this question, and we therefore accept the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the bar was adequate.  See 895 F. 2d, at 143 .  IV In Daniels v. Allen , the companion case to Brown v. Allen, <citedDecision>344 U. S. 443</citedDecision> (1953), we confronted a situation nearly identical to that here.  Petitioners were convicted in a North Carolina trial court and then were one day late in filing their appeal as of right in the North Carolina Supreme Court. That court rejected the appeals as procedurally barred.  We held that federal habeas was also barred unless petitioners could prove that they were "detained without opportunity to appeal because of lack of counsel, incapacity, or some interference by officials." <citedDecision>Id., at 485-486</citedDecision> .  Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963), overruled this holding.  Noia failed to appeal at all in state court his state conviction, and then sought federal habeas review of his claim that his confession had been coerced.  This Court held that such a procedural default in state court does not bar federal habeas review unless the petitioner has deliberately bypassed state procedures by intentionally forgoing an opportunity for state *745 review.  Id., at 438-439 .  Fay thus created a presumption in favor of federal habeas review of claims procedurally defaulted in state court. The Court based this holding on its conclusion that a State's interest in orderly procedure is sufficiently vindicated by the prisoner's forfeiture of his state remedies.  "Whatever residuum of state interest there may be under such circumstances is manifestly insufficient in the face of the federal policy .

Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 548 (1985).  Federal habeas review of state-court judgments, respectfully employed to safeguard federal rights, is no invasion of state sovereignty.  Cf. Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S., at 346 .  Since 1867, Congress has acted within its constitutional authority to "`interpose the federal courts between the States and the people, as guardians of the people's federal rights to protect the people from unconstitutional action.'" Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 10 (1984), quoting Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225, 242 (1972).  See 28 U. S. C. § 2254 .  Justice Frankfurter, in his separate opinion in Brown v. Allen, <citedDecision>344 U. S. 443, 510</citedDecision> (1953), recognized this: "Insofar as [federal habeas] jurisdiction enables federal district courts to entertain claims that State Supreme Courts have denied rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution, it is not a case of a lower court sitting in judgment on a higher court. It is merely one aspect of respecting the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution whereby federal law is higher than State law." Thus, the considered exercise by federal courts  in vindication of fundamental constitutional rightsof the habeas jurisdiction conferred on them by Congress exemplifies the full expression of this Nation's federalism.  *761 That the majority has lost sight of the animating principles of federalism is well illustrated by its discussion of the duty of a federal court to determine whether a state-court judgment rests on an adequate and independent state ground.  According to the majority's formulation, establishing this duty in the federal court serves to diminish the risk that a federal habeas court will review the federal claims of a prisoner in custody pursuant to a judgment that rests upon an adequate and independent state ground.  In reality, however, this duty of a federal court to determine its jurisdiction originally was articulated to ensure that federal rights were not improperly denied a federal forum.  Thus, the quote artfully reconstituted by the majority, ante, at 736, originally read: "[I]t is incumbent upon this Court, when it is urged that the decision of the state court rests upon a non-federal ground, to ascertain for itself, in order that constitutional guarantees may appropriately be enforced, whether the asserted non-federal ground independently and adequately supports the judgment." Abie State Bank v. Bryan, 282 U. S. 765, 773 (1931) (emphasis added).  Similarly, the Court has stated that the duty "cannot be disregarded without neglecting or renouncing a jurisdiction conferred by the law and designed to protect and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof."

 In its attempt to justify a blind abdication of responsibility by the federal courts, the majority's opinion marks the nadir of the Court's recent habeas jurisprudence, where the discourse of rights is routinely replaced with the functional dialect of interests.  The Court's habeas jurisprudence now routinely, and without evident reflection, subordinates fundamental constitutional rights to *765 mere utilitarian interests.  See, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991).  Such unreflective cost-benefit analysis is inconsistent with the very idea of rights.  See generally Cover & Aleinikoff, Dialectical Federalism: Habeas Corpus and the Court, 86 Yale L. J. 1035, 1092 (1977).  The Bill of Rights is not, after all, a collection of technical interests, and "surely it is an abuse to deal too casually and too lightly with rights guaranteed" therein.  <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. Allen, <citedDecision>344 U. S., at 498</citedDecision> (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  It is well settled that the existence of a state procedural default does not divest a federal court of jurisdiction on collateral review.  See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 82-84 (1977).  Rather, the important office of the federal courts in vindicating federal rights gives way to the States' enforcement of their procedural rules to protect the States' interest in being an equal partner in safeguarding federal rights.  This accommodation furthers the values underlying federalism in two ways.  First, encouraging a defendant to assert his federal rights in the appropriate state forum makes it possible for transgressions to be arrested sooner and before they influence an erroneous deprivation of liberty.  Second, thorough examination of a prisoner's federal claims in state court permits more effective review of those claims in federal court, honing the accuracy of the writ as an implement to eradicate unlawful detention.  See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 519 (1982); <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. Allen, <citedDecision>344 U. S., at 500-501</citedDecision> (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  The majority iguores these purposes in concluding that a State need not bear the burden of making clear its intent to rely on such a rule.  When it is uncertain whether a state-court judgment denying relief from federal claims rests on a procedural bar, it is inconsistent with federalism principles for a federal court to exercise discretion to decline to review those federal claims.  In justifying its new rule, the majority first announces that, as a practical matter, the application of the Long presumption to a summary order entered in a case where a state *766 prisoner presented federal constitutional claims to a state court is unwarranted, because "it is simply not true that the `most reasonable explanation' is that the state judgment rested on federal grounds." Ante, at 737, quoting Long, 463 U. S., at 1041 .  The majority provides no support for this fiat assertion.  In fact, the assertion finds no support in reality.  "Under our federal system, the federal and state `courts [are] equally bound to guard and protect the rights secured by the Constitution.'" Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S., at 518 , quoting Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 251 (1886).  Accordingly, state prisoners are required to present their federal claims to state tribunals before proceeding to federal habeas, "to protect the state courts' role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state judicial proceedings." 455 U. S., at 518.  See 28 U. S. C. § 2254 .  Respect for the States' responsible assumption of this solemn trust compels the conclusion that state courts presented with federal constitutional claims actually resolve those claims unless they indicate to the contrary.  Cf. <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. Allen, <citedDecision>344 U. S., at 512</citedDecision> (opinion of Frankfurter, J.) ("[The availability of the writ of habeas corpus] does not mean that prison doors may readily be opened.  It does mean that explanation may be exacted why they should remain closed").  The majority claims that applying the plain-statement rule to summary orders "would place burdens on the States and state courts," ante, at 738, suggesting that these burdens are borne independently by the States and their courts.  The State, according to the majority, "pays the price" for federal review of state prisoner claims "in terms of the uncertainty and delay" as well as in the cost of a retrial.  Id., at 738-739.  The majority is less clear about the precise contours of the burden this rule is said to place on state courts, merely asserting that it "would also put too great a burden on the state courts." Ante, at 739.
