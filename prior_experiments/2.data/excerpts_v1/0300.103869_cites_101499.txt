See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U.S. 286 , 309, 31 S.Ct. 578 , 583, 55 L.Ed. 738 ; Ex parte Webb, 225 U.S. 663 , 682, 683, 32 S.Ct. 769 , 775, 776, 56 L.Ed. 1248 ; Ward v. Love County, 253 U.S. 17 , 40 S.Ct. 419 , 64 L.Ed. 751 ; Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U.S. 363 , 366, 50 S.Ct. 121 , 122, 74 L.Ed. 478 . 34 As we recently said in Board of Commissioners v. Seber, supra, Congress in 1887 turned from a policy of protecting Indian tribes in the possession of their domains to a program, now discontinued, of assimilating the Indians through dissolution of their tribal governments and the compulsory individualization of their lands. This allotment program evolved out of the historical background sketched above, and took its cue from the previous protection and freedom from state control accorded Indians and their lands. The Indian surrendered tribal land, protected against state taxation as well as against all other forms of voluntary and involuntary encumbrance and alienation. Cf. The Kansas Indians, supra; The New York Indians, supra.

500 ; ยง 19 of Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; ยง 4 of Act of May 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 495 and Act May 24, 1928, 45 Stat. 733 . The fact that the exemptions do not mention inheritance or estate taxes is unimportant. As pointed out before, contrary to the general rule Indian tax exemptions are to be liberally construed. See Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U.S. 363 , 366, 367, 50 S.Ct. 121 , 122, 74 L.Ed. 478 . For that reason decisions, such as United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U.S. 57 , 59 S.Ct. 692 , 83 L.Ed. 1104 , that statutory exemptions from taxation do not include an exemption from estate taxes, have no application here. 3 In addition to the statutes cited in Note 2, supra, see also Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312 ; and Act of January 27, 1933, 47 Stat.
