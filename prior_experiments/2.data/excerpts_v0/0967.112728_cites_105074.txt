Passage 1:
risdiction of trial court). But once they have been surmountedonce the claim is properly before the district *15 courta habeas petitioner, like any civil litigant, has had a right to a hearing where one is necessary to prove the facts supporting his claim. See, e. g., Hawk v. Olson, 326 U.S. 271, 278-279 (1945); Holiday v. Johnston, 313 U.S. 342, 351-354 (1941); Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275, 285-287 (1941); Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S. 86, 92 (1923). Thus when we observed in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S., at 312, that "the opportunity for redress . . . presupposes the opportunity to be heard, to argue and present evidence," we were saying nothing new. We were merely restating what had long been our understanding of the method by which contested factual issues raised on habeas should be resolved.
Habeas corpus has always differed from ordinary civil litigation, however, in one important respect: The doctrine of res judicata has never been thought to apply. See, e. g., Brown v. Allen, <targetCase>344 U.S. 443</targetCase>, 458 (1953); Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 214 (1950); Waley v. Johnston, 316 U.S. 101, 105 (1942); Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U.S. 224, 230 (1924). A state prisoner is not precluded from raising a federal claim on habeas that has already been rejected by the state courts. This is not to say that state court factfinding is entitled to no weight, or that every state prisoner has the opportunity to relitigate facts found against him by the state courts. Concerns of federalism and comity have pushed us from this extreme just as the importance of the writ has repelled us from the opposite extreme, represented by the strict application of res judicata. Instead, we have consistently occupied the middle ground. Even before Townsend, federal courts deferred to state court findings of fact where the federal district judge was satisfied that the state court had fairly considered the issues and the evidence and had reached a satisfactory result. See, e. g., Brown, supra, at 458, 465; Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 332-336 (1915). But where such was not the case, the federal court entertaining the habeas petition would examine the facts a new. See, e. g., Ex parte Hawk, 321 U.S. 114, 116, 118 (1944); Moore, supra, *16 at 92. In Hawk, for example, we stated that a state prisoner would be entitled to a hearing, 321 U.S., at 116, "where resort to state court remedies has failed to afford a full and fair adjudication of the federal contentions raised . . . because in the particular case the remedy afforded by state law proves in practice unavailable or seriously inadequate." Id.,  at 118. In Brown, we explained that a hearing may be dispensed with only "[w]here the record of the application affords an adequate opportunity to weigh the sufficiency of the allegations and the evidence, and no unusual circumstances calling for a hearing are <targetCase>presented." 344 U.S., at 463</targetCase>.
Townsend "did not launch the Court in any new directions," Weisselberg, Evidentiary Hearings in Federal Habeas Corpus Cases, 1990 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 131, 150, but it clarified how the district court should measure the adequacy of the state court proceeding. Townsend specified six circumstances in which one could not be confident that "the statecourt trier of fact has after a full hearing reliably found the relevant facts." 372 U.S., at 313. The Court held that a habeas petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his factual allegations if
"(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole; (3) the fact-finding procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing; (4) there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence; (5) the material facts were not adequately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6) for any reason
Passage 2:
U.S. 293 (1963), insofar as relevant to this case, merely reflected existing law. The claim thus seems to be that the general rule stated by the Court in Townsend governing when an evidentiary hearing must be granted to a federal habeas corpus petitioner, as well as each of the Court's six criteria particularizing its general pronouncement, reflected what was to be found in prior holdings of the Court. This is a very doubtful claim. Surely the Court at that time did not think this was the case, for it pointedly observed that prior cases had not settled all aspects of the hearing problem in habeas proceedings and that the lower federal courts had reached widely divergent and irreconcilable results in dealing with hearing issues. Id., at 310, and n. 8. Hence it deemed it advisable to give further guidance to the lower courts. It also expressly stated that the rules it was announcing "must be considered to supersede, to the extent of any inconsistencies, the opinions in Brown v. Allen [, <targetCase>344 U.S. 443 </targetCase>(1953)]." Id., at 312. This was necessary because Brown was inconsistent with the holding of Townsend regarding habeas petitioners who failed to adequately develop federal claims in state-court proceedings. See Brown v. Allen, <targetCase>344 U.S. 443</targetCase>, 465 (1953) (federal court may deny writ without rehearing of facts "where the legality of [the] detention has been determined, on the facts presented, " by the state court) (emphasis added); id., at 463 (writ should be refused, without more, if federal court satisfied from the record that "state process has given fair consideration to the issues and the offered evidence") (emphasis added). We have unequivocally acknowledged that Townsend substantially changed the availability of evidentiary hearings in federal habeas proceedings. See Smith v. Yeager, 393 U.S. 122, 125 (1968) (per curiam).

It is not surprising, then, that none of the cases cited by Justice O'Connor remotely support Townsend `s requirement for a hearing in any case where the "material facts were not adequately developed at the statecourt hearing" due to petitioner's own neglect. 372 U.S., at 313. Finally, it is undeniable that Fay v. Noia `s deliberate bypass standard overruled prior procedural default cases, and it i
Passage 3:
the deliberate bypass standard borrowed by Townsend from a decision that has since been repudiated.
We agree with Justice O'Connor that under our holding a claim invoking the fifth circumstance of Townsend will be unavailing where the cause asserted is attorney error. Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478 (1986), and Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991), dictate as much. Such was the intended effect of those cases, but this does not make that circumstance a dead letter, for cause may be shown for reasons other than attorney error. We noted in Murray, a procedural default case, that objective factors external to the defense may impede counsel's efforts to comply and went on to say: "Without attempting an exhaustive catalog of such objective impediments to compliance with a procedural rule, we note that a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel, see Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S., at 16, or that `some interference by officials,' Brown v. Allen, <targetCase>344 U.S. 443</targetCase>, 486 (1953), made compliance impracticable, would constitute cause under this standard." 477 U.S., at 488. Much of the same may be said of cases where the petitioner has defaulted on the development of a claim.
Nor, to the extent it is relevant to our decision in this case, is Justice O'Connor's argument that many forms of cause would fall under other Townsend circumstances persuasive. For example, the third and sixth circumstances of Townsend speak to the denial by a court of full and fair hearing; however, a situation where facts were inadequately developed because of interference from officials would fall naturally into the fifth circumstance.
