**Dissenting Opinion**
 See also Restatement, Judgments §68 (1).  The Court also suggests that the concurrent sentence doctrine should not be applied for the additional reason that the eventual length of petitioner’s burglary sentence is “still in some doubt.” See ante, at 793.  Petitioner received a 10-year sentence following his first burglary conviction and a 15-year sentence after his second conviction.  The latter sentence was subsequently vacated and resen-tencing ordered by a federal district court. See Benton v. Copinger, 291 F. Supp. 141 (1968).  The State has appealed.  Whatever the outcome of that appeal, I consider that the probability of petitioner’s burglary sentence being reduced below five years, so as to make the concurrent sentence doctrine inoperative, is manifestly negligible.  Cf., e. g., Sibron v. New York, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 40, 55-56</citedDecision> (1968).  See Supplementary Brief for Respondent 20, n. 6.  So far as I have been able to discover, there is no State in which petitioner’s larceny conviction could have habitual offender consequences.  See, e. g., Cichos v. Indiana, 385 U. S. 76 (1966); Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, 379 U. S. 306 (1964); Bell v. Maryland, 378 U. S. 226 (1964); Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740 (1961); Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, 349 U. S. 70 (1955).  See, e. g., United States v. Gainey, 380 U. S. 63 (1965); Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U. S. 109 (1959).  In the interest of strict accuracy, it should be pointed out that Mr. Justice Stewart cannot and does not fully join in the above sentence of this opinion.  He joined my dissenting opinion in Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, but wrote a separate memorandum in Mapp v. Ohio, supra, at 672 ; joined the opinion of Mr. Justice Clark in Ker v. California, supra; joined Mr. Justice White’s dissenting *809 opinion in Malloy v. Hogan, supra, at 33 ; wrote an opinion concurring in the result in Pointer v. Texas, supra, at 409 ; wrote a dissenting opinion in Griffin v. California, supra, at 617; and separately concurred in the result in Klopfer v. North Carolina, supra, at 226 .
