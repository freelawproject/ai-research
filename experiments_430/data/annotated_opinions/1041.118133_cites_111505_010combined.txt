**Combined Opinion**
 In the course of our opinion, we observed that New York had created the special school district in response to our decision in Aguilar , which had required New York to cease providing IDEA services to Satmar children on the premises of their private religious schools.  512 U. S., at 692 .  Five Justices joined opinions calling for reconsideration of Aguilar .  See 512 U. S., at 718 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 731 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 750 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Thomas, J., dissenting).  But the question of Aguilar `s propriety was not before us.  The views of five Justices that the case should be reconsidered or overruled cannot be said to have effected a change in Establishment Clause law. In light of these conclusions, petitioners' ability to satisfy the prerequisites of Rule 60(b)(5) hinges on whether our later Establishment Clause cases have so undermined *218 Aguilar that it is no longer good law. We now turn to that inquiry.  III A In order to evaluate whether Aguilar has been eroded by our subsequent Establishment Clause cases, it is necessary to understand the rationale upon which Aguilar , as well as its companion case, School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 373</citedDecision> (1985), rested.  In <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> , the Court evaluated two programs implemented by the School District of Grand Rapids, Michigan.  The district's Shared Time program, the one most analogous to Title I, provided remedial and "enrichment" classes, at public expense, to students attending nonpublic schools.  The classes were taught during regular school hours by publicly employed teachers, using materials purchased with public funds, on the premises of nonpublic schools.  The Shared Time courses were in subjects designed to supplement the "core curriculum" of the nonpublic schools.  <citedDecision>Id., at 375-376</citedDecision> .  Of the 41 nonpublic schools eligible for the program, 40 were "`pervasively sectarian' " in characterthat is, "`the purpos[e] of [those] schools [was] to advance their particular religions.' " <citedDecision>Id., at 379</citedDecision> .  The Court conducted its analysis by applying the threepart test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971): "First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion." 473 U. S., at 382-383 (quoting Lemon, supra, at 612-613 ) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court acknowledged that the Shared Time program served a purely secular purpose, thereby satisfying the first *219 part of the so-called Lemon test.  473 U. S., at 383.  Nevertheless, it ultimately concluded that the program had the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  Id., at 385.
**Combined Opinion**
 The Court separated its prior decisions evaluating programs that aided the secular activities of religious institutions into two categories: those in which it concluded that the aid resulted in an effect that was "indirect, remote, or incidental" (and upheld the aid); and those in which it concluded that the aid resulted in "a direct and substantial advancement of the sectarian enterprise" (and invalidated the aid).  Id., at 393 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In light of Meek and Wolman , Grand Rapids' program fell into the latter category.  In those cases, the Court ruled that a state loan of instructional equipment and materials to parochial schools was an impermissible form of "direct aid" because it "advanced the primary, religion-oriented educational function of the sectarian school," 473 U. S., at 395 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), by providing "inkind" *221 aid ( e. g., instructional materials) that could be used to teach religion and by freeing up money for religious indoctrination that the school would otherwise have devoted to secular education.  Given the holdings in Meek and Wolman , the Shared Time programwhich provided teachers as well as instructional equipment and materialswas surely invalid.  473 U. S., at 395.  The <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> Court likewise placed no weight on the fact that the program was provided to the student rather than to the school.  Nor was the impermissible effect mitigated by the fact that the program only supplemented the courses offered by the parochial schools.  <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 395 397.  The New York City Title I program challenged in Aguilar closely resembled the Shared Time program struck down in <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> , but the Court found fault with an aspect of the Title I program not present in <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> : The Board had "adopted a system for monitoring the religious content of publicly funded Title I classes in the religious schools." 473 U. S., at 409.  Even though this monitoring system might prevent the Title I program from being used to inculcate religion, the Court concluded, as it had in Lemon and Meek , that the level of monitoring necessary to be "certain" that the program had an exclusively secular effect would "inevitably resul[t] in the excessive entanglement of church and state," thereby running afoul of Lemon `s third prong.  473 U. S., at 409; see Lemon, 403 U. S., at 619 (invalidating Rhode Island program on entanglement grounds because "[a] comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that th[e] restrictions [against indoctrination] are obeyed"); Meek, supra, at 370 (invalidating Pennsylvania program on entanglement grounds because excessive monitoring would be required for the State to be certain that public school officials do not inculcate religion).  In the majority's view, New York City's Title I program suffered from the "same critical elements of entanglement" present in Lemon and Meek : the aid was provided "in a pervasively *222 sectarian environment .  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 .. to ensure the absence of a religious message." 473 U. S., at 412.  Such "pervasive monitoring by public authorities in the sectarian schools infringes precisely those Establishment Clause values at the root of the prohibition of excessive entanglement." Id., at 413.  The Court noted two further forms of entanglement inherent in New York City's Title I program: the "administrative cooperation" required to implement Title I services and the "dangers of political divisiveness" that might grow out of the day-to-day decisions public officials would have to make in order to provide Title I services.  Id., at 413-414.  Distilled to essentials, the Court's conclusion that the Shared Time program in <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> had the impermissible effect of advancing religion rested on three assumptions: (i) any public employee who works on the premises of a religious school is presumed to inculcate religion in her work; (ii) the presence of public employees on private school premises creates a symbolic union between church and state; and (iii) any and all public aid that directly aids the educational function of religious schools impermissibly finances religious indoctrination, even if the aid reaches such schools as a consequence of private decisionmaking.  Additionally, in Aguilar there was a fourth assumption: that New York City's Title I program necessitated an excessive government entanglement with religion because public employees who teach on the premises of religious schools must be closely monitored to ensure that they do not inculcate religion.  B Our more recent cases have undermined the assumptions upon which <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar relied.  To be sure, the general principles we use to evaluate whether government aid violates the Establishment Clause have not changed since Aguilar was decided.  For example, we continue to ask whether the government acted with the purpose of advancing *223 or inhibiting religion, and the nature of that inquiry has remained largely unchanged.  See Witters , 474 U. S., at 485 486; Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 602-604 (1988) (concluding that Adolescent Family Life Act had a secular purpose); Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 248-249 (1990) (concluding that Equal Access Act has a secular purpose); cf. Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578 (1987) (striking down Louisiana law that required creationism to be discussed with evolution in public schools because the law lacked a legitimate secular purpose).  Likewise, we continue to explore whether the aid has the "effect" of advancing or inhibiting religion.  What has changed since we decided <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar is our understanding of the criteria used to assess whether aid to religion has an impermissible effect.  1 As we have repeatedly recognized, government inculcation of religious beliefs has the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  Our cases subsequent to Aguilar have, however, modified in two significant respects the approach we use to assess indoctrination.  First, we have abandoned the presumption erected in Meek and <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion.  In Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993), we examined whether the IDEA, 20 U. S. C. § 1400 et seq., was constitutional as applied to a deaf student who sought to bring his state-employed signlanguage interpreter with him to his Roman Catholic high school.  We held that this was permissible, expressly disavowing the notion that "the Establishment Clause [laid] down [an] absolute bar to the placing of a public employee in a sectarian school." 509 U. S., at 13 .  "Such a flat rule, smacking of antiquated notions of `taint,' would indeed exalt *224 form over substance." Ibid. We refused to presume that a publicly employed interpreter would be pressured by the pervasively sectarian surroundings to inculcate religion by "add[ing] to [or] subtract[ing] from" the lectures translated.  Ibid. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assumed instead that the interpreter would dutifully discharge her responsibilities as a full-time public employee and comply with the ethical guidelines of her profession by accurately translating what was said.  Id., at 12 .  Because the only government aid in Zobrest was the interpreter, who was herself not inculcating any religious messages, no government indoctrination took place and we were able to conclude that "the provision of such assistance [was] not barred by the Establishment Clause." Id, at 13.  Zobrest therefore expressly rejected the notionrelied on in <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar  that, solely because of her presence on private school property, a public employee will be presumed to inculcate religion in the students.  Zobrest also implicitly repudiated another assumption on which <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar turned: that the presence of a public employee on private school property creates an impermissible "symbolic link" between government and religion.  Justice Souter contends that Zobrest did not undermine the "presumption of inculcation" erected in <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar , and that our conclusion to the contrary rests on a "mistaken reading" of Zobrest.  Post, at 248 (dissenting opinion).  In his view, Zobrest held that the Establishment Clause tolerates the presence of public employees in sectarian schools "only .  .  .  in .  .. limited circumstances" i.  e., when the employee "simply translates for one student the material presented to the class for the benefit of all students." Post, at 249.  The sign-language interpreter in Zobrest is unlike the remedial instructors in <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar because signing, Justice Souter explains, "[cannot] be understood as an opportunity to inject religious content in what [is] supposed to be secular instruction." Post, at 248-249.  He is thus able to conclude that Zobrest is distinguishable *225 fromand therefore perfectly consistent with <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar .  In Zobrest , however, we did not expressly or implicitly rely upon the basis Justice Souter now advances for distinguishing <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar .  If we had thought that signers had no "opportunity to inject religious content" into their translations, we would have had no reason to consult the record for evidence of inaccurate translations.  509 U. S., at 13 .  The signer in Zobrest had the same opportunity to inculcate religion in the performance of her duties as do Title I employees, and there is no genuine basis upon which to confine Zobrest `s underlying rationalethat public employees will not be presumed to inculcate religionto signlanguage interpreters.  Indeed, even the Zobrest dissenters acknowledged the shift Zobrest effected in our Establishment Clause law when they criticized the majority for "stray[ing] .  .  .  from the course set by nearly five decades of Establishment Clause jurisprudence." Id., at 24 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Thus, it was Zobrest and not this litigationthat created "fresh law." Post, at 249.  Our refusal to limit Zobrest to its facts despite its rationale does not, in our view, amount to a "misreading" of precedent.  Second, we have departed from the rule relied on in <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.  In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from issuing a vocational tuition grant to a blind person who wished to use the grant to attend a Christian college and become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.  Even though the grant recipient clearly would use the money to obtain religious education, we observed that the tuition grants were "`made available generally without regard to the sectariannonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.' " Id., at 487 (quoting Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 782-783 , *226 n. 38 (1973)).  The grants were disbursed directly to students, who then used the money to pay for tuition at the educational institution of their choice.  In our view, this transaction was no different from a State's issuing a paycheck to one of its employees, knowing that the employee would donate part or all of the check to a religious institution.  In both situations, any money that ultimately went to religious institutions did so "only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of" individuals.  474 U. S., at 487 .  The same logic applied in Zobrest , where we allowed the State to provide an interpreter, even though she would be a mouthpiece for religious instruction, because the IDEA's neutral eligibility criteria ensured that the interpreter's presence in a sectarian school was a "result of the private decision of individual parents" and "[could not] be attributed to state decisionmaking." 509 U. S., at 10 (emphasis added).  Because the private school would not have provided an interpreter on its own, we also concluded that the aid in Zobrest did not indirectly finance religious education by "reliev[ing] [the] sectarian schoo[l] of costs [it] otherwise would have borne in educating [its] students." Id., at 12 .  Zobrest and Witters make clear that, under current law, the Shared Time program in <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and New York City's Title I program in Aguilar will not, as a matter of law, be deemed to have the effect of advancing religion through indoctrination.  Indeed, each of the premises upon which we relied in <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> to reach a contrary conclusion is no longer valid.  First, there is no reason to presume that, simply because she enters a parochial school classroom, a full-time public employee such as a Title I teacher will depart from her assigned duties and instructions and embark on religious indoctrination, any more than there was a reason in Zobrest to think an interpreter would inculcate religion by altering her translation of classroom lectures.  Certainly, no evidence has ever shown that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students.  *227 National Coalition for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Harris, 489 F. Supp. 1248, 1262, 1267 (SDNY 1980); Felton v. Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed., 739 F. 2d, at 53, aff'd sub nom. Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985).  Thus, both our precedent and our experience require us to reject respondents' remarkable argument that we must presume Title I instructors to be "uncontrollable and sometimes very unprofessional." Tr. of Oral Arg. 39.  As discussed above, Zobrest also repudiates <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> `s assumption that the presence of Title I teachers in parochial school classrooms will, without more, create the impression of a "symbolic union" between church and state.  Justice Souter maintains that Zobrest is not dispositive on this point because Aguilar `s implicit conclusion that New York City's Title I program created a "symbolic union" rested on more than the presence of Title I employees on parochial school grounds.  Post, at 250.  To him, Title I continues to foster a "symbolic union" between the Board and sectarian schools because it mandates "the involvement of public teachers in the instruction provided within sectarian schools," ibid., and "fus[es] public and private faculties," post, at 254.  Justice Souter does not disavow the notion, uniformly adopted by lower courts, that Title I services may be provided to sectarian school students in off-campus locations, post, at 246-247, even though that notion necessarily presupposes that the danger of "symbolic union" evaporates once the services are provided off campus.  Taking this view, the only difference between a constitutional program and an unconstitutional one is the location of the classroom, since the degree of cooperation between Title I instructors and parochial school faculty is the same no matter where the services are provided.  We do not see any perceptible (let alone dispositive) difference in the degree of symbolic union between a student receiving remedial instruction in a classroom on his sectarian school's campus and one receiving instruction in a van parked just at the school's curbside.
**Combined Opinion**
 A number of our Establishment Clause cases have found that the criteria used for identifying beneficiaries are relevant in a second respect, apart from enabling a court to evaluate whether the program *231 subsidizes religion.  Specifically, the criteria might themselves have the effect of advancing religion by creating a financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination.  Cf. Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 (upholding neutrally available program because it did not "creat[e a] financial incentive for students to undertake sectarian education"); Zobrest, supra, at 10 (upholding neutrally available IDEA aid because it "creates no financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school"); accord, post, at 253 (Souter, J., dissenting) ("[E]venhandedness is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an aid program to satisfy constitutional scrutiny").  This incentive is not present, however, where the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Under such circumstances, the aid is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion.  See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 274 (1981) ("The provision of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect").  In <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar , the Court gave this consideration no weight.  Before and since those decisions, we have sustained programs that provided aid to all eligible children regardless of where they attended school.  See, e. g., Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 16-18 (1947) (sustaining local ordinance authorizing all parents to deduct from their state tax returns the costs of transporting their children to school on public buses); Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, 243-244 (1968) (sustaining New York law loaning secular textbooks to all children); Mueller v. Allen, supra, at 398-399 (sustaining Minnesota statute allowing all parents to deduct actual costs of tuition, textbooks, and transportation from state tax returns); Witters, supra, at 487-488 (sustaining Washington law granting all eligible blind persons vocational assistance); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (sustaining section of IDEA providing all "disabled" children with necessary aid).  *232 Applying this reasoning to New York City's Title I program, it is clear that Title I services are allocated on the basis of criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion.  34 CFR § 200.10 (b) (1996); see supra, at 209-210.  The services are available to all children who meet the Act's eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school, 20 U. S. C. § 6312 (c)(1)(F).  The Board's program does not, therefore, give aid recipients any incentive to modify their religious beliefs or practices in order to obtain those services.
**Combined Opinion**
 Moreover, we have not found excessive entanglement in cases in which States imposed far more onerous burdens on religious institutions than the monitoring system at issue here.  See Bowen, supra, at 615-617 .  To summarize, New York City's Title I program does not run afoul of any of three primary criteria we currently use to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: It does not result in governmental indoctrination; define its recipients by reference to religion; or create an excessive entanglement.  We therefore hold that a federally funded program providing supplemental, remedial instruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis is not invalid under the Establishment Clause when such instruction *235 is given on the premises of sectarian schools by government employees pursuant to a program containing safeguards such as those present here.  The same considerations that justify this holding require us to conclude that this carefully constrained program also cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.  Accord, Witters, 474 U. S., at 488-489 ("[T]he mere circumstance that [an aid recipient] has chosen to use neutrally available state aid to help pay for [a] religious education [does not] confer any message of state endorsement of religion"); Bowen, supra, at 613-614 (finding no "`symbolic link' " when Congress made federal funds neutrally available for adolescent counseling).  Accordingly, we must acknowledge that Aguilar , as well as the portion of <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> addressing Grand Rapids' Shared Time program, are no longer good law. C The doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude us from recognizing the change in our law and overruling Aguilar and those portions of <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> inconsistent with our more recent decisions.  As we have often noted, " [s]tare decisis is not an inexorable command," Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991), but instead reflects a policy judgment that "in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right," Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  That policy is at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution because our interpretation can be altered only by constitutional amendment or by overruling our prior decisions.  Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 63 (1996); Payne, supra, at 828 ; St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, 298 U. S. 38, 94 (1936) (Stone and Cardozo, JJ., concurring in result) ("The doctrine of stare decisis .  .  .  has only a limited application in the field of constitutional law").  Thus, we have held in several cases that stare decisis does not prevent us from overruling a previous decision where *236 there has been a significant change in, or subsequent development of, our constitutional law. United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995) ( stare decisis may yield where a prior decision's "underpinnings [have been] eroded, by subsequent decisions of this Court"); Alabama v. Smith, 490 U. S. 794, 803 (1989) (noting that a "later development of .  .  .  constitutional law" is a basis for overruling a decision); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 857 (1992) (observing that a decision is properly overruled where "development of constitutional law since the case was decided has implicitly or explicitly left [it] behind as a mere survivor of obsolete constitutional thinking").  As discussed above, our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has changed significantly since we decided <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar , so our decision to overturn those cases rests on far more than "a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of [1985]." Casey, supra, at 864 .  We therefore overrule <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar to the extent those decisions are inconsistent with our current understanding of the Establishment Clause.  Nor does the "law of the case" doctrine place any additional constraints on our ability to overturn Aguilar .  Under this doctrine, a court should not reopen issues decided in earlier stages of the same litigation.  Messenger v. Anderson, 225 U. S. 436, 444 (1912).  The doctrine does not apply if the court is "convinced that [its prior decision] is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice." Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605, 618, n. 8 (1983).  In light of our conclusion that Aguilar would be decided differently under our current Establishment Clause law, we think adherence to that decision would undoubtedly work a "manifest injustice," such that the law of the case doctrine does not apply.
**Combined Opinion**
 Indeed, under these circumstances, it would be particularly inequitable for us to bide our time waiting for another case to arise while the city of New York labors under a continuing injunction forcing it to spend millions of dollars on mobile instructional units and leased sites when it could instead be spending that money to give economically disadvantaged children a better chance at success in life by means of a program that is perfectly consistent with the Establishment Clause.  For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the cases to the District Court with instructions to vacate its September 26, 1985, order.  It is so ordered.  Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, and with whom Justice Breyer joins as to Part II, dissenting.  In this novel proceeding, petitioners seek relief from an injunction the District Court entered 12 years ago to implement our decision in Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985).  For the reasons given by Justice Ginsburg, see post, p. 255, the Court's holding that petitioners are entitled to relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) is seriously mistaken.  The Court's misapplication of the Rule is tied to its equally erroneous reading of our more recent Establishment Clause cases, which the Court describes as having rejected the underpinnings of Aguilar and portions of Aguilar `s companion case, School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 373</citedDecision> (1985).  The result is to repudiate the very reasonable line drawn in Aguilar and <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> , and to authorize direct state aid to religious institutions on an unparalleled *241 scale, in violation of the Establishment Clause's central prohibition against religious subsidies by the government.  I respectfully dissent.  I In both Aguilar and <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> , we held that supplemental instruction by public school teachers on the premises of religious schools during regular school hours violated the Establishment Clause.  Aguilar , of course, concerned the very school system before us here and the same Title I program at issue now, see ante, at 211-212, under which local educational agencies receive public funds to provide remedial education, guidance, and job counseling to eligible students, including those attending religious schools.  Immediately before Aguilar , New York City used Title I funds to provide guidance services and classes in remedial reading, remedial mathematics, and English as a second language to students at religious schools, as it did by sending employees of the public school system, including teachers, guidance counselors, psychologists, and social workers, into the religious schools.  See Aguilar, supra, at 406 .  <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> involved a program similar in many respects to Title I called Shared Time, [1] under which the local school district provided religious school students with "supplementary" classes in their religious schools, taught by teachers who were full-time employees of the public schools, in subjects including remedial math and reading, art, music, and physical education.  See 473 U. S., at 375.  We held that both schemes ran afoul of the Establishment Clause.  The Shared Time program had the impermissible effect of promoting religion in three ways: first, state-paid teachers conducting classes in a sectarian environment might *242 inadvertently (or intentionally) manifest sympathy with the sectarian aims to the point of using public funds for religious educational purposes, id., at 388; second, the government's provision of secular instruction in religious schools produced a symbolic union of church and state that tended to convey a message to students and to the public that the State supported religion, id. , at 390-392; and, finally, the Shared Time program subsidized the religious functions of the religious schools by assuming responsibility for teaching secular subjects the schools would otherwise be required to provide, id. , at 395-396.  Our decision in Aguilar noted the similarity between the Title I and Shared Time programs, and held that the system New York City had adopted to monitor the religious content of Title I classes held in religious schools would necessarily result in excessive entanglement of church and state, and violate the Establishment Clause for that reason.  See 473 U. S., at 412-414.  As I will indicate as I go along, I believe Aguilar was a correct and sensible decision, and my only reservation about its opinion is that the emphasis on the excessive entanglement produced by monitoring religious instructional content obscured those facts that independently called for the application of two central tenets of Establishment Clause jurisprudence.  The State is forbidden to subsidize religion directly and is just as surely forbidden to act in any way that could reasonably be viewed as religious endorsement.  See, e. g., Ball, <citedDecision>473 U. S., at 385</citedDecision> ("Although Establishment Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause does absolutely prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith"); <citedDecision>id.</citedDecision> , at 389 ("Government promotes religion as effectively when it fosters a close identification of its powers and responsibilities with those of any or allreligious denominations as when it attempts to inculcate specific religious doctrines") (citing Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 688 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring)).  *243 As is explained elsewhere, the flat ban on subsidization antedates the Bill of Rights and has been an unwavering rule in Establishment Clause cases, qualified only by the conclusion two Terms ago that state exactions from college students are not the sort of public revenues subject to the ban.  See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U. S. 819, 868-876 (1995) (Souter, J., dissenting); see also id. , at 850 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  The rule expresses the hard lesson learned over and over again in the American past and in the experiences of the countries from which we have come, that religions supported by governments are compromised just as surely as the religious freedom of dissenters is burdened when the government supports religion.  "When the government favors a particular religion or sect, the disadvantage to all others is obvious, but even the favored religion may fear being `taint[ed] .  .  .  with a corrosive secularism.' The favored religion may be compromised as political figures reshape the religion's beliefs for their own purposes; it may be reformed as government largesse brings government regulation." Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 608 (1992) (Blackmun, J., concurring) (quoting <citedDecision>Ball, supra, at 385</citedDecision> ); see also Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments 1785, in The Complete Madison 299, 309 (S. Padover ed. 1953) ("Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Gov[ernment]"); M. Howe, The Garden and the Wilderness 6 (1965) (noting Roger Williams's view that "worldly corruptions .  .  .  might consume the churches if sturdy fences against the wilderness were not maintained").  The ban against state endorsement of religion addresses the same historical lessons.  Governmental approval of religion tends to reinforce the religious message (at least in the short run) and, by the same token, to carry a message of exclusion to those of less favored views.  See, e. g., <citedDecision>Ball, supra, at 390</citedDecision> ("[A]n important concern of the effects test is whether the symbolic union of church and state effected by the challenged governmental action is sufficiently *244 likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a disapproval, of their individual religious choices"); Lee, supra, at 606-607 (Blackmun, J., concurring) ("When the government puts its imprimatur on a particular religion, it conveys a message of exclusion to all those who do not adhere to the favored beliefs.  A government cannot be premised on the belief that allpersons are created equal when it asserts that God prefers some"); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 429 (1962) ("[A]nguish, hardship and bitter strife" result "when zealous religious groups struggl[e] with one another to obtain the Government's stamp of approval").  The human tendency, of course, is to forget the hard lessons, and to overlook the history of governmental partnership with religion when a cause is worthy, and bureaucrats have programs.  That tendency to forget is the reason for having the Establishment Clause (along with the Constitution's other structural and libertarian guarantees), in the hope of stopping the corrosion before it starts.  These principles were violated by the programs at issue in Aguilar and <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> , as a consequence of several significant features common to both Title I, as implemented in New York City before Aguilar , and the Grand Rapids Shared Time program: each provided classes on the premises of the religious schools, covering a wide range of subjects including some at the core of primary and secondary education, like reading and mathematics; while their services were termed "supplemental," the programs and their instructors necessarily assumed responsibility for teaching subjects that the religious schools would otherwise have been obligated to provide, cf. Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 243 (1977) (provision of diagnostic tests to religious schools provides only an incidental benefit); the public employees carrying out the programs had broad responsibilities involving the exercise of considerable discretion, cf. Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 13 (1993) (sign-language interpreter *245 must transmit exactly what is said); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 616-617 (1971) (distinguishing, for Establishment Clause purposes, books provided by the State to students from teachers paid by the State); while the programs offered aid to nonpublic school students generally (and Title I went to public school students as well), participation by religious school students in each program was extensive, cf. Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 488 (1986) (only one student sought state tuition assistance for religious education); and, finally, aid under Title I and Shared Time flowed directly to the schools in the form of classes and programs, as distinct from indirect aid that reaches schools only as a result of independent private choice, cf. Zobrest, supra, at 12 ("[A]ny attenuated financial benefit that parochial schools do ultimately receive .  .  .  is attributable to `the private choices of individual parents' ") (quoting Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 400 (1983)); Witters, supra, at 487 (aid issued to students reached religious institution "only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients"); Mueller, supra, at 399-400 (same).  What, therefore, was significant in Aguilar and <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> about the placement of state-paid teachers into the physical and social settings of the religious schools was not only the consequent temptation of some of those teachers to reflect the schools' religious missions in the rhetoric of their instruction, with a resulting need for monitoring and the certainty of entanglement.  See Aguilar, 473 U. S., at 412-414 (monitoring); Ball, <citedDecision>473 U. S., at 388</citedDecision> (risk of indoctrination).  What was so remarkable was that the schemes in issue assumed a teaching responsibility indistinguishable from the responsibility of the schools themselves.  The obligation of primary and secondary schools to teach reading necessarily extends to teaching those who are having a hard time at it, and the same is true of math.  Calling some classes remedial does not distinguish their subjects from the schools' basic subjects, *246 however inadequately the schools may have been addressing them.  What was true of the Title I scheme as struck down in Aguilar will be just as true when New York reverts to the old practices with the Court's approval after today.  There is simply no line that can be drawn between the instruction paid for at taxpayers' expense and the instruction in any subject that is not identified as formally religious.  While it would be an obvious sham, say, to channel cash to religious schools to be credited only against the expense of "secular" instruction, the line between "supplemental" and general education is likewise impossible to draw.  If a State may constitutionally enter the schools to teach in the manner in question, it must in constitutional principle be free to assume, or assume payment for, the entire cost of instruction provided in any ostensibly secular subject in any religious school.  This Court explicitly recognized this in <citedDecision>Ball, supra, at 394, 396</citedDecision> , and although in Aguilar the Court concentrated on entanglement it noted the similarity to <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> , see Aguilar, supra, at 409 , and Judge Friendly's opinion for the Second Circuit made it expressly clear that there was no stopping place in principle once the public teacher entered the religious schools to teach their secular subjects.  See Felton v. Secretary, U. S. Dept. of Education, 739 F. 2d 48 , 66-67 (CA2 1984), aff'd sub nom. Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985).  It may be objected that there is some subsidy in remedial education even when it takes place off the religious premises, some subsidy, that is, even in the way New York City has administered the Title I program after Aguilar .  In these circumstances, too, what the State does, the religious school need not do; the schools save money and the program makes it easier for them to survive and concentrate their resources on their religious objectives.  This argument may, of course, prove too much, but if it is not thought strong enough to bar even off-premises aid in teaching the basics to religious school pupils (an issue not before the Court in Aguilar or *247 today), it does nothing to undermine the sense of drawing a line between remedial teaching on and off premises.  The off-premises teaching is arguably less likely to open the door to relieving religious schools of their responsibilities for secular subjects simply because these schools are less likely (and presumably legally unable) to dispense with those subjects from their curriculums or to make patently significant cutbacks in basic teaching within the schools to offset the outside instruction; if the aid is delivered outside of the schools, it is less likely to supplant some of what would otherwise go on inside them and to subsidize what remains.  On top of that, the difference in the degree of reasonably perceptible endorsement is substantial.  Sharing the teaching responsibilities within a school having religious objectives is far more likely to telegraph approval of the school's mission than keeping the State's distance would do.  This is clear at every level.  As the Court observed in <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> , "[t]he symbolism of a union between church and state [effected by placing the public school teachers into the religious schools] is most likely to influence children of tender years, whose experience is limited and whose beliefs consequently are the function of environment as much as of free and voluntary choice." 473 U. S., at 390.  When, moreover, the aid goes overwhelmingly to one religious denomination, minimal contact between state and church is less likely to feed the resentment of other religions that would like access to public money for their own worthy projects.  In sum, if a line is to be drawn short of barring all state aid to religious schools for teaching standard subjects, the Aguilar - <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> line was a sensible one capable of principled adherence.  It is no less sound, and no less necessary, today.  II The Court today ignores this doctrine and claims that recent cases rejected the elemental assumptions underlying Aguilar and much of <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> .  But the Court errs.  Its holding *248 that Aguilar and the portion of <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> addressing the Shared Time program are "no longer good law," ante, at 235, rests on mistaken reading.  A Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S., at 13-14 , held that the Establishment Clause does not prevent a school district from providing a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student enrolled in a sectarian school.  The Court today relies solely on Zobrest to support its contention that we have "abandoned the presumption erected in Meek [v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975),] and <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion." Ante, at 223.  Zobrest , however, is no such sanction for overruling Aguilar or any portion of <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> .  In Zobrest , the Court did indeed recognize that the Establishment Clause lays down no absolute bar to placing public employees in a sectarian school, 509 U. S., at 13 , and n. 10, but the rejection of such a per se rule was hinged expressly on the nature of the employee's job, sign-language interpretation (or signing) and the circumscribed role of the signer.  On this point (and without reference to the facts that the benefited student had received the same aid before enrolling in the religious school and the employee was to be assigned to the student, not to the school) the Court explained itself this way: "[T]he task of a sign-language interpreter seems to us quite different from that of a teacher or guidance counselor.  .  .  .  Nothing in this record suggests that a signlanguage interpreter would do more than accurately interpret whatever material is presented to the class as a whole.
**Combined Opinion**
 The Court, however, ignores the careful distinction drawn in Zobrest and insists that a full-time public employee such as a Title I teacher is just like the signer, asserting that "there is no reason to presume that, simply because she enters a parochial school classroom, [this] teacher will depart from her assigned duties and instructions and embark on religious indoctrination .  .  .  ." Ante, at 226.  Whatever may be the merits of this position (and I find it short on merit), it does not enjoy the authority of Zobrest .  The Court may disagree with <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> `s assertion that a publicly employed teacher working in a sectarian school is apt to reinforce the pervasive inculcation of religious beliefs, but its disagreement is fresh law. The Court tries to press Zobrest into performing another service beyond its reach.  The Court says that <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar assumed "that the presence of a public employee on private school property creates an impermissible `symbolic link' between government and religion," ante, at 224, and that Zobrest repudiated this assumption, ibid. First, <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar said nothing about the "mere presence" of public employees at religious schools.  It was <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> that specifically addressed the point and held only that when teachers employed by public schools are placed in religious schools to provide instruction to students during the schoolday a symbolic union of church and state is created and will reasonably *250 be seen by the students as endorsement, see Ball, <citedDecision>473 U. S., at 390-392</citedDecision> ; Aguilar adopted the same conclusion by reference, see 473 U. S., at 409.  Zobrest did not, implicitly or otherwise, repudiate the view that the involvement of public teachers in the instruction provided within sectarian schools looks like a partnership or union and implies approval of the sectarian aim.  On the subject of symbolic unions and the strength of their implications, the lesson of Zobrest is merely that less is less.  B The Court next claims that <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> rested on the assumption that "any and all public aid that directly aids the educational function of religious schools impermissibly finances religious indoctrination, even if the aid reaches such schools as a consequence of private decisionmaking." Ante, at 222.  After <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> , the opinion continues, the Court departed from the rule that "all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid." Ante , at 225.  But this mischaracterizes <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> `s discussion on the point, and misreads Witters and Zobrest as repudiating the more modest proposition on which <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> in fact rested.  Ball did not establish that "any and all" such aid to religious schools necessarily violates the Establishment Clause.  It held that the Shared Time program subsidized the religious functions of the parochial schools by taking over a significant portion of their responsibility for teaching secular subjects.  See 473 U. S., at 396-397.  The Court noted that it had "never accepted the mere possibility of subsidization.  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 See Aguilar, supra, at 406 .  Instead of providing a service the school would not otherwise furnish, the Title I services necessarily relieved a religious school of "an expense that it otherwise would have assumed," Zobrest, supra, at 12 , and freed its funds for other, and sectarian, uses.  Finally, instead of aid that comes to the religious school indirectly in the sense that its distribution results from private decisionmaking, a public educational agency distributes Title I aid in the form of programs and services directly to the religious schools.  In Zobrest and Witters , it was fair to say that individual students were themselves applicants for individual benefits on a scale that could not amount to a systemic supplement.  But under Title I, a local educational agency (which in New York City is the Board of Education) may receive federal funding by proposing programs approved to serve individual students who meet the criteria of need, which it then uses to provide such programs at the religious schools, see App. 28-29, 38, 60, 242-243; students eligible for such programs may not apply directly for Title I funds.  [3] The aid, accordingly, is not even formally aid to the individual students (and even formally individual aid must be seen as aid to a school system when so many individuals receive it that it becomes a significant feature of the system, see Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S., at 264 (opinion of Powell, J.)).  In sum, nothing since <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar and before this litigation has eroded the distinction between "direct and substantial" and "indirect and incidental." That principled line is being breached only here and now.  *253 C The Court notes that aid programs providing benefits solely to religious groups may be constitutionally suspect, while aid allocated under neutral, secular criteria is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion.  Ante, at 230 231.  The opinion then says that <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar "gave this consideration no weight," ante, at 231, and accordingly conflict with a number of decisions.  But what exactly the Court thinks <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> and Aguilar inadequately considered is not clear, given that evenhandedness is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an aid program to satisfy constitutional scrutiny.  Title I services are available to all eligible children regardless of whether they go to religious or public schools, but, as I have explained elsewhere and am not alone in recognizing, see, e. g., Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 846-847 (O'Connor, J., concurring); id. , at 879-885 (Souter, J., dissenting); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 614, 621 (1988), that fact does not define the reach of the Establishment Clause.  If a scheme of government aid results in support for religion in some substantial degree, or in endorsement of its value, the formal neutrality of the scheme does not render the Establishment Clause helpless or the holdings in Aguilar and <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> inapposite.  III Finally, there is the issue of precedent.  Stare decisis is no barrier in the Court's eyes because it reads Aguilar and <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> for exaggerated propositions that Witters and Zobrest are supposed to have limited to the point of abandoned doctrine.  Cf. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173-174 (1989).  The Court's dispensation from stare decisis is, accordingly, no more convincing than its reading of those cases. Since Aguilar came down, no case has held that there need be no concern about a risk that publicly paid school teachers may further religious doctrine; no case has repudiated the distinction between direct and substantial aid *254 and aid that is indirect and incidental; no case has held that fusing public and private faculties in one religious school does not create an impermissible union or carry an impermissible endorsement; and no case has held that direct subsidization of religious education is constitutional or that the assumption of a portion of a religious school's teaching responsibility is not direct subsidization.  The continuity of the law, indeed, is matched by the persistence of the facts.  When Aguilar was decided everyone knew that providing Title I services off the premises of the religious schools would come at substantial cost in efficiency, convenience, and money.  Title I had begun off the premises in New York, after all, and dissatisfaction with the arrangement was what led the city to put the public school teachers into the religious schools in the first place.  See Felton v. Secretary, U. S. Dept. of Education, 739 F. 2d, at 51.

[*]   Title I has been reenacted, in varying forms, over the years, most recently in the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 3518 .  We will refer to the current Title I provisions, which do not differ meaningfully for our purposes from the Title I program referred to in our previous decision in this litigation.  [1] School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 373</citedDecision> (1985), also invalidated a separate program called Community Education that is distinct from the Title I program at issue today.  I do not understand the Court's discussion to implicate Ball' s evaluation of the Community Education program.  [2]  The Court's refusal to recognize the extent of student participation as relevant to the constitutionality of an aid program, see ante, at 229-230, ignores the contrary conclusion in Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), on this very point.  See id. , at 488 (noting, among relevant factors, that "[n]o evidence ha[d] been presented indicating that any other person ha[d] ever sought to finance religious education or activity pursuant to the State's program").  [3]  For this reason, the Court's attempted analogy between Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act fails, see ante, at 228; James Zobrest, unlike students receiving Title I services, applied individually for the interpretative services at issue in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 4 (1993).
