<p id="b590-5">With respect to the merits I agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice Roberts and in the affirmance of the judgment as modified. With respect to the point ,as to jurisdiction I agree with what is said in the opinion of Mr. Justice Roberts as to the right to discuss the National Labor Relations Act being a privilege of a citizen of the United States, but I am not satisfied that the record adequately supports the resting of jurisdiction upon that ground. As to that matter, I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Stone.</p>
