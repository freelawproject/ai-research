<author id="b578-5">Mr. Justice White</author>
<p id="AK6">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b578-6">We granted the petition for writ of certiorari in this case, 414 U. S. 1156 (1974), because it raises important questions concerning the administration of a state prison.</p>
<p id="b578-7">Respondent, on behalf of himself and other inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, Lincoln, Nebraska, filed a complaint under 42 U. S. C. § 1983<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenging several of the practices, rules, and regulations of the Complex. For present purposes, the pertinent <page-number citation-index="1" label="543">*543</page-number>allegations were that disciplinary proceedings did not comply with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution; that the inmate legal assistance program did not meet constitutional standards, and that the regulations governing the inspection of mail to and from attorneys for inmates were unconstitutionally restrictive. Respondent requested damages and injunctive relief.</p>
<p id="b579-5">After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court granted partial relief. 342 F. Supp. 616 (Neb. 1972). Considering itself bound by prior Circuit authority, it rejected the procedural due process claim; but it went on to hold that the prison’s policy of inspecting all incoming and outgoing mail to and from attorneys violated prisoners’ rights of access to the courts and that the restrictions placed on inmate legal assistance were not constitutionally defective.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b580-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="544">*544</page-number>The Court of Appeals reversed, 483 F. 2d 1059 (CA8 1973), with respect to the due process claim, holding that the procedural requirements outlined by this Court in <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U. S. 471 (1972), and <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U. S. 778 (1973), decided after the District Court’s opinion in this case, should be generally followed in prison disciplinary hearings but left the specific requirements, including the circumstances in which counsel might be required, to be determined by the District Court on remand. With respect to a remedy, the court further held that <em>Preiser </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U. S. 475 (1973), forbade the actual restoration of good-time credits in this § 1983 suit but ordered expunged from prison records any determinations of misconduct arrived at in proceedings that failed to comport with due process as defined by the court. The court generally affirmed the judgment of the District Court with respect to correspondence with attorneys,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but ordered further proceedings to determine whether the State was meeting its burden under <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>393 U. S. 483 (1969), to provide legal assistance to prison inmates, the court holding that the State’s duty extended to civil rights cases as well as to habeas corpus proceedings<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b580-5">I</p>
<p id="b580-6">We begin with the due process claim. An understanding of the issues involved requires a detailing of the prison disciplinary regime set down by Nebraska statutes and prison regulations.</p>
<p id="b581-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="545">*545</page-number>Section 16 of the Nebraska Treatment and Corrections Act, as amended, Neb. Rev. Stat. § 83-185 (Cum. Supp. 1972),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides that the chief executive officer of each penal facility is responsible for the discipline of inmates <page-number citation-index="1" label="546">*546</page-number>in a particular institution. The statute provides for a range of possible disciplinary action. “Except in flagrant or serious cases, punishment for misconduct shall consist of deprivation of privileges. In cases of flagrant or serious misconduct, the chief executive officer may order that a person’s reduction of term as provided in section 83-1,107 [good-time credit<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] be forfeited or withheld and <page-number citation-index="1" label="547">*547</page-number>also that the person be confined in a disciplinary cell.” Each breach of discipline is to be entered in the person's file together with the disposition or punishment therefor.</p>
<p id="b583-5">As the statute makes clear, there are basically two kinds of punishment for flagrant or serious misconduct. The first is the forfeiture or withholding of good-time credits, which affects the term of confinement, while the second, confinement in a disciplinary cell, involves alteration of the conditions of confinement. If the misconduct is less than flagrant or serious, only deprivation of privileges results.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b584-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="548">*548</page-number>The only statutory provision establishing procedures for the imposition of disciplinary sanctions which pertains to good time, § 38 of the Nebraska Treatment and Corrections Act, as amended, Neb. Rev. Stat. § 83-1,107 (Cum. Supp. 1972), merely requires that an inmate be “consulted regarding the charges of misconduct” in connection with the forfeiture, withholding, or restoration of credit. But prison authorities have framed written regulations dealing with procedures and policies for controlling inmate misconduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By regulation, misconduct is <page-number citation-index="1" label="549">*549</page-number>classified into two categories: major misconduct is a “serious violation” and must be formally reported to an Adjustment Committee, composed of the Associate Warden <page-number citation-index="1" label="550">*550</page-number>Custody, the Correctional Industries Superintendent, and the Reception Center Director. This Committee is directed to “review and evaluate all misconduct reports” <page-number citation-index="1" label="551">*551</page-number>and, among other things, to “conduct investigations, make findings, [and] impose disciplinary actions.” If only minor misconduct, “a less serious violation,” is involved, <page-number citation-index="1" label="552">*552</page-number>the problem may either be resolved informally by the inmate’s supervisor or it can be formally reported for action to the Adjustment Committee. Repeated minor misconduct must be reported. The Adjustment Committee has available a wide range of sanctions. “Disciplinary action taken and recommended may include but not necessarily be limited to the following: reprimand, restrictions of various kinds, extra duty, confinement in the Adjustment Center [the disciplinary cell], withholding of statutory good time and/or extra earned good time, or a combination of the elements listed herein.” <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b588-4">Additional procedures have been devised by the Complex governing the actions of the Adjustment Committee. Based on the testimony, the District Court found, 342 F. Supp., at 625-626, that the following procedures were in effect when an inmate is written up or charged with a prison violation: <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>
<blockquote id="b588-5">“(a) The chief correction supervisor reviews the 'write-ups’ on the inmates by the officers of the Complex daily;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b589-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="553">*553</page-number>“(b) the convict is called to a conference with the chief correction supervisor and the charging party;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b589-5">“(c) following the conference, a conduct report is sent to the Adjustment Committee;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b589-6">“(d) there follows a hearing before the Adjustment Committee and the report is read to the inmate and discussed;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b589-7">“(e) if the inmate denies charge he may ask questions of the party writing him up ;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b589-8">“(f) the Adjustment'Committee can conduct additional investigations if it desires;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b589-9">“ (g) punishment is imposed.”</blockquote>
<p id="b589-10">II</p>
<p id="b589-11">This class action brought by respondent alleged that the rules, practices, and procedures at the Complex which might result in the taking of good time violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Respondent sought three types of relief: (1) restoration of good time; (2) submission of a plan by the prison authorities for a hearing procedure in connection with withholding and forfeiture of good time which complied with the requirements of due process; and (3) damages for the deprivation of civil rights resulting from the use of the allegedly unconstitutional procedures.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b590-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="554">*554</page-number>At the threshold is the issue whether under <em>Preiser </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U. S. 475 (1973), the validity of the procedures for depriving prisoners of good-time credits may be considered in a civil rights suit brought under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. In <em>Preiser, </em>state prisoners brought a § 1983 suit seeking an injunction to compel restoration of good-time credits. The Court held that because the state prisoners were challenging the very fact or duration of their confinement and were seeking a speedier release, their sole federal remedy was by writ of habeas corpus, 411 U. S., at 500, with the concomitant requirement of exhausting state remedies. But the Court was careful to point out that habeas corpus is not an appropriate or available remedy for damages claims, which, if not frivolous and of sufficient substance to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court, could be pressed under § 1983 along with suits challenging the conditions of confinement rather than the fact or length of custody. 411 U. S., at 494, 498-499.</p>
<p id="b590-5">The complaint in this case sought restoration of good-time credits, and the Court of Appeals correctly held this relief foreclosed under <em>Preiser. </em>But the complaint also sought damages; and <em>Preiser </em>expressly contemplated that claims properly brought under § 1983 could go forward while actual restoration of good-time credits is sought in state proceedings. 411 U. S., at 499 n. 14.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Respondent’s damages claim was therefore properly before the District Court and required determination of the validity of the procedures employed for imposing sanctions, including loss of good time, for flagrant or serious miscon<page-number citation-index="1" label="555">*555</page-number>duct. Such a declaratory judgment as a predicate to a damages award would not be barred by <em>Preiser; </em>and because under that case only an injunction restoring good time improperly taken is foreclosed, neither would it preclude a litigant with standing from obtaining by way of ancillary relief an otherwise proper injunction enjoining the prospective enforcement of invalid prison regulations.</p>
<p id="b591-5">We therefore conclude that it was proper for the Court of Appeals and the District Court to determine the validity of the procedures for revoking good-time credits and to fashion appropriate remedies for any constitutional violations ascertained, short of ordering the actual restoration of good time already canceled.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b591-6">Ill</p>
<p id="b591-7">Petitioners assert that the procedure for disciplining prison inmates for serious misconduct is a matter of policy raising no constitutional issue. If the position implies that prisoners in state institutions are wholly without the protections of the Constitution and the Due Process Clause, it is plainly untenable. Lawful imprisonment necessarily makes unavailable many rights and privileges of the ordinary citizen, a “retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.” <em>Price </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>334 U. S. 266, 285 (1948). But though his rights may be diminished by the needs and exigencies of the institutional environment, a prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional protections when he is imprisoned for crime. There is no iron curtain <page-number citation-index="1" label="556">*556</page-number>drawn between the Constitution and the prisons of this country. Prisoners have been held to enjoy substantial religious freedom under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Beto, </em>405 U. S. 319 (1972); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Pate, </em>378 U. S. 546 (1964). They retain right of access to the courts. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>404 U. S. 15 (1971), aff’g <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>319 F. Supp. 105 (ND Cal. 1970); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>393 U. S. 483 (1969); <em>Ex parte Hull, </em>312 U. S. 546 (1941). Prisoners are protected under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invidious discrimination based on race. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>390 U. S. 333 (1968). Prisoners may also claim the protections of the Due Process Clause. They may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Kerner, </em>404 U. S. 519 (1972); <em>Wilwording </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>404 U. S. 249 (1971); <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U. S. 91 (1945).</p>
<p id="b592-5">Of course, as we have indicated, the fact that prisoners retain rights under the Due Process Clause in no way implies that these rights are not subject to restrictions imposed by the nature of the regime to which they have been lawfully committed. Cf. <em>CSC </em>v. <em>Letter Carriers, </em>413 U. S. 548 (1973); <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U. S. 601 (1973); <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>417 U. S. 733 (1974). Prison disciplinary proceedings are not part of a criminal prosecution, and the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such proceedings does not apply. Cf. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U. S., at 488. In sum, there must be <em>mutual </em>accommodation between institutional needs and objectives and the provisions of the Constitution that are of general application.</p>
<p id="b592-6">. We also reject the assertion of the State that whatever may be true of the Due Process Clause in general or of other rights protected by that Clause against state infringement, the interest of prisoners in disciplinary proce<page-number citation-index="1" label="557">*557</page-number>dures is not included in that “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. It is true that the Constitution itself does not guarantee good-time credit for satisfactory behavior while in prison. But here the State itself has not only provided a statutory right to good time but also specifies that it is to be forfeited only for serious misbehavior. Nebraska may have the authority to create, or not, a right to a shortened prison sentence through the accumulation of credits for good behavior, and it is true that the Due Process Clause does not require a hearing “in every conceivable case of government impairment of private interest.” <em>Cafeteria Workers </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>367 U. S. 886, 894 (1961). But the State having created the right to good time and itself recognizing that its deprivation is a sanction authorized for major misconduct, the prisoner’s interest has real substance and is sufficiently embraced within Fourteenth Amendment “liberty” to entitle him to those minimum procedures appropriate under the circumstances and required by the Due Process Clause to insure that the state-created right is not arbitrarily abrogated. This is the thrust of recent cases in the prison disciplinary context. In <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Kerner, supra, </em>the state prisoner asserted a “denial of due process in the steps leading to [disciplinary] confinement.” 404 U. S., at 520. We reversed the dismissal of the § 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim. In <em>Preiser </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>the prisoner complained that he had been deprived of good-time credits without notice or hearing and without due process of law. We considered the claim a proper subject for a federal habeas corpus proceeding.</p>
<p id="b593-4">This analysis as to liberty parallels the accepted due process analysis as to property. The Court has consistently held that some kind of hearing is required at some time before a person is finally deprived of his property <page-number citation-index="1" label="558">*558</page-number>interests. <em>Anti-Fascist Committee </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>341 U. S. 123, 168 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). The requirement for some kind of a hearing applies to the taking of private property, <em>Grannis </em>v. <em>Ordean, </em>234 U. S. 385 (1914), the revocation of licenses, <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U. S. 544 (1968), the operation of state dispute-settlement mechanisms, when one person seeks to take property from another, or to government-created jobs held, absent “cause” for termination, <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U. S. 564 (1972); <em>Arnett </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>416 U. S. 134, 164 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring); <em>id., </em>at 171 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ; <em>id., </em>at 206 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Cf. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U. S. 645, 652-654 (1972); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson, </em>402 U. S. 535 (1971).</p>
<p id="b594-5">We think a person's liberty is equally protected, even when the liberty itself is a statutory creation of the State. The touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government, <em>Dent </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>129 U. S. 114, 123 (1889). Since prisoners in Nebraska can only lose good-time credits if they are guilty of serious misconduct, the determination of whether such behavior has occurred becomes critical, and the minimum requirements of procedural due process appropriate for the circumstances must be observed.</p>
<p id="b594-6">IV</p>
<p id="b594-7">As found by the District Court, the procedures employed are: (1) a preliminary conference with the Chief Corrections Supervisor and the charging party, where the prisoner is informed of the misconduct charge and engages in preliminary discussion on its merits; (2) the preparation of a conduct report and a hearing held before the Adjustment Committee, the disciplinary body of the prison, where the report is read to the inmate; and <page-number citation-index="1" label="559">*559</page-number>(3) the opportunity at the hearing to ask questions of the charging party. The State contends that the procedures already provided are adequate. The Court of Appeals held them insufficient and ordered that the due process requirements outlined in <em>Morrissey </em>and <em>Scar-pelli </em>be satisfied in serious disciplinary cases at the prison.</p>
<p id="b595-5"><em>Morrissey </em>held that due process imposed certain minimum procedural requirements which must be satisfied before parole could finally be revoked. These procedures were:</p>
<blockquote id="b595-6">“(a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence ; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a 'neutral and detached’ hearing body such as a traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole.” 408 U. S., at 489.</blockquote>
<p id="b595-7">The Court did not reach the question as to whether the parolee is entitled to the assistance of retained counsel or to appointed counsel, if he is indigent. Following the decision in <em>Morrissey, </em>in <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U. S. 778 (1973), the Court held the requirements of due process established for parole revocation were applicable to probation revocation proceedings. The Court added to the required minimum procedures of <em>Morrissey </em>the right to counsel, where a probationer makes a request, “based on a timely and colorable claim (i) that he has not committed the alleged violation of the conditions upon which he is at liberty; or (ii) that, even if the vio<page-number citation-index="1" label="560">*560</page-number>lation is a matter of public record or is uncontested, there are substantial reasons which justified or mitigated the violation and make revocation inappropriate, and that the reasons are complex or otherwise difficult to develop or present.” <em>Id., </em>at 790. In doubtful cases, the agency was to consider whether the probationer appeared to be capable of speaking effectively for himself, <em>id., </em>at 790-791, and a record was to be made of the grounds for refusing to appoint counsel.</p>
<p id="b596-5">We agree with neither petitioners nor the Court of Appeals: the Nebraska procedures are in some respects constitutionally deficient but the <em>Morrissey-Scarpelli </em>procedures need not in all respects be followed in disciplinary cases in state prisons.</p>
<p id="b596-6">We have often repeated that “[t]he very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation.” <em>Cafeteria Workers </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>367 U. S., at 895. “ [C] on-sideration of what procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action.” <em>Ibid.; Morrissey, </em>408 U. S., at 481. Viewed in this light it is immediately apparent that one cannot automatically apply procedural rules designed for free citizens in an open society, or for parolees or probationers under only limited restraints, to the very different situation presented by a disciplinary proceeding in a state prison.</p>
<p id="b596-7">Revocation of parole may deprive the parolee of only conditional liberty, but it nevertheless “inflicts a ‘grievous loss’ on the parolee and often on others.” <em>Id., </em>at 482. Simply put, revocation proceedings determine whether the parolee will be free or in prison, a matter of obvious great moment to him. For the prison inmate, <page-number citation-index="1" label="561">*561</page-number>the deprivation of good time is not the same immediate disaster that the revocation of parole is for the parolee. The deprivation, very likely, does not then and there work any change in the conditions of his liberty. It can postpone the date of eligibility for parole and extend the maximum term to be served, but it is not certain to do so, for good time may be restored. Even if not restored, it cannot be said with certainty that the actual date of parole will be affected; and if parole occurs, the extension of the maximum term resulting from loss of good time may affect only the termination of parole, and it may not even do that. The deprivation of good time is unquestionably a matter of considerable importance. The State reserves it as a sanction for serious misconduct, and we should not unrealistically discount its significance. But it is qualitatively and quantitatively different from the revocation of parole or probation.</p>
<p id="b597-5">In striking the balance that the Due Process Clause demands, however, we think the major consideration militating against adopting the full range of procedures suggested by <em>Morrissey </em>for alleged parole violators is the very different stake the State has in the structure and content of the prison disciplinary hearing. That the revocation of parole be justified and based on an accurate assessment of the facts is a critical matter to the State as well as the parolee; but the procedures by which it is determined whether the conditions of parole have been breached do not themselves threaten other important state interests, parole officers, the police, or witnesses — at least no more so than in the case of the ordinary criminal trial. Prison disciplinary proceedings, on the other hand, take place in a closed, tightly controlled environment peopled by those who have chosen to violate the criminal law and who have been lawfully incarcerated for doing so. Some are first offenders, but many are recidivists who <page-number citation-index="1" label="562">*562</page-number>have repeatedly employed illegal and often very violent means to attain their ends. They may have little regard for the safety of others or their property or for the rules designed to provide an orderly and reasonably safe prison life. Although there are very many varieties of prisons with different degrees of security, we must realize that in many of them the inmates are closely supervised and their activities controlled around the clock. Guards and inmates co-exist in direct and intimate contact. Tension between them is unremitting. Frustration, resentment, and despair are commonplace. Relationships among the inmates are varied and complex and perhaps subject to the unwritten code that exhorts inmates not to inform on a fellow prisoner.</p>
<p id="b598-5">It is against this background that disciplinary proceedings must be structured by prison authorities; and it is against this background that we must make our constitutional judgments, realizing that we are dealing with the maximum security institution as well as those where security considerations are not paramount. The reality is that disciplinary hearings and the imposition of disagreeable sanctions necessarily involve confrontations between inmates and authority and between inmates who are being disciplined and those who would chargé or furnish evidence against them. Retaliation is much more than a theoretical possibility; and the basic and unavoidable task of providing reasonable personal safety for guards and inmates may be at stake, to say nothing of the impact of disciplinary confrontations and the resulting escalation of personal antagonisms on the important aims of the correctional process.</p>
<p id="b598-6">Indeed, it is pressed upon us that the proceedings to ascertain and sanction misconduct themselves play a major role in furthering the institutional goal of modifying the behavior and value systems of prison inmates <page-number citation-index="1" label="563">*563</page-number>sufficiently to permit them to live within the law when they are released. Inevitably there is a great range of personality and character among those who have transgressed the criminal law. Some are more amenable to suggestion and persuasion than others. Some may be incorrigible and would merely disrupt and exploit the disciplinary process for their own ends. With some, rehabilitation may be best achieved by simulating procedures of a free society to the maximum possible extent; but with others, it may be essential that discipline be swift and sure.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In any event, it is argued, there would be great unwisdom in encasing the disciplinary procedures in an inflexible constitutional straitjacket that would necessarily call for adversary proceedings typical of the criminal trial, very likely raise the level of confrontation between staff and inmate, and make more difficult the utilization of the disciplinary process as a tool to advance the rehabilitative goals of the institution. This consideration, along with the necessity to maintain an acceptable level of personal security in the institution, must be taken into account as we now examine in more detail the Nebraska procedures that the Court of Appeals found wanting.</p>
<p id="b599-5">V</p>
<p id="b599-6">Two of the procedures that the Court held should be extended to parolees facing revocation proceedings are not, but must be, provided to prisoners in the Nebraska Complex if the minimum requirements of procedural due process are to be satisfied. These are advance written notice of the claimed violation and a written statement of the factfinders as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken. As described <page-number citation-index="1" label="564">*564</page-number>by the Warden in his oral testimony, on the basis of which the District Court made its findings, the inmate is now given oral notice of the charges against him at least as soon as the conference with the Chief Corrections Supervisor and charging party. A written record is there compiled and the report read to the inmate at the hearing before the Adjustment Committee where the charges are discussed and pursued. There is no indication that the inmate is ever given a written statement by the Committee as to the evidence or informed in writing or otherwise as to the reasons for the disciplinary action taken.</p>
<p id="b600-5">Part of the function of notice is to give the charged party a chance to marshal the facts in his defense and to clarify what the charges are, in fact. See <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U. S. 1, 33-34, and n. 54 (1967). Neither of these functions was performed by the notice described by the Warden. Although the charges are discussed orally with the inmate somewhat in advance of the hearing, the inmate is sometimes brought before the Adjustment Committee shortly after he is orally informed of the charges. Other times, after this initial discussion, further investigation takes place which may reshape the nature of the charges or the evidence relied upon. In those instances, under procedures in effect at the time of trial, it would appear that the inmate first receives notice of the actual charges at the time of the hearing before the Adjustment Committee. We hold that written notice of the charges must be given to the disciplinary-action defendant in order to inform him of the charges and to enable him to marshal the facts and prepare a defense. At least a brief period of time after the notice, no less than 24 hours, should be allowed to the inmate to prepare for the appearance before the Adjustment Committee.</p>
<p id="b600-6">We also hold that there must be a “written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons” for the disciplinary action. <em>Morrissey, </em>408 IT. S., at <page-number citation-index="1" label="565">*565</page-number>489. Although Nebraska does not seem to provide administrative review of the action taken by the Adjustment Committee, the actions taken at such proceedings may involve review by other bodies. They might furnish the basis of a decision by the Director of Corrections to transfer an inmate to another institution because he is considered “to be incorrigible by reason of frequent intentional breaches of discipline,” Neb. Rev. Stat. § 83-185 (4) (Cum. Supp. 1972), and are certainly likely to be considered by the state parole authorities in making parole decisions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Written records of proceedings will thus protect the inmate against collateral consequences based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the original proceeding. Further, as to the disciplinary action itself, the provision for a written record helps to insure that administrators, faced with possible scrutiny by state officials and the public, and perhaps even the courts, where fundamental constitutional rights may have been abridged, will act fairly. Without written records, the inmate will be at a severe disadvantage in propounding his own cause to or defending himself from others. It may be that there will be occasions when personal or institutional safety is so implicated that the statement may properly exclude certain items of evidence, but in that event the statement should indicate the fact of the omission. Otherwise, we perceive no conceivable rehabilitative objective or prospect of prison disruption that can flow from the requirement of these statements.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b602-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="566">*566</page-number>We are also of the opinion that the inmate facing disciplinary proceedings should be allowed to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense when permitting him to do so will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals. Ordinarily, the right to present evidence is basic to a fair hearing; but the unrestricted right to call witnesses from the prison population carries obvious potential for disruption and for interference with the swift punishment that in individual cases may be essential to carrying out the correctional program of the institution. We should not be too ready to exercise oversight and put aside the judgment of prison administrators. It may be that an individual threatened with serious sanctions would normally be entitled to present witnesses and relevant documentary evidence; but here we must balance the inmate’s interest in avoiding loss of good time against the needs of the prison, and some amount of flexibility and accommodation is required. Prison officials must have the necessary discretion to keep the hearing within reasonable limits and to refuse to call witnesses that may create a risk of reprisal or undermine authority, as well as to limit access to other inmates to collect statements or to compile other documentary evidence. Although we do not prescribe it, it would be useful for the Committee to state its reason for refusing to call a witness, whether it be for irrelevance, lack of necessity, or the hazards presented in individual cases. Any less flexible rule appears untenable as a constitutional matter, at least on the record made in this case. The operation of a correctional institution is at best an extraordinarily difficult undertaking. Many prison officials, on the spot and with the responsibility for the safety of inmates and staff, are reluctant to extend the unqualified right to call witnesses; and in our view, they must have the necessary discretion without being subject to unduly crippling constitutional <page-number citation-index="1" label="567">*567</page-number>impediments. There is this much play in the joints of the Due Process Clause, and we stop short of imposing a more demanding rule with respect to witnesses and documents.</p>
<p id="b603-5">Confrontation and cross-examination present greater hazards to institutional interests.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If confrontation and cross-examination of those furnishing evidence against the inmate were to be allowed as a matter of course, as in criminal trials, there would be considerable potential for havoc inside the prison walls. Proceedings would inevitably be longer and tend to unmanageability. These procedures are essential in criminal trials where the accused, if found guilty, may be subjected to the most serious deprivations, <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U. S. 400 (1965), or where a person may lose his job in society, <em>Greene </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>360 U. S. 474, 496-497 (1959). But they are not rights universally applicable to all hearings. See <em>Arnett </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>416 U. S. 134 (1974). Rules of procedure may be shaped by consideration of the risks of error, <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U. S. 358, 368 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring) ; <em>Arnett </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>p. 171 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and should also be shaped by the consequences which will follow their adoption. Although some States do seem to allow cross-examination in disciplinary hearings,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we are not apprised of the conditions under which <page-number citation-index="1" label="568">*568</page-number>the procedure may be curtailed; and it does not appear that confrontation and cross-examination are generally required in this context. We think that the Constitution should not be read to impose the procedure at the present time and that adequate bases for decision in prison disciplinary cases can be arrived at without cross-examination.</p>
<p id="b604-5">Perhaps as the problems of penal institutions change and correctional goals are reshaped, the balance of interests involved will require otherwise. But in the current environment, where prison disruption remains a serious concern to administrators, we cannot ignore the desire and effort of many States, including Nebraska, and the Federal Government to avoid situations that may trigger deep emotions and that may scuttle the disciplinary process as a rehabilitation vehicle. To some extent, the American adversary trial presumes contestants who are able to cope with the pressures and aftermath of the battle, and such may not generally be the case of those in the prisons of this country. At least, the Constitution, as we interpret it today, does not require the contrary assumption. Within the limits set forth in this opinion we are content for now to leave the continuing development of measures to review adverse actions affecting inmates to the sound discretion of corrections officials administering the scope of such inquiries.</p>
<p id="b604-6">We recognize that the problems of potential disruption may differ depending on whom the inmate proposes to cross-examine. If he proposes to examine an unknown fellow inmate, the danger may be the greatest, since the disclosure of the identity of the accuser, and the cross-examination which will follow, may pose a high risk of reprisal within the institution. Conversely, the inmate accuser, who might freely tell his story privately to prison officials, may refuse to testify or admit any knowledge of the situation in question. Although the dangers posed by <page-number citation-index="1" label="569">*569</page-number>cross-examination of known inmate accusers, or guards, may be less, the resentment which may persist after confrontation may still be substantial. Also, even where the accuser or adverse witness is known, the disclosure of third parties may pose a problem. There may be a class of cases where the facts are closely disputed, and the character of the parties minimizes the dangers involved. However, any constitutional rule tailored to meet these situations would undoubtedly produce great litigation and attendant costs in a much wider range of cases. Further, in the last analysis, even within the narrow range of cases where interest balancing may well dictate cross-examination, courts will be faced with the assessment of prison officials as to the dangers involved, and there would be a limited basis for upsetting such judgments. The better course at this time, in a period where prison practices are diverse and somewhat experimental, is to leave these matters to the sound discretion of the officials of state prisons.</p>
<p id="b605-5">As to the right to counsel, the problem as outlined in <em>Scarpelli </em>with respect to parole and probation revocation proceedings is even more pertinent here:</p>
<blockquote id="b605-6">“The introduction of counsel into a revocation proceeding will alter significantly the nature of the proceeding. If counsel is provided for the probationer or parolee, the State in turn will normally provide its own counsel; lawyers, by training and disposition, are advocates and bound by professional duty to present all available evidence and arguments in support of their clients' positions and to contest with vigor all adverse evidence and views. The role of the hearing body itself, aptly described in <em>Mor-rissey </em>as being 'predictive and discretionary’ as well as factfinding, may become more akin to that of a judge at a trial, and less attuned to the rehabilita<page-number citation-index="1" label="570">*570</page-number>tive needs of the individual probationer or parolee. In the greater self-consciousness of its quasi-judicial role, the hearing body may be less tolerant of marginal deviant behavior and feel more pressure to reincarcerate than to continue nonpunitive rehabilitation. Certainly, the decisionmaking process will be prolonged, and the financial cost to the State— for appointed counsel, counsel for the State, a longer record, and the possibility of judicial review — -will not be insubstantial.” 411 U. S., at 787-788 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>
<p id="b606-5">The insertion of counsel into the disciplinary process would inevitably give the proceedings a more adversary cast and tend to reduce their utility as a means to further correctional goals. There would also be delay and very practical problems in providing counsel in sufficient numbers at the time and place where hearings are to be held. At this stage of the development of these procedures we are not prepared to hold that inmates have a right to either retained or appointed counsel in disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<p id="b606-6">Where an illiterate inmate is involved, however, or where the complexity of the issue makes it unlikely that the inmate will be able to collect and present the evidence necessary for an adequate comprehension of the case, he should be free to seek the aid of a fellow inmate, or if that is forbidden, to have adequate substitute aid in the form of help from the staff or from a sufficiently competent inmate designated by the staff. We need not pursue the matter further here, however, for there is no claim that respondent, McDonnell, is within the class of inmates entitled to advice or help from others in the course of a prison disciplinary hearing.</p>
<p id="b606-7">Finally, we decline to rule that the Adjustment Committee which conducts the required hearings at the Ne<page-number citation-index="1" label="571">*571</page-number>braska Prison Complex and determines whether to revoke good time is not sufficiently impartial to satisfy the Due Process Clause. The Committee is made up of the Associate Warden Custody as chairman, the Correctional Industries Superintendent, and the Reception Center Director. The Chief Corrections Supervisor refers cases to the Committee after investigation and an initial interview with the inmate involved. The Committee is not left at large with unlimited discretion. It is directed to meet daily and to operate within the principles stated in the controlling regulations, among which is the command that “[f]ull consideration must be given to the causes for the adverse behavior, the setting and circumstances in which it occurred, the man’s accountability, and the correctional treatment goals,” as well as the direction that "disciplinary measures will be taken only at such times and to such degrees as are necessary to regulate and control a man’s behavior within acceptable limits and will never be rendered capriciously or in the nature of retaliation or revenge.” We find no warrant in the record presented here for concluding that the Adjustment Committee presents such a hazard of arbitrary decisionmaking that it should be held violative of due process of law.</p>
<p id="b607-5">Our conclusion that some, but not all, of the procedures specified in <em>Morrissey </em>and <em>Scarpelli </em>must accompany the deprivation of good time by state prison authorities<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> is <page-number citation-index="1" label="572">*572</page-number>not graven in stone. As the nature of the prison disciplinary process changes in future years, circumstances may then exist which will require further consideration and reflection of this Court. It is our view, however, that the procedures we have now required in prison disciplinary proceedings represent a reasonable accommodation between the interests of the inmates and the needs of the institution.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b609-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="573">*573</page-number>VI</p>
<p id="b609-5">The Court of Appeals held that the due process requirements in prison disciplinary proceedings were to apply retroactively so as to require that prison records containing determinations of misconduct, not in accord with required procedures, be expunged. We disagree and reverse on this point.</p>
<p id="b609-6">The question of retroactivity of new procedural rules affecting inquiries into infractions of prison discipline is effectively foreclosed by this Court’s ruling in <em>Morrissey </em>that the due process requirements there announced were to be “applicable to <em>future </em>revocations of parole,” 408 U. S., at 490 (emphasis supplied). Despite the fact that procedures are related to the integrity of the factfinding <page-number citation-index="1" label="574">*574</page-number>process, in the context of disciplinary proceedings, where less is generally at stake for an individual than at a criminal trial, great weight should be given to the significant impact a retroactivity ruling would have on the administration of all prisons in the country, and the reliance prison officials placed, in good faith, on prior law not requiring such procedures. During 1973, the Federal Government alone conducted 19,000 misconduct hearings, as compared with 1,173 parole revocation hearings, and 2,023 probation revocation hearings. If <em>Morrissey-Scar-pelli </em>rules are not retroactive out of consideration for the burden of federal and state officials, this case is <em>a fortiori. </em>We also note that a contrary holding would be very troublesome for the parole system since performance in prison is often a relevant criterion for parole. On the whole, we do not think that error was so pervasive in the system under the old procedures as to warrant this cost or result.</p>
<p id="b610-5">VII</p>
<p id="b610-6">The issue of the extent to which prison authorities can open and inspect incoming mail from attorneys to inmates, has been considerably narrowed in the course of this litigation. The prison regulation under challenge provided that “[a] 11 incoming and outgoing mail will be read and inspected,” and no exception was made for attorney-prisoner mail. The District Court held that incoming mail from attorneys might be opened if normal contraband detection techniques failed to disclose contraband, and if there was a reasonable possibility that contraband would be included in the mail. It further held that if an incoming letter was marked “privileged,” thus identifying it as from an attorney, the letter could not be opened except in the presence of the inmate. Prison authorities were not to read the mail from attorneys. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court order, <page-number citation-index="1" label="575">*575</page-number>but placed additional restrictions on prison authorities. If there was doubt that a letter was actually from an attorney, "a simple telephone call should be enough to settle the matter,” 483 F. 2d, at 1067, the court thus implying that officials might have to go beyond the face of the envelope, and the “privileged” label, in ascertaining what kind of communication was involved. The court further stated that “the danger that a letter from an attorney, an officer of the court, will contain contraband is ordinarily too remote and too speculative to justify the [petitioners’] regulation permitting the opening and inspection of all legal mail.” <em>Ibid. </em>While methods to detect contraband could be employed, a letter was to be opened only “in the appropriate circumstances” in the presence of the inmate.</p>
<p id="b611-5">Petitioners now concede that they cannot open and <em>read </em>mail from attorneys to inmates, but contend’that they may open all letters from attorneys as long as it is done in the presence of the prisoners. The narrow issue thus presented is whether letters determined or found to be from attorneys may be opened by prison authorities in the presence of the inmate or whether such mail must be delivered unopened if normal detection techniques fail to indicate contraband.</p>
<p id="b611-6">Respondent asserts that his First, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights are infringed, under a procedure whereby the State may open mail from his attorney, even though in his presence and even though it may not be read. To begin with, the constitutional status of the rights asserted, as applied in this situation, is far from clear. While First Amendment rights of correspondents with prisoners may protect against the censoring of inmate mail, when not necessary to protect legitimate governmental interests, see <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>416 U. S. 396 (1974), this Court has not yet recognized First <page-number citation-index="1" label="576">*576</page-number>Amendment rights of prisoners in this context, cf. <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Beto, </em>405 U. S. 319 (1972); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Pate, </em>378 U. S. 546 (1964). Furthermore, freedom from censorship is not equivalent to freedom from inspection or perusal. As to the Sixth Amendment, its reach is only to protect the attorney-client relationship from intrusion in the criminal setting, see <em>Black </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U. S. 26 (1966) ; <em>O’Brien </em>v. <em>United States, </em>386 U. S. 345 (1967); see also <em>Coplon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>89 U. S. App. D. C. 103, 191 F. 2d 749 (1951), while the claim here would insulate all mail from inspection, whether related to civil or criminal matters. Finally, the Fourteenth Amendment due process claim based on access to the courts, <em>Ex parte Hull, </em>312 U. S, 546 (1941); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>393 U. S. 483 (1969); <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>404 U. S. 15 (1971), has not been extended by this Court to apply further than protecting the ability of an inmate to prepare a petition or complaint. Moreover, even if one were to accept the argument that inspection of incoming mail from an attorney placed an obstacle to access to the court, it is far from clear that this burden is a substantial one. We need not decide, however, which, if any, of the asserted rights are operative here, for the question is whether, assuming some constitutional right is implicated, it is infringed by the procedure now found acceptable by the State.</p>
<p id="b612-5">In our view, the approach of the Court of Appeals is unworkable and none of the above rights is infringed by the procedures petitioners now accept. If prison officials had to check in each case whether a communication was from an attorney before opening it for inspection, a near-impossible task of administration would be imposed. We think it entirely appropriate that the State require any such communications to be specially marked as originating from an attorney, with his name and address being given, if they are to receive special treatment. It would also certainly be permissible that prison authorities require <page-number citation-index="1" label="577">*577</page-number>that a lawyer desiring to correspond with a prisoner, <em>first </em>identify himself and his client to the prison officials, to assure that the letters marked privileged are actually from members of the bar. As to the ability to open the mail in the presence of inmates, this could in no way constitute censorship, since the mail would not be read. Neither could it chill such communications, since the inmate’s presence insures that prison officials will not read the mail. The possibility that contraband will be enclosed in letters, even those from apparent attorneys, surely warrants prison officials’ opening the letters. We disagree with the Court of Appeals that this should only be done in “appropriate circumstances.” Since a flexible test, besides being unworkable, serves no arguable purpose in protecting any of the possible constitutional rights enumerated by respondent, we think that petitioners, by acceding to a rule whereby the inmate is present when mail from attorneys is inspected, have done all, and perhaps even more, than the Constitution requires.</p>
<p id="b613-5">VIII</p>
<p id="b613-6">The last issue presented is whether the Complex must make available, and if so has made available, adequate legal assistance, under <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Avery, supra, </em>for the preparation of habeas corpus petitions and civil rights actions by inmates. The issue arises in the context of a challenge to a regulation providing, in pertinent part:</p>
<blockquote id="b613-7">
<em>“Legal Work</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b613-8"><em>“A </em>legal advisor has been appointed by the Warden for the benefit of those offenders who are in need of legal assistance. This individual is an offender who has general knowledge of the law procedure. He is not an attorney and can not represent you as such. “No other offender than the legal advisor is permitted to assist you in the preparation of legal docu<page-number citation-index="1" label="578">*578</page-number>ments unless with the specific written permission of the Warden.”</blockquote>
<p id="b614-6">Respondent contended that this regulation was invalid because it failed to allow inmates to furnish assistance to one another. The District Court assumed that the Warden freely gave permission to inmates to give assistance to each other, and that <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Avery, supra, </em>was thereby satisfied. The Court of Appeals found that the record did not support the assumption and that permission has been denied solely because of the existence of the inmate legal advisor, one of the inmates specially approved by the prison authorities. It decided, therefore, to remand the case to decide whether the one advisor satisfied the requirements of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Avery. </em>In so doing, the court stated that in determining the need for legal assistance, petitioners were to take into account the need for assistance in civil rights actions as well as habeas corpus suits.</p>
<p id="b614-7">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>an inmate was disciplined for violating a prison regulation which prohibited inmates from assisting other prisoners in preparing habeas corpus petitions. The Court held that “unless and until the State provides some reasonable alternative to assist inmates in the preparation of petitions for post-conviction relief,” inmates could not be barred from furnishing assistance to each other. 393 U. S., at 490. The court emphasized that the writ of habeas corpus was of fundamental importance in our constitutional scheme, and since the basic purpose of the writ “is to enable those unlawfully incarcerated to obtain their freedom, it is fundamental that access of prisoners to the courts for the purpose of presenting their complaints may not be denied or obstructed.” <em>Id., </em>at 485. Following Aven/, the Court, in <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Gilmore, supra, </em>affirmed a three-judge court judgment which required state officials to provide indi<page-number citation-index="1" label="579">*579</page-number>gent inmates with access to a reasonably adequate law library for preparation of legal actions.</p>
<p id="b615-5">Petitioners contend that <em>Avery </em>is limited to assistance in the preparation of habeas corpus petitions and disputes the direction of the Court of Appeals to the District Court that the capacity of the inmate adviser be assessed in light of the demand for assistance in civil rights actions as well as in the preparation of habeas petitions. Petitioners take too narrow a view of that decision.</p>
<p id="b615-6">First, the demarcation line between civil rights actions and habeas petitions is not always clear. The Court has already recognized instances where the same constitutional rights might be redressed under either form of relief. Cf. <em>Preiser </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U. S. 475 (1973); <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Kerner, </em>404 U. S. 519 (1972); <em>Wilwording </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>404 U. S. 249 (1971). Second, while it is true that only in habeas actions may relief be granted which will shorten the term of confinement, <em>Preiser, supra, </em>it is more pertinent that both actions serve to protect basic constitutional rights. The right of access to the courts, upon which <em>Avery </em>was premised, is founded in the Due Process Clause and assures that no person will be denied the opportunity to present to the judiciary allegations concerning violations of fundamental constitutional rights. It is futile to contend that the Civil Rights Act of 1871 has less importance in our constitutional scheme than does the Great Writ. The recognition by this Court that prisoners have certain constitutional rights which can be protected by civil rights actions would be diluted if inmates, often “totally or functionally illiterate,” were unable to articulate their complaints to the courts. Although there may be additional burdens on the Complex, if inmates may seek help from other inmates, or from the inmate adviser if he proves adequate, in both habeas and civil rights actions, this should not prove overwhelming. At <page-number citation-index="1" label="580">*580</page-number>present only one inmate serves as legal adviser and it may be expected that other qualified inmates could be found for assistance if the Complex insists on naming the inmates from whom help may be sought.</p>
<p id="b616-5">Finding no reasonable distinction between the two forms of actions, we affirm the Court of Appeals on this point, and as the Court of Appeals suggested, the District Court will assess the adequacy of legal assistance under the reasonable-alternative standard of <em>Avery.</em></p>

<p id="b578-10"> The practices, rules, and regulations of the Complex under challenge in this litigation are only in force at that institution, and are drafted by the Warden, and not by the Director of Correctional Services.

<p id="b579-6"> The District Court also determined that contrary to state statutory provisions certain good time had been taken away for violations which were not “flagrant or serious” within the meaning of the controlling state statute, see n. 5, infra, and ordered that good time be restored for all such offenses. The Court of Appeals affirmed the holding (though not the remedy, see <em>infra, </em>at 544). Petitioners do not challenge that holding in this Court.</p>
<p id="A_Cu">Certain issues originally in contest in this litigation were settled by stipulation and order in the District Court. These concerned such matters as processing inmate letters to sentencing judges, the provision for postage to mail such letters, the adequacy of and access to the prison library, and the availability of a notary service. Others were decided by the District Court, after trial, and were not taken up on appeal to the Court of Appeals. These issues included the denial of use of typewriters to inmates, reprisals against inmates who petition the courts, the number of inmates who could use the prison library at one time, the length of time which could be spent in the library, delay in receiving mail, censorship of letters to the news media and public officials, and limitations on numbers of letters which can be written.

<p id="b588-8"> When a prisoner is isolated in solitary confinement, there appear to be two different types of conditions to which he may be exposed.

<p id="b601-6"> A Survey of Prison Disciplinary Practices and Procedures of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Correctional Facilities and Services (1974), reveals that 98% of the 49 prison systems of the States and the United States answering the questionnaire provided written notice of the charges .to an inmate.

<p id="b607-6"> Although the complaint put at issue the procedures employed with respect to the deprivation of good time, under the Nebraska system, the same procedures are employed where disciplinary confinement is imposed. The deprivation of good time and imposition of “solitary” confinement are reserved for instances where serious misbehavior has occurred. This appears a realistic approach, for it would be difficult for the purposes of procedural due process to distinguish between the procedures that are required where good time is forfeited and those that must be extended when solitary confinement is at issue. The latter represents a major change in the conditions <page-number citation-index="1" label="572">*572</page-number>of confinement and is normally imposed only when it is claimed and proved that there has been a major act of misconduct. Here, as in the case of good time, there should be minimum procedural safeguards as a hedge against arbitra^ determination of the factual predicate for imposition of the sanction. We do not suggest, however, that the procedures required by today’s decision for the deprivation of good time would also be required for the imposition of lesser penalties such as the loss of privileges.</p>

<p id="b608-5"> The Courts of Appeals, which have ruled on procedures required in prison disciplinary proceedings, have been split. Two Circuits have required written notice in advance, <em>Clutchette </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em>497 F. 2d 809 (CA9 1974); <em>United States ex rel. Miller </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>479 F. 2d 701 (CA7 1973), while two have held that oral notice is sufficient, <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Alldredge, </em>492 F. 2d 296 (CA3 1974); <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>483 F. 2d 933 (CA3 1973); <em>Sostre </em>v. <em>McGinnis, </em>442 F. 2d 178 (CA2 1971) (en banc), cert. denied <em>sub nom. Oswald </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>405 U. S. 978 (1972). The Ninth Circuit, <em>Clutchette </em>v. <em>Procunier, supra, </em>has held that a written statement of reasons and a written record of the proceedings must be provided, while the Second and Third Circuits have held to the contrary, <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>Carlson, supra; Sostre </em>v. <em>McGinnis, supra. </em>Two Circuits have held that there is no right to present witnesses at a hearing, <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>Carlson, supra; Sostre </em>v. <em>McGinnis, supra, </em>while one has held that there must be an opportunity to <em>request </em>the calling of witnesses, <em>United States ex rel. Miller </em>v. <em>Twomey, supra. </em>Only the Ninth Circuit, <em>Clutchette </em>v. <em>Procunier, supra, </em>has held that there is the full power and right of an inmate to call witnesses. As to cross-examination, two Circuits have stated that due process does not require this procedure, <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>Carlson, supra; Sostre </em>v. <em>McGinnis, supra. </em>The First Circuit has held that where prison authorities had already extended the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, there is no reason <page-number citation-index="1" label="573">*573</page-number>to force the authorities to call adverse witnesses when the inmate could have, <em>Palmigiano </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>487 F. 2d 1280 (1973). Only the Ninth Circuit, <em>Clutchette </em>v. <em>Procunier, supra, </em>has held that there is a general right of cross-examination, but even that case holds that the right may be limited where there is a legitimate fear that retribution will result. As to counsel, two Circuits have held that there is no right even to lay substitutes, <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>Carlson, supra; Sostre </em>v. <em>McGinnis, supra, </em>while the Third Circuit, <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Alldredge, supra, </em>has held that there is no right to counsel where counsel substitute is provided. The First Circuit, <em>Palmigiano </em>v. <em>Baxter, supra, </em>holds there is a right to retained counsel, even where a staff assistant is available, while the Ninth Circuit, <em>Clutchette </em>v. <em>Procunier, supra, </em>envisions some sanctions at disciplinary proceedings calling for provision of counsel, and has determined that counsel must be provided where a prison rule violation may be punishable by state law. An impartial hearing board has been required, to the extent that a member of the board may not participate in a case as an investigating or reviewing officer, or be a witness, <em>Clutchette </em>v. <em>Procunier, supra; Braxton </em>v. <em>Carlson, supra; United States ex rel. Miller </em>v. <em>Twomey, supra. </em>The Third Circuit, <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Alldredge, supra, </em>has also held, in the context of the federal system where a prisoner whose good time is taken away goes first to a disciplinary committee and then to the Good Time Forfeiture Board, that an associate warden could not sit on both committees.</p>
