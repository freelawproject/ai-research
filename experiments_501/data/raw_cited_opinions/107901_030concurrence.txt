<p id="b716-7">In joining the opinion of the Court, I add a word in response to the dissent of my Brother Harlan, who, I think, has quite misapprehended what the Court’s opinion says.</p>
<p id="b716-8">The Court today does <em>not </em>“pick out particular human activities, characterize them as 'fundamental/, and give them added protection . . . .” To the contrary, the Court simply recognizes, as it must, an established constitutional right, and gives to that right no less protection than the Constitution itself demands.</p>
<p id="b716-9">“The constitutional right to travel from one State to another . . . has been firmly established and repeatedly recognized.” <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guest, </em>383 U. S. 745, 757. This constitutional right, which, of course, includes the right of “entering and abiding in any State in the Union,” <em>Truax </em>v. <em>Raich, </em>239 U. S. 33, 39, is <em>not </em>a mere conditional liberty subject to regulation and control under conven<page-number citation-index="1" label="643">*643</page-number>tional due process or equal protection standards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> “ [T] he right to travel freely from State to State finds constitutional protection that is quite independent of the Fourteenth Amendment.” <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guest, supra, </em>at 760, n. 17.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As we made clear in <em>Guest, </em>it is a right broadly assertable against private interference as well as governmental action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Like the right of association, <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Alabama, 357 </em>U. S. 449, it is a virtually unconditional personal right,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> guaranteed by the Constitution to us all.</p>
<p id="b717-6">It follows, as the Court says, that “the purpose of deterring the in-migration of indigents cannot serve as justification for the classification created by the one-year waiting period, since that purpose is constitutionally impermissible.” And it further follows, as the Court says, that any <em>other </em>purposes offered in support of a <page-number citation-index="1" label="644">*644</page-number>law that so clearly impinges upon the constitutional right of interstate travel must be shown to reflect a <em>compelling </em>governmental interest. This is necessarily true whether the impinging law be a classification statute to be tested against the Equal Protection Clause, or a state or federal regulatory law, to be tested against the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth or Fifth Amendment. As MR. Justice Harlan wrote for the Court more than a decade ago, “[T]o justify the deterrent effect ... on the free exercise ... of their constitutionally protected right . . . a ‘. . . subordinating interest of the State must be compelling.' ” <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra, </em>at 463.</p>
<p id="b718-4">The Court today, therefore, is not “contriving new constitutional principles.” It is deciding these cases under the aegis of established constitutional law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>
<footnote label="1">
<p id="b717-7"> By contrast, the “right” of international travel has been considered to be no more than an aspect of the “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Dulles, </em>357 U. S. 116, 125; <em>Aptheker </em>v. <em>Secretary of State, </em>378 U. S. 500, 505-506. As such, this “right,” the Court has held, can be regulated within the bounds of due process. <em>Zemel </em>v. <em>Rusk, </em>381 U. S. 1.</p>

<p id="b717-8"> The constitutional right of interstate travel was fully recognized long before adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. See the statement of Chief Justice Taney in the <em>Passenger Cases, </em>7. How. 283, 492:</p>
<p id="b717-9">“For all the great purposes for which the Federal government was formed, we are one people, with one common country. We are all citizens of the United States; and, as members of the same community, must have the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States.”</p>

<p id="b717-10"> Mr. Justice Harlan was alone in dissenting from this square holding in <em>Guest. Supra, </em>at 762.</p>

<p id="b717-11"> The extent of emergency governmental power temporarily to prevent or control interstate travel, <em>e. g., </em>to a disaster area, need not be considered in these cases.</p>

<p id="b718-9"> It is to be remembered that the Court today <em>affirms </em>the judgments of three different federal district courts, and that at least four other federal courts have reached the same result. See <em>ante, </em>at 622, n. 1.</p>
