 The tax is levied at varying rates depending on the value, energy content, and method of extraction of the coal, and may equal, at a maximum, 30% of the “contract sales price.” 1 Under the terms of a 1976 amendment to the Montana Constitution, after December 31, 1979, at least 50% of the revenues generated by the tax must be paid into a permanent trust fund, the principal of which may be appropriated only by a vote of three-fourths of the members of each house of the legislature.  Mont. Const., Art. IX, § 5.  Appellants, 4 Montana coal producers and 11 of their out-of-state utility company customers, filed these suits in Montana state court in 1978.  They sought refunds of over $5.4 million in severance taxes paid under protest, a declaration that the tax is invalid under the Supremacy and Commerce Clauses, and an injunction against further collection of the tax. Without receiving any evidence, the court upheld the tax and dismissed the complaints.  On appeal, the Montana Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. -Mont.-, 615 P. 2d 847 (1980).  The Supreme Court held that the tax is not subject to scrutiny under the Commerce Clause 2 because it is imposed on the severance of coal, which the court characterized as an intrastate activity preceding entry of the coal into interstate *614 commerce.  In this regard, the Montana court relied on this Court’s decisions in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., <citedDecision>260 U. S. 245</citedDecision> (1922), Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, 262 U. S. 172 (1923), and Hope Natural Gas Co. v. Hall, 274 U. S. 284 (1927), which employed similar reasoning in upholding state severance taxes against Commerce Clause challenges.  As an alternative basis for its resolution of the Commerce Clause issue, the Montana court held, as a matter of law, that the tax survives scrutiny under the four-part test articulated by this Court in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977).  The Montana court also rejected appellants’ Supremacy Clause 3 challenge, concluding that appellants had failed to show that the Montana tax conflicts with any federal statute.  We noted probable jurisdiction, 449 TJ. S. 1033 (1980), to consider the important issues raised.  We now affirm.  II A As an initial matter, appellants assert that the Montana Supreme Court erred in concluding that the Montana tax is not subject to the strictures of the Commerce Clause.  In appellants’ view, Heisler’s “mechanical” approach, which looks to whether a state tax is levied on goods prior to their entry into interstate commerce, no longer accurately reflects the law. Appellants contend that the correct analysis focuses on whether the challenged tax substantially affects interstate commerce, in which case it must be scrutinized under the Complete Auto Transit test.  We agree that Heisler’s reasoning has been undermined by more recent cases. The <citedDecision>Heisler</citedDecision> analysis evolved at a time when the Commerce Clause was thought to prohibit the States from imposing any direct taxes on interstate commerce.  *615 See, e. g., Helson & Randolph v. Kentucky, 279 U. S. 245, 250-252 (1929); Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v. Monier, 266 U. S. 555, 562 (1925).  Consequently, the distinction between intrastate activities and interstate commerce was crucial to protecting the States’ taxing power.  4 The Court has, however, long since rejected any suggestion that a state tax or regulation affecting interstate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches only to a “local” or intrastate activity.  See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333, 350 (1977); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 141-142 (1970); Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S. 416, 423-424 (1946).  Correspondingly, the Court has rejected the notion that state taxes levied on interstate commerce are per se invalid.  See, e. g., Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734 (1978); Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra. In reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes, our goal has instead been to “establish a consistent and rational method of inquiry” focusing on “the practical effect of a challenged tax.” Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S. 425, 443 (1980).

 We conclude that the same “practical” analysis should apply in reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state severance taxes.  In the first place, there is no real distinction — in terms of economic effects — between severance taxes and other types of state taxes that have been subjected to Commerce Clause scrutiny.  5 See, e. g., Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157 (1954); Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., 330 U. S. 422 (1947), Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n, 302 U. S. 90 (1937), both overruled in Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., supra. 6 State taxes levied on a “local” activity preceding entry of the goods into interstate commerce may substantially affect interstate commerce, and this effect is the proper focus of Commerce Clause inquiry.  See Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, supra, at 443.  Second, this Court has acknowledged that “a State has a significant interest in exacting from interstate commerce its fair share of the cost of state government,” Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., supra, at 748.  As the Court has stated, “ ‘[e]ven interstate business must pay its way.’ ” Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938), quoting Postal Telegraph-Cable *617 Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252, 259 (1919).  Consequently, the <citedDecision>Heisler</citedDecision> Court’s concern that a loss of state taxing authority would be an inevitable result of subjecting taxes on “local” activities to Commerce Clause scrutiny is no longer tenable.  We therefore hold that a state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce.  Any contrary statements in <citedDecision>Heisler</citedDecision> and its progeny are disapproved.  7 We agree with appellants that the Montana tax must be evaluated under Complete Auto Transit’s four-part test.  Under that test, a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it “is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.” 430 U. S., at 279 .  B Appellants do not dispute that the Montana tax satisfies the first two prongs of the Complete Auto Transit test.  As the Montana Supreme Court noted, “there can be no argument here that a substantial, in fact, the only nexus of the severance of coal is established in Montana.” -Mont., at-, 615 P. 2d, at 855 .  Nor is there any question here regarding apportionment or potential multiple taxation, for as the state court observed, “the severance can occur in no other state” and “no other state can tax the severance.” Ibid. Appellants do contend, however, that the Montana tax is invalid under the third and fourth prongs of the Complete Auto Transit test.  Appellants assert that the Montana tax “discriminate [s] against interstate commerce” because 90% of Montana coal is shipped to other States under contracts that shift the tax burden primarily to non-Montana utility companies and thus *618 to citizens of other States.  But the Montana tax is computed at the same rate regardless of the final destination of the coal, and there is no suggestion here that the tax is administered in a manner that departs from this evenhanded formula.  We are not, therefore, confronted here with the type of differential tax treatment of interstate and intrastate commerce that the Court has found in other “discrimination” cases. See, e. g., Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725 (1981); Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U. S. 318 (1977); cf. Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27 (1980); Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978).  Instead, the gravamen of appellants’ claim is that a state tax must be considered discriminatory for purposes of the Commerce Clause if the tax burden is borne primarily by out-of-state consumers.  Appellants do not suggest that this assertion is based on any of this Court’s prior discriminatory tax cases. In fact, a similar claim was considered and rejected in <citedDecision>Heisler</citedDecision> .  There, it was argued that Pennsylvania had a virtual monopoly of anthracite coal and that, because 80% of the coal was shipped out of State, the tax discriminated against and impermissibly burdened interstate commerce.  <citedDecision>260 U. S., at 251-253</citedDecision> .  The Court, however, dismissed these factors as “adventitious considerations.” <citedDecision>Id., at 259</citedDecision> .  We share the <citedDecision>Heisler</citedDecision> Court’s misgivings about judging the validity of a state tax by assessing the State’s “monopoly” position or its “exportation” of the tax burden out of State.  The premise of our discrimination cases is that “[t]he very purpose of the Commerce Clause was to create an area of free trade among the several States.” McLeod v. J. E. Dilworth Co., 322 U. S. 327, 330 (1944).  See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S., at 350 ; Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, supra, at 328.  Under such a regime, the borders between the States are essentially irrelevant.  As the Court stated in West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229, 255 (1911), “‘in matters of foreign *619 and interstate commerce there are no state lines.’ ” See Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, supra, at 331-332.  Consequently., to accept appellants’ theory and invalidate the Montana tax solely because most of Montana’s coal is shipped across the very state borders that ordinarily are to be considered irrelevant would require a significant and, in our view, unwarranted departure from the rationale of our prior discrimination cases. Furthermore, appellants’ assertion that Montana may not “exploit” its “monopoly” position by exporting tax burdens to other States, cannot rest on a claim that there is need to protect the out-of-state Consumers of Montana coal from discriminatory tax treatment.  As previously noted, there is no real discrimination in this case; the tax burden is borne according to the amount of coal consumed and not according to any distinction between in-state and out-of-state consumers.

 .” U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  The “Constitution, and the Laws of the United States .  .  .  shall be the supreme Law of the Land ....’’ U. S. Const., Art. VI, el.  2.  The <citedDecision>Heisler</citedDecision> Court explained that any other approach would “nationalize all industries, it would nationalize and withdraw from state jurisdiction and deliver to federal commercial control the fruits of California and the South, the wheat of the West and its meats, the cotton of the South, the shoes of Massachusetts and the woolen industries of other States, at the very inception of their production or growth, that is, the fruits unpicked, the cotton and wheat ungathered, hides and flesh of cattle yet ‘on the hoof,’ wool yet unshorn, and coal yet unmined, because they are .in varying percentages destined for and surely to be exported to States other than those of their production.” <citedDecision>260 U. S., at 259-260</citedDecision> .  Of course, the “fruits of California” and the “wheat of the West” have long since been held to be within the reach of the Commerce Clause.  Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137 (1970); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942).  The <citedDecision>Heisler</citedDecision> approach has been criticized as unresponsive to economic reality.  See Hellerstein, Constitutional Constraints on State and Local Taxation of Energy Resources, 31 Nat. Tax. J. 245, 249 (1978); Brown, The Open Economy: Justice Frankfurter and the Position of the Judiciary, 67 Yale L. J. 219, 232-233 (1957); Developments in the Law: Federal Limitations on State Taxation of Interstate Business, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 953 , 970-971 (1962) (Developments).  The <citedDecision>Heisler</citedDecision> approach has forced the Court to draw distinctions that can only be described as opaque.  Compare, for example, East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Comm’n, 283 U. S. 465 (1931) (movement of gas into local supply lines at reduced pressure constitutes local business), with State Tax Comm’n v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., 284 U. S. 41 (1931) (movement of gas into local supply lines constitutes part of interstate business).  This is not to suggest, however, that <citedDecision>Heisler</citedDecision> and its progeny were wrongly decided.  Nor do we share appellants’ apparent view that the Commerce Clause injects principles of antitrust law into the relations between the States by reference to such imprecise standards as whether one State is “exploiting” its “monopoly” position with respect to a natural resource when the flow of commerce among them is not otherwise impeded.  The threshold questions whether a State enjoys a “monopoly” position and whether the tax burden is shifted out of State, rather than 'borne by in-state producers and consumers, would require complex factual inquiries about such issues as elasticity of demand for the product and alternative sources of supply.  Moreover, under this approach, the constitutionality of a state tax could *620 well turn on whether the in-state producer is able, through sales contracts or otherwise, to shift the burden of the tax forward to its out-of-state customers.  As the Supreme Court of Montana observed, “[i]t would be strange indeed if the legality of a tax could be made to depend on the vagaries of the terms of contracts.” — Mont. —, —, 615 P. 2d 847, 856 (1980).  It has been suggested that the “formidable evidentiary difficulties in appraising the geographical distribution of industry, with a view toward determining a state’s monopolistic position, might make the Court’s inquiry futile.” Developments, supra n. 5, at 970.  See Hellerstein, supra n. 5.
