 They preserved the petitioner’s end of conversations concerning the placing of bets and the receipt of wagering information.  On the single occasion when the statements of another person were inadvertently intercepted, the agents refrained from listening to them.  Although the protections afforded the petitioner in Osborn were “similar ... to those ... of conventional warrants,” they were not identical.  A conventional warrant ordinarily serves to notify the suspect of an intended search.  But if Osborn had been told in advance that federal officers intended to record his conversations, the point of making such recordings would obviously have been lost; the evidence in question could not have been obtained.  In omitting any requirement of advance notice, the federal court that authorized electronic surveillance in Osborn simply recognized, as has this Court, that officers need not announce their purpose before conducting an otherwise authorized search if such an announcement would provoke the escape of the suspect or the destruction of critical evidence.  See Ker v. California, <citedDecision>374 U. S. 23, 37-41</citedDecision> .  Although some have thought that this “exception to the notice requirement where exigent circumstances are present,” <citedDecision>id., at 39</citedDecision> , should be deemed inapplicable where police enter a home before its occupants are aware that officers are present, <citedDecision>id., at 55-58</citedDecision> (opinion of Mr. Justice BrenNAN), the reasons for such a limitation have no bearing here.  However true it may be that “[i]nnocent citizens should not suffer the shock, fright or embarrassment attendant upon an unannounced police intrusion,” <citedDecision>id., at 57</citedDecision> , and that “the requirement of awareness .  .  .  serves to minimize the hazards of the officers’ dangerous calling,” <citedDecision>id., at 57-58</citedDecision> , these considerations are not rele *356 vant to the problems presented by judicially authorized electronic surveillance.  Nor do the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure impose an inflexible requirement of prior notice.  Rule 41 (d) does require federal officers to serve upon the person searched a copy of the warrant and a receipt describing the material obtained, but it does not invariably require that this be done before the search takes place.  Nordelli v. United States, 24 F. 2d 665, 666-667 .  Thus the fact that the petitioner in Osborn was unaware that his words were being electronically transcribed did not prevent this Court from sustaining his conviction, and did not prevent the Court in Berger from reaching the conclusion that the use of the recording device sanctioned in Osborn was entirely lawful.  388 U. S. 41, 57 .  Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 464 (dissenting opinion of Me. Justice BRENNAN).
