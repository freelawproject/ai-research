 “Good faith” is considered by OCC in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed, § 93(b)(2), but a penalty ean be imposed even in the absence of bad faith.  The fact that petitioners’ “good faith” was considered in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed in this case is irrelevant, as we look only'to “the statute on its face” to determine whether a penalty is criminal in nature.  Kennedy, 372 U. S., at 169 .  Similarly, while debarment may be imposed for a “willful” disregard “for the safety or soundness of [an] insured depository institution,” *105 willfulness is not a prerequisite to debarment; it is sufficient that the disregard for the safety and soundness of the institution was “continuing." § 1818(e)(1)(C)(ii).  Fourth, the conduct for which OCC sanctions are imposed may also be criminal (and in this ease formed the basis for petitioners’ indictments).  This fact is insufficient to render the money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, 518 U. S., at 292 , particularly in the double jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, <citedDecision>509 U. S. 688, 704</citedDecision> (1993) (rejecting “same-conduct” test for double jeopardy purposes).  Finally, we recognize that the imposition of both money penalties and debarment sanctions will deter others from emulating petitioners’ conduct, a traditional goal of criminal punishment.  But the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence “may serve civil as well as criminal goals.” Ursery, supra, at 292 ; see also Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 452 (1996) (“[Forfeiture .  .  .  serves a deterrent purpose distinct from any punitive purpose”).  For example, the sanctions at issue here, while intended to deter future wrongdoing, also serve to promote the stability of the banking industry.
