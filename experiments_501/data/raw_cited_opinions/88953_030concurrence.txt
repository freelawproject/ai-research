<p id="AxM">with whom concurred Mr. Justice DAVIS, dissenting.</p>
<p id="AmY">I cannot concur in the. judgment wüich has just been announced. A State has the right to exclude, foreign insurance'companies from the transaction of business within its jurisdiction. Such is the settled law in this court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The right to impose' conditions upon admission follows, as a nec<page-number citation-index="1" label="459">*459</page-number>essary consequence, from the right to exclude altogether. The State of Wisconsin has made it a condition of admission that the- company shall submit to be sued in the courts she has provided for the settlement of the rights of her own citizens.- That is no more than saying that the foreign company must,'for the purposes of ail litigation growing out of the business transacted there, renounce its foreign citizenship and become pro <em>tanto </em>a citizen of that State. There is no hardship in this, for it imposes no greater burden than rests upon home companies and home insurers. •</p>
<p id="b483-6">This insurance company accepted, this condition, and was thus enabled to make the contract sued upon. Having received the benefits of its renunciation the revocation comes too late.</p>
<p id="b483-7">The State court had jurisdiction to try the question of citizenship upon the petition to transfer. Upon the facts I think it was authorized to find that the company was, for all the purposes of that action, a citizen of Wisconsin, and-refuse the order of removal.</p>
