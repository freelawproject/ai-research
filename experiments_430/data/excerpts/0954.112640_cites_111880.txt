 We rejected this claim, explaining that the costs associated with an ignorant or inadvertent procedural default are no less than where the failure to raise a claim is a deliberate strategy: It deprives the state courts of the opportunity to review trial errors.  When a federal habeas court hears such a claim, it undercuts the State’s ability to enforce its procedural rules just as surely as when the default was deliberate.  477 U. S., at 487.  We concluded: “So long as a defendant is represented by counsel whose performance is not constitutionally ineffective under the standard established in Strickland v. Washington, [ 466 U. S. 668 (1984)], we discern no inequity in requiring him to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.” Id., at 488.  Applying the Carrier rule as stated, this case is at an end.  There is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings.  Pennsylvania v. Finley, <citedDecision>481 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1987); Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989) (applying the rule to capital cases).  Consequently, a petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings.  See Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U. S. 586 (1982) (where there is no constitutional right to counsel there can be no deprivation of effective assistance).  Coleman contends that it was his attorney’s error that led to the late filing of his state habeas appeal.  This error cannot be constitutionally ineffective; therefore Coleman must “bear *753 the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.” Coleman attempts to avoid this reasoning by arguing that Carrier does not stand for such a broad proposition.  He contends that Carrier applies by its terms only in those situations where it is possible to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.  Where there is no constitutional right to counsel, Coleman argues, it is enough that a petitioner demonstrate that his attorney’s conduct would meet the Strickland standard, even though no independent Sixth Amendment claim is possible.

 *755 B Among the claims Coleman brought in state habeas, and then again in federal habeas, is ineffective assistance of counsel during trial, sentencing, and appeal.  Coleman contends that, at least as to these claims, attorney error in state ha-beas must constitute cause.  This is because, under Virginia law at the time of Coleman’s trial and direct appeal, ineffective assistance of counsel claims related to counsel’s conduct during trial or appeal could be brought only in state habeas.  See Walker v. Mitchell, 224 Va. 568, 571 , 299 S. E. 2d 698, 699-700 (1983); Dowell v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 555, 562 , 351 S. E. 2d 915, 919 (1987).  Coleman argues that attorney error in failing to file timely in the first forum in which a federal claim can be raised is cause.  We reiterate that counsel’s ineffectiveness will constitute cause only if it is an independent constitutional violation.  <citedDecision>Finley</citedDecision> and Giarratano established that there is no right to counsel in state collateral proceedings.  For Coleman to prevail, therefore, there must be an exception to the rule of <citedDecision>Finley</citedDecision> and Giarratano in those cases where state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction.  • We need not answer this question broadly, however, for one state court has addressed Coleman’s claims: the state habeas trial court. The effectiveness of Coleman’s counsel before that court is not at issue here.  Coleman contends that it was the ineffectiveness of his counsel during the appeal from that determination that constitutes cause to excuse his default.  We thus need to decide only whether Coleman had a constitutional right to counsel on appeal from the state habeas trial court judgment.  We conclude that he did not.  Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 (1963), established that an indigent criminal defendant has a right to appointed counsel in his first appeal as of right in state court. Evitts v. Lucey, sUpra, held that this right encompasses a right to effective assistance of counsel for all criminal defendants in *756 their first appeal as of right.  We based our holding in Douglas on that “equality demanded by the Fourteenth Amendment.” 372 U. S., at 358.  Recognizing that “[a]bsolute equality is not required,” we nonetheless held that “where the merits of the one and only appeal an indigent has as of right are decided without benefit of counsel, we think an unconstitutional line has been drawn between rich and poor.” Id., at 357 (emphasis in original).  Coleman has had his “one and only appeal,” if that is what a state collateral proceeding may be considered; the Buchanan County Circuit Court, after a 2-day evidentiary hearing, addressed Coleman’s claims of trial error, including his ineffective assistance of counsel claims.  What Coleman requires here is a right to counsel on appeal from that determination.  Our case law will not support it.  In Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600 (1974), and Pennsylvania v. Finley, <citedDecision>481 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1987), we declined to extend the right to counsel beyond the first appeal of a criminal conviction.  We held in Ross that neither the fundamental fairness required by the Due Process Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee necessitated that States provide counsel in state discretionary appeals where defendants already had one appeal as of right.  “The duty of the State under our cases is not to duplicate the legal arsenal that may be privately retained by a criminal defendant in a continuing effort to reverse his conviction, but only to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State’s appellate process.” 417 U. S., at 616 .  Similarly, in <citedDecision>Finley</citedDecision> we held that there is no right to counsel in state collateral proceedings after exhaustion of direct appellate review.  <citedDecision>481 U. S., at 556</citedDecision> (citing Ross, supra).  These cases dictate the answer here.  Given that a criminal defendant has no right to counsel beyond his first appeal in pursuing state discretionary or collateral review, it would defy logic for us to hold that Coleman had a right to counsel *757 to appeal a state collateral determination of his claims of trial error.  Because Coleman had no right to counsel to pursue his appeal in state habeas, any attorney error that led to the default of Coleman’s claims in state court cannot constitute cause to excuse the default in federal habeas.  As Coleman does not argue in this Court that federal review of his claims is necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice, he is barred from bringing these claims in federal habeas.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.  This rule does not apply if the petitioner failed to exhaust state remedies and the court to which the petitioner would be required to present his claims in order to meet the exhaustion requirement would now find the claims procedurally barred.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice White, concurring. I concur in the judgment of the Court and I join in its opinion, but add a few words concerning what occurred below. Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255 (1989), stated that “a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case ‘ “clearly and expressly” ’ states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar. ” Id., at 263 , quoting Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 327 (1985), in turn quoting Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1983). If there were nothing before us but the order granting the State’s motion to dismiss for untimeliness, it would be clear enough that the dismissal was based on a procedural default. But the state court did not grant the State’s explicit request for an early ruling on the motion. Instead, the court delayed ruling on the motion to dismiss, and hence briefs on both the motion and the merits were filed. Six months later, the court “upon consideration whereof” granted the State’s motion to dismiss the appeal. Hence petitioner’s argument that the court studied the merits of the federal claims to determine whether to waive the procedural default, found those claims lacking, and only then granted the motion to dismiss; it is as though the court had said that it was granting the motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely because the federal *758 claims were untenable and provided the court no reason to waive the default. The predicate for this argument is that on occasion the Virginia Supreme Court waives the untimeliness rule. If that were true, the rule would not be an adequate and independent state ground barring direct or habeas review. Cf. Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75 (1985). The filing of briefs and their consideration would do no more than buttress the claim that the rule is not strictly enforced. Petitioner argues that the Virginia court does in fact waive the rule on occasion, but I am not now convinced that there is a practice of waiving the rule when constitutional issues are at stake, even fundamental ones. The evidence is too scanty to permit a conclusion that the rule is no longer an adequate and independent state ground barring federal review. The fact that merits briefs were filed and were considered by the court, without more, does not justify a different conclusion.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 If the previous reasoned judgment rests on a procedural default, and the subsequent court wishes to forgive that default, it now must clearly and expressly indicate that its judgment does not rest on a state procedural default.  I see no benefit in abandoning a clear rule to create chaos.  Ill Having abandoned the plain-statement rule with respect to a summary order, the majority must consider Coleman’s argument that the untimely filing of his notice of appeal was the result of attorney error of sufficient magnitude as to constitute cause for his procedural default.  In a sleight of logic that would be ironic if not for its tragic consequences, the majority concludes that a state prisoner pursuing state collateral relief must bear the risk of his attorney’s grave errors — even if the result of those errors is that the prisoner will be executed without having presented his federal claims to a federal court — because this attribution of risk represents the appropriate “allocation of costs.” Ante, at 754.  Whether unprofessional attorney conduct in a state postconviction proceeding should bar federal habeas review of a state prisoner’s *772 conviction and sentence of death is not a question of costs to be allocated most efficiently.  It is, rather, another circumstance where this Court must determine whether federal rights should yield to state interests.  In my view, the obligation of a federal habeas court to correct fundamental constitutional violations, particularly in capital cases, should not accede to the State’s “discretion to develop and implement programs to aid prisoners seeking to secure postconviction review.” Pennsylvania v. Finley, <citedDecision>481 U. S. 551, 559</citedDecision> (1987).  The majority first contends that this Court’s decision in Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986), expressly resolves this issue.  Of course, that cannot be so, as the procedural default at issue in Murray occurred on direct review, not collateral attack, and this Court has no authority to resolve issues not before it.  Moreover, notwithstanding the majority’s protestations to the contrary, the language of Murray strongly suggests that the Court’s resolution of the issue would have been the same regardless of when the procedural default occurred.  The Court in Murray explained: “A State’s procedural rules serve vital purposes at trial, on appeal, and on state collateral attack.” 477 U. S., at 490 (emphasis added).  Rejecting Carrier’s argument that, with respect to the standard for cause, procedural defaults on appeal should be treated differently from those that occur during the trial, the Court stated that “the standard for cause should not vary depending on the timing of a procedural default or on the strength of an uncertain and difficult assessment of the relative magnitude of the benefits attributable to the state procedural rules that attach at each successive stage of the judicial process.” Id., at 491 (emphasis added).  The rule foreshadowed by this language, which the majority today evades, most faithfully adheres to a principled view of the role of federal habeas jurisdiction.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 No rule, however, can deter gross incompetence.  To permit a procedural default caused by attorney error egregious enough to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel to preclude federal habeas review of a state prisoner’s federal claims in no way serves the State’s interest in preserving the integrity of its rules and proceedings.  The interest in finality, standing alone, cannot provide a sufficient reason for a federal habeas court to compromise its protection of constitutional rights.  The majority’s conclusion that Coleman’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, if true, would not excuse a procedural default that occurred in the state postconviction proceeding is particularly disturbing because, at the time of Coleman’s appeal, state law precluded defendants from raising certain claims on direct appeal.  As the majority acknowledges, under state law as it existed at the time of Coleman’s trial and appeal, Coleman could raise his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim with respect to counsel’s conduct during trial and appeal only in state habeas.  Ante, at 755.  This Court has made clear that the Fourteenth Amendment obligates a State “‘to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State’s appellate process,’” <citedDecision>Pennsylvania</citedDecision> v. Finley, <citedDecision>481 U. S., at 556</citedDecision> , quoting Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 616 (1974), and “require[s] that the state appellate system be ‘free from unreasoned distinctions,’” id,., at 612.  While the State may have wide latitude to structure its appellate process as it deems most effective, it cannot, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, structure it in such a way as to deny indigent defendants meaningful access.  Accordingly, if a State desires to remove from the process of direct appellate review a claim or category of claims, the Fourteenth Amendment binds the State to ensure that the defendant has effective assistance of counsel for the entirety of the procedure *774 where the removed claims may be raised.  Similarly, fundamental fairness dictates that the State, having removed certain claims from the process of direct review, bear the burden of ineffective assistance of counsel in the proceeding to which the claim has been removed.  Ultimately, the Court’s determination that ineffective assistance of counsel cannot constitute cause of a procedural default in a state postconviction proceeding is patently unfair.  In concluding that it was not inequitable to apply the cause and prejudice standard to procedural defaults that occur on appeal, the Murray Court took comfort in the “additional safeguard against miscarriages of justice in criminal cases”: the right to effective assistance of counsel.  477 U. S., at 496 .

As Coleman does not argue in this Court that federal review of his claims is necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice, he is barred from bringing these claims in federal habeas.
