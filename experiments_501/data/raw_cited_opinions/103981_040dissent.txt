<p id="AVW">dissenting:</p>
<p id="b212-10">A sovereign State is now before us, summoned on the charge that it has obtained convictions by methods so unfair that a federal court must set aside what the state courts have done. Heretofore the State has had the benefit of a presumption of regularity and legality. A confession made by one in custody heretofore has been <page-number citation-index="1" label="157">*157</page-number>admissible in evidence unless it was proved and found that it was obtained by pressures so strong that it was <em>in fact </em>involuntarily made, that the individual will of the particular confessor had been overcome by torture, mob violence, fraud, trickery, threats, or promises. Even where there was excess and abuse of power on the part of officers, the State still was entitled to use the confession if upon examination of the whole evidence it was found to negative the view that the accused had “so lost his freedom of action that the statements made were not his but were the result of the deprivation of his free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer.” <em>Lisenba </em>v. <em>California, </em>314 U. S. 219, 241.</p>
<p id="b213-4">In determining these issues of fact, respect for the sovereign character of the several States always has constrained this Court to give great weight to findings of fact of state courts. While we have sometimes gone back of state court determinations to make sure whether the guaranties of the Fourteenth Amendment have or have not been violated, in close cases the decisions of state courts have often been sufficient to tip the scales in favor of affirmance. <em>Lisenba </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>238, 239; <em>Buchalter </em>v. <em>New York, </em>319 U. S. 427, 431; cf. <em>Milk Wagon Drivers Union </em>v. <em>Meadowmoor Dairies, </em>312 U. S. 287, 294.</p>
<p id="b213-5">As we read the present decision the Court in effect declines to apply these well-established principles. Instead, it: (1) substitutes for determination on conflicting evidence the question whether this confession was actually produced by coercion, a presumption that it was, on a new doctrine that examination in custody of this duration is “inherently coercive”; (2) it makes that presumption irre-buttable — i. e., a rule of law — because, while it goes back of the state decisions to find certain facts, it refuses to resolve conflicts in evidence to determine whether other of <page-number citation-index="1" label="158">*158</page-number>the State’s proof is sufficient to overcome such presumption; and, in so doing, (3) it sets aside the findings by the courts of Tennessee that on all the facts this confession did not result from coercion, either giving those findings no weight or regarding them as immaterial.</p>
<p id="b214-6">We must bear in mind that this case does not come here from a lower federal court over whose conduct we may assert a general supervisory power. If it did, we should be at liberty to apply rules as to the admissibility of confessions, based on our own conception of permissible procedure, and in which we may embody restrictions even greater than those imposed upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Bram </em>v. <em>United States, </em>168 U. S. 532; <em>Wan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>266 U. S. 1; <em>McNabb </em>v. <em>United States, </em>318 U. S. 332, 341; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>322 U. S. 65. But we have no such supervisory power over state courts. We may not lay down rules of evidence for them nor revise their decisions merely because we feel more confidence in our own wisdom and rectitude. We have no power to discipline the police or law-enforcement officers of the State of Tennessee nor to reverse its convictions in retribution for conduct which we may personally disapprove.</p>
<p id="b214-7">The burden of protecting society from most crimes against persons and property falls upon the State. Different States have different crime problems and some freedom to vary procedures according to their own ideas. Here, a State was forced by an unwitnessed and baffling murder to vindicate its law and protect its society. To nullify its conviction in this particular case upon a consideration of all the facts would be a delicate exercise of federal judicial power. But to go beyond this, as the Court does today, and divine in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment an exclusion of confessions on an irrebuttable presumption that custody and examination are “inherently coercive” if of some unspecified duration within <page-number citation-index="1" label="159">*159</page-number>thirty-six hours, requires us to make more than a passing expression of our doubts and disagreements.</p>
<p id="b215-6">I.</p>
<p id="b215-7">The claim of a suspect to immunity from questioning creates one of the most vexing problems in criminal law — that branch of the law which does the courts and the legal profession least credit. The consequences upon society of limiting examination of persons out of court cannot fairly be appraised without recognition of the advantage criminals already enjoy in immunity from compulsory examination in court. Of this latter Mr. Justice Cardozo, for an all but unanimous Court, said: “This too might be lost, and justice still be done. Indeed, today as in the past there are students of our penal system who look upon the immunity as a mischief rather than a benefit, and who would limit its scope, or destroy it altogether. No doubt there would remain the need to give protection against torture, physical or mental.” <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U. S. 319, 325-26.</p>
<p id="b215-8">This Court never yet has held that the Constitution denies a State the right to use a confession just because the confessor was questioned in custody where it did not also find other circumstances that deprived him of a “free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer.” <em>Lisenba </em>v. <em>California, </em>314 U. S. 219, 241. The Constitution requires that a conviction rest on a fair trial. Forced confessions are ruled out of a fair trial. They are ruled out because they have been wrung from a prisoner by measures which are offensive to concepts of fundamental fairness. Different courts have used different terms to express the test by which to judge the inadmissibility of a confession, such as “forced,” “coerced,” “involuntary,” “extorted,” “loss of freedom of will.” But always where we have professed to speak with the voice of the due process clause, the test, in whatever words stated, has been <page-number citation-index="1" label="160">*160</page-number>applied to the particular confessor at the time' of confession.</p>
<p id="b216-4">It is for this reason that American courts hold almost universally and very properly that a confession obtained during or shortly after the confessor has been subjected to brutality, torture, beating, starvation, or physical pain of any kind is <em>prima facie </em>“involuntary.” The effect of threats alone may depend more on individual susceptibility to fear. But men are so constituted that many will risk the postponed consequences of yielding to a demand for a confession in order to be rid of present or imminent physical suffering. Actual or threatened violence have no place in eliciting truth and it is fair to assume that no officer of the law will resort to cruelty if truth is what he is seeking. We need not be too exacting about proof of the effects of such violence on the individual involved, for their effect on the human personality is invariably and seriously demoralizing.</p>
<p id="b216-5">When, however, we consider a confession obtained by questioning, even if persistent and prolonged, we are in a different field. Interrogation <em>per se </em>is not, while violence <em>per se </em>is, an outlaw. Questioning is an indispensable instrumentality of justice. It may be abused, of course, as cross-examination in court may be abused, but the principles by which we may adjudge when it passes constitutional limits are quite different from those that condemn police brutality, and are far more difficult to apply. And they call for a more responsible and cautious exercise of our office. For we may err on the side of hostility to violence without doing injury to legitimate prosecution of crime; we cannot read an undiscriminating hostility to mere interrogation into the Constitution without unduly fettering the States in protecting society from the criminal.</p>
<p id="b216-6">It probably is the normal instinct to deny and conceal any shameful or guilty act. Even a “voluntary confes<page-number citation-index="1" label="161">*161</page-number>sion” is not likely to be the product of the same motives with which one may volunteer information that does not incriminate or concern him. The term “voluntary” confession does not mean voluntary in the sense of a confession to a priest merely to rid one’s soul of a sense of guilt. “Voluntary confessions” in criminal law are the product of calculations of a different order, and usually proceed from a belief that further denial is useless and perhaps prejudicial. To speak of any confessions of crime made after arrest as being “voluntary” or “uncoerced” is somewhat inaccurate, although traditional.</p>
<p id="b217-6">A confession is wholly and incontestably voluntary only if a guilty person gives himself up to the law and becomes his own accuser. The Court bases its decision on the premise that custody and examination of a prisoner for thirty-six hours is “inherently coercive.” Of course it is. And so is custody and examination for one hour. Arrest itself is inherently coercive, and so js detention. When not justified, infliction of such indignities upon the person is actionable as a tort. Of course such acts put pressure upon the prisoner to answer questions, to answer them truthfully, and to confess if guilty.</p>
<p id="b217-7">But does the Constitution prohibit use of all confessions made after arrest because questioning, while one is deprived of freedom, is “inherently coercive”? The Court does not quite say so, but it is moving far and fast in that direction. The step it now takes is to hold this confession inadmissible because of the time taken in getting it.</p>
<p id="b217-8">The duration and intensity of an examination or Inquisition always have been regarded as one of the relevant and important considerations in estimating its effect on the will of the individual involved. Thirty-six hours is a long stretch of questioning. That the inquiry was prolonged and persistent is a factor that in any calculation <page-number citation-index="1" label="162">*162</page-number>of its effect on Ashcraft would count heavily against the confession. But some men would withstand for days pressures that would destroy the will of another in hours. Always heretofore the ultimate question has been whether the confessor was in possession of his own will and self-control at the time of confession. For its bearing on this question the Court always has considered the confessor’s strength or weakness, whether he was educated or illiterate, intelligent or moronic, well or ill, Negro or white.</p>
<p id="b218-6">But the Court refuses in this case to be guided by this test. It rejects the finding of the Tennessee courts and says it must make an “independent examination” of the circumstances. Then it says that it will not “resolve any of the disputed questions of fact” relating to the circumstances of the confession. Instead of finding as a fact that Ashcraft’s freedom of will was impaired, it substitutes the doctrine that the situation was “inherently coercive.” It thus reaches on a <em>part </em>of the evidence in the case a conclusion which I shall demonstrate it could not properly reach on <em>all </em>the evidence. And it refuses to resolve the conflicts in the other evidence to determine whether it rebuts the presumption thus reached that the confession is a coerced one.</p>
<p id="b218-7">If the constitutional admissibility of a confession is no longer to be measured by the mental state of the individual confessor but by a general doctrine dependent on the clock, it should be capable of statement in definite terms. If thirty-six hours is more than is permissible, what about 24? or 12? or 6? or 1? All are “inherently coercive.” Of course questions of law like this often turn on matters of degree. But are not the States entitled to know, jf this Court is able to state, what the considerations are which make any particular degree decisive? How else may state courts apply our tests?</p>
<p id="b219-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="163">*163</page-number>The importance of defining these new constitutional standards of admissibility of confessions is emphasized by the decision to return the companion case of Ware to the Supreme Court of Tennessee for reconsideration “in the light of our ruling as to Ashcraft.” Except for Ware’s own testimony, all of the evidence is that when he confronted Ashcraft in custody Ware confessed immediately, voluntarily, and almost spontaneously. But he had been arrested, taken from bed into custody, and detained and questioned. Does the doctrine of inherent coerciveness condemn the Ware confession? Should the Tennessee court decide whether Ware, obviously a much weaker character than Ashcraft, was <em>actually </em>coerced into confessing? It already has decided that question and this Court does not hold the fact determined wrongly. Ware’s case is properly in this Court. Why should not this Court decide Ware’s case on the merits and thus test and expound its novel ruling as applied to a different set of circumstances?</p>
<p id="b219-4">No one can regard the rule of exclusion dependent on the state of the individual’s will as an easy one to apply. It leads to controversy, speculation, and variations in application. To eliminate these evils by eliminating all confessions made after interrogation while in custody is a drastic alternative, but it is the logical consequence of today’s ruling, as its application to the facts of Ashcraft’s case will show.</p>
<p id="b219-5">II.</p>
<p id="b219-6">Apart from Ashcraft’s uncorroborated testimony, which the Tennessee courts refused to believe, there is much evidence in this record from persons whom they did believe and were justified in believing. This evidence shows that despite the “inherent coerciveness” of the circumstances of his examination, the confession when made was delib<page-number citation-index="1" label="164">*164</page-number>erate, free, and voluntary in the sense in -which that term is used in criminal law. This Court could not, in our opinion, hold this confession an involuntary one except by substituting its presumption in place of analysis of the evidence and refusing to weigh the evidence even in rebuttal of its presumption.</p>
<p id="b220-5">As in most such cases, we start with some admitted facts. In the early morning Mrs. Ashcraft left her home in an automobile to visit relatives. She was found murdered. She had not been robbed nor ravished, although an effort had been made to give the crime an appearance of robbery. The officers knew of no other motive for the killing and naturally turned to her husband for information.</p>
<p id="b220-6">On the afternoon of the crime, Thursday, June 5, 1941, they took Ashcraft to the morgue to identify the body, and to the county jail, where he was kept and interviewed until 2:00 a. m. He makes no complaint of his treatment at this time. In this and several later interviews he made a number of statements with reference to the condition of the car, and as to Mrs. Ashcraft’s having taken a certain drug, and as to money which she was accustomed to carry on her person, which further investigation indicated to be untrue. Still Ashcraft was not arrested. He professed to be willing to assist in identifying the killer. At last, on Saturday evening, June 14, an officer brought Ashcraft to the jail for further questioning. He was taken to a room on the fifth floor and questioned intermittently by several officers over a period of about thirty-six hours.</p>
<p id="b220-7">There are two versions as to what happened during this period of questioning. According to the version of the officers, which was accepted by the court which saw the witnesses, what happened? On Saturday evening Ash-craft was taken to the jail, where he was questioned by Mr. Becker and Mr. Battle. Becker is in the Intelligence <page-number citation-index="1" label="165">*165</page-number>Service of the United States Army at the present time and before that was in charge of the Homicide Bureau of the Sheriff’s office of Shelby County, Tennessee. Battle has for eight years been an Assistant Attorney General of the County. They began questioning Ashcraft about 7:00 p. m. They recounted various statements of his which had proved untrue. About 11:00 o’clock Ashcraft said he realized the circumstances all pointed to him and that he could not explain the circumstances. They then accused him of the murder, but he denied it. About 3:00 á. m. Becker and Battle retired and left Ashcraft in charge of Ezzell, a special investigator connected with the Attorney General’s office. He questioned Ashcraft and discussed the crime with him until about 7:00 on Sunday morning. Becker and Battle then returned and interviewed him intermittently until about noon, when Ezzell returned and remained until about 5:00. Becker then returned, and about 11:00 o’clock Sunday night Ashcraft expressed a desire to talk with Ezzell. Ezzell was sent for and Ashcraft told him he wanted to tell him the truth. He said, “Mr. Ezzell, a Negro killed my wife.” Ezzell asked the Negro’s name, and Ashcraft said, “Tom Ware.” Up to this time Ware had not been suspected, nor had his name been mentioned. Ashcraft explained that he did not tell the officers before because “I was scared; the Negro said he would burn my house down if I told the law.”</p>
<p id="b221-6">Thereupon Becker, Battle, Ezzell, and Mr. Jayroe, connected with the Sheriff’s office, took Ashcraft in a car and found Ware. When questioned at the jail, Ware turned to Ashcraft and said in substance that he had told Ash-craft when this thing happened that he did not intend to take the entire blame. The officers thereupon turned their attention to Ware. He promptly admitted the killing and said Ashcraft hired him to do it. Waldauer, the court reporter, was called to take down this confession, and <page-number citation-index="1" label="166">*166</page-number>completed his transcript at about 5:40 a. m. He read it to Ware and told him he did not have to sign it unless he so chose. Ware made his mark upon it and swore to it before Waldauer as a Notary Public. A copy was given to Ashcraft, and he then admitted that he had hired Ware to kill his wife. He was given breakfast and then in response to questions made a statement which was taken down by the court reporter, Waldauer. It was transcribed, but Ashcraft declined to sign it, saying that he wanted his lawyer to see it before he signed it. No effort was made to compel him to sign the confession. However, two business men of Memphis, Mr. Castle, vice president of a bank, and Mr. Pidgeon, president of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, were called in. Both testified that Ashcraft in their presence asserted that the transcript was correct but that he declined to sign it. The officers also called Dr. McQuiston to the jail to make a physical examination of both Ashcraft and Ware. He had practiced medicine in Memphis for twenty-eight years and both Mr. and Mrs. Ashcraft had been his patients for something like five years. In the presence of this friendly doctor Ash-craft might have complained of his treatment and avowed his innocence. The doctor testified, however, that Ash-craft said he had been treated all right, that he made no complaint about his eyes, and that they were not bloodshot. The doctor made a physical examination, and says Ashcraft appeared normal. He further testified as to Ash-craft, “Well, sir, he said he had not been able to get along with his wife for some time; that her health had been bad; that he had offered her a property settlement, and that she might go her way and he his way; and he also stated that he offered this colored man, Ware, a sum of money to make away with his wife.”<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The doctor says <page-number citation-index="1" label="167">*167</page-number>that that statement was entirely voluntary. No matter what pressure had been put on Ashcraft before, the courts below could reasonably believe that he made this statement voluntarily to a man of whom he had no fear and who knew his family relations.</p>
<p id="b223-6">Ashcraft’s story of torture could only be accepted by disbelieving such credible and unimpeached contradiction. Ashcraft testified that he was refused food, and was not allowed to go to the lavatory, and was denied even a drink of water. Other testimony is that on Saturday night he was brought a sandwich and coffee about midnight; that he drank the coffee but refused the sandwich; that on Sunday morning he was given a breakfast and was fed again about noon a plate lunch consisting of meat and vegetables and coffee. Both Waldauer, the Reporter, and Dr. McQuiston testified that they saw breakfast served to Ashcraft the next morning before the statement taken down by Waldauer. Ashcraft claims he was threatened and that a cigarette was slapped out of his mouth. This is all denied.</p>
<p id="b223-7">This Court rejects the testimony of the officers and disinterested witnesses in this case that the confession was voluntary not because it lacked probative value in itself nor because the witnesses were self-contradictory or were impeached. On the contrary, it is impugned only on grounds such as that such disputes “are an inescapable consequence of secret inquisitorial practices.” We infer from this that since a prisoner’s unsupported word often conflicts with that of the officers, the officer’s testimony for constitutional purposes is always <em>prima jade </em>false. We know that police standards often leave much to be desired, but we are not ready to believe that the democratic proc<page-number citation-index="1" label="168">*168</page-number>ess brings to office men generally less believable than the average of those accused of crime.</p>
<p id="b224-6">Reference also is made to the fact that when petitioner was questioned investigation had failed “to unearth one single tangible clue pointing to his guilt.” We cannot see the relevance of such circumstances on the question of the voluntary or involuntary character of his statements to the officers. Is the suggestion that if they had probable clews to his guilt, their questioning of him would have been better justified?</p>
<p id="b224-7">This questioning is characterized as a “secret inquisition,” invoking all of the horrendous historical associations of those words. Certainly the inquiry was participated in by a good many persons, and we do not see how it could have been much less “secret” unless the press should have been called in. Of course, any questioning may be characterized as an “inquisition,” but the use of such characterizations is no substitute for the detached and judicial consideration that the court below gave to the case.</p>
<p id="b224-8">We conclude that even going behind the state court decisions into the facts, no independent judgment on the whole evidence that Ashcraft’s confession was in fact coerced is possible. And against this background of facts the extreme character of the Court’s ruling becomes apparent.</p>
<p id="b224-9">I am not sure whether the Court denies the State all right to arrest and question the husband of the slain woman. No investigation worthy of the name could fail to examine him. Of all persons, he was most likely to know whether she had enemies or rivals. Would not the State have a constitutional right, whether he was accused or not, to arrest and detain him as a material witness? If it has the right to detain one as a witness, presumably it has the right to examine him.</p>
<p id="b225-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="169">*169</page-number>Could the State not confront Ashcraft with his false statements and ask his explanation? He did not throw himself at any time on his rights, refuse to answer, and demand counsel, even according to his own testimony. The strategy of the officers evidently was to keep him talking, to give him plenty of rope and see if he would not hang himself. He does not claim to have made objection to this. Instead he relied on his wits. The time came when it dawned on him that his own story brought him under suspicion, and that he could not meet it. Must the officers stop at this point because he was coming to appreciate the uselessness of deception?</p>
<p id="b225-4">Then he became desperate and accused the Negro. Certainly from this point the State was justified in holding and questioning him as a witness, for he claimed to know the killer. That accusation backfired and only turned up a witness against him. He had run out of expedients and inventions; he knew he had lost the battle of wits. After all, honesty seemed to be the best, even if the last, policy. He confessed in detail.</p>
<p id="b225-5">At what point in all this investigation does the Court hold that the Constitution commands these officers to send Ashcraft on his way and give up the murder as insoluble ? If the State is denied the right to apply any pressure to him which is “inherently coercive” it could hardly deprive him of his freedom at all. I, too, dislike to think of any man, under the disadvantages and indignities of detention being questioned about his personal life for thirty-six hours or for one hour. In fact, there is much in our whole system of penology that seems archaic and vindictive and badly managed. Every person in the community, no matter how inconvenient or embarrassing, no matter what retaliation it exposes him to, may be called upon to take the witness stand and tell all he knows about a crime — except the person who knows most about it. <page-number citation-index="1" label="170">*170</page-number>Efforts of prosecutors to compensate for this handicap by violent or brutal treatment or threats we condemn as passionately and sincerely as other members of the Court. But we are not ready to say that the pressure to disclose crime, involved in decent detention and lengthy examination, although we admit them to be “inherently coercive,” are denied to a State by the Constitution, where they are not proved to have passed the individual’s ability to resist and to admit, deny, or refuse to answer.</p>
<p id="b226-6">III.</p>
<p id="b226-7">The Court either gives no weight to the findings of the Tennessee courts or it regards their inquiry as to the effect on the individuals involved as immaterial. We think it was a material inquiry and that respect is due to their conclusion.</p>
<p id="b226-8">The Supreme Court of Tennessee, writing in this case, stated the law of that State by which it reviewed and affirmed the action of the trial court. It said, “When confessions are offered as evidence, their competency becomes a preliminary question to be determined by the court. This imposes upon the presiding judge the duty of deciding <em>the fact </em>whether the party making the confession was influenced by hope or fear. This rule is so well established, that if the judge allow the jury to determine the preliminary fact, it is error, for which the judgment will be reversed.</p>
<p id="b226-9">“In the instant case the trial judge heard the witnesses as to their confessions out of the presence of the jury, and he held that under the facts he could not say that the confessions were not voluntarily made and, therefore, permitted them to go to the jury.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p id="b226-10">The rule of law thus laid down complied with the law as this Court had settled it at the time of trial.</p>
<p id="b226-11">The Tennessee Supreme Court made a painstaking examination of the evidence in the light of the claim that <page-number citation-index="1" label="171">*171</page-number>the confessions were coerced. It concluded that it was “unable to say that the confessions were not freely and voluntarily made. Both of the plaintiffs in error have had a fair trial and we decline to disturb the conviction.”</p>
<p id="b227-6">That court, it is clear, renders no mere lip service to the guaranties of the Constitution. In other cases it has set aside convictions because confessions used at trials were found to have been coerced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is not the least indication that the court was passionate or biased or that the result does not represent the honest judgment of a high-minded court, sensitive to these problems.</p>
<p id="b227-7">A trial judge out of hearing of the jury saw and heard Ashcraft and saw and heard those whom Ashcraft accused of coercing him. In determining a matter of this kind no one can deny the great advantage of a court which may see and hear a man who claims that h,is will succumbed and those who, it is claimed, were so overbearing. The real issue is strength of character, and a few minutes’ observation of the parties in the courtroom is more informing than reams of cold record. There is not the slightest indication that the trial judge was prejudiced or indifferent to the prisoner’s rights. Ashcraft’s counsel moved to exclude his confession “for the reason that the statements contained therein were not freely and voluntarily made, nor were they free from duress and restraint, but were secured by compulsion. . . .” The court said, “. . . the sole proposition, as the Court sees it from this testimony, is that he was confined and questioned for a period of approximately thirty-six hours. I think counsel concedes that is practically the main ground upon which he rests his motion. There was no physical violence offered to the defendant Ashcraft, and none claimed.” He overruled the motion and received the confession. This <page-number citation-index="1" label="172">*172</page-number>Court, not one of whose members ever saw Ashcraft or any one of the State’s witnesses, overturns the decision by the trial judge.</p>
<p id="b228-5">Moreover, a jury held Ashcraft’s statements incredible. After the trial judge, out of their presence, heard the evidence and decided the confession was admissible, the jury heard the evidence to decide whether the confession should be believed. Ashcraft again testified and so did all of the witnesses for the State. Conduct of the hearing both by the judge and the prosecutors was above criticism. The Court observes: “If, therefore, the question of the voluntariness of the two confessions was actually decided at all it was by the jury.” Is it suggested that a State consistently with the Constitution may not leave this question to the sole determination of a jury? I had supposed that the constitutional duty of a State when such questions of fact arise is to furnish due process of law for deciding them. Does not jury trial meet this test? Here Tennessee, and I think very commendably, provided the double safeguards of a preliminary trial by the judge and a final determination by the jury.</p>
<p id="b228-6">The Court’s opinion makes a critical reference to the charge of the trial judge. However, diligent counsel took no exception to the part of the charge quoted, made no request for further instruction on the subject, and assigned no error to the charge. Even if we think the charge inadequate, does the inadequacy of a charge constitute want of due process? And if so, do we review questions as to the charge although counsel for the petitioner made no objection during the trial when the judge could have corrected the error, but after the trial was over assigned it as one of twelve reasons for demanding a new trial?</p>
<p id="b228-7">No conclusion that this confession was actually coerced can be reached on this record except by reliance upon the utterly uncorroborated statements of defendant Ashcraft. <page-number citation-index="1" label="173">*173</page-number>His testimony does not carry even ordinary guaranties of truthfulness, and the courts and jury were not bound to accept it. Perjury is a light offense compared to murder and they may well have believed that Ashcraft was ready to resort to a lesser crime to avoid conviction of a greater one. Furthermore, the very grounds on which this Court now upsets his conviction Ashcraft repudiated at the trial. He asserts that he was abused, but he does not testify as this Court holds that it had the effect of forcing an involuntary confession from him. On the contrary, he flatly insists that it had no such effect and that he never did confess at all.</p>
<p id="b229-4">Against Ashcraft’s word the state courts and jury accepted the testimony of several apparently disinterested witnesses of high standing in their communities, in addition to that of the accused officers. One of the witnesses to Ashcraft’s admission of guilt was his own family physician, two were disinterested businessmen of substance and standing, another was an experienced court reporter who had long held this position of considerable trust. Another was a member of the bar. Certainly, the state courts were not committing an offense against the Constitution of the United States in refusing to believe that this whole group of apparently reputable citizens entered into a conspiracy to swear a murder onto an innocent man, against whom not one of them is shown to have had a grievance or a grudge.</p>
<p id="b229-5">This is not the case of an ignorant and unrepresented defendant who has been the victim of prejudice. Ashcraft was a white man of good reputation, good position, and substantial property. For a week after this crime was discovered he was not detained, although his stories to the officers did not hang together, but was at large, free to consult his friends and counsel.
