 Petitioner, a layman, was undoubtedly unaware that under Illinois law an admission of “mere” complicity in the murder plot was legally as damaging as an admission of firing of the fatal shots.  Illinois v. Escobedo, 28 Ill. 2d 41 , 190 N. E. 2d 825 .  The “guiding hand of counsel” was essential to advise petitioner of his rights in this delicate situation.  Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 69 .  This was the “stage when legal aid and advice” were most critical to petitioner.  Massiah v. United States, supra, at 204.  It was a stage surely as critical as was the arraignment in Hamilton v. Alabama, <citedDecision>368 U. S. 52</citedDecision> , and the preliminary hearing in White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 .  What happened at this interrogation could certainly “affect the whole trial,” <citedDecision>Hamilton</citedDecision> v. Alabama, supra, at 54, since rights “may be as irretrievably lost, if not then and there asserted, as they are when an accused represented by counsel waives a right for strategic purposes.” Ibid. It would exalt form over substance to make the right to counsel, under these circumstances, depend on whether at the time of the interrogation, the ¿uthorities had secured a formal indictment.  Petitioner had, for all practical purposes, already been charged with murder.  The New York Court of Appeals, whose decisions this Court cited with approval in Massiah, 377 U. S. 201, at 205 , has recently recognized that, under circumstances such as those here, no meaningful distinction can be drawn between interrogation of an accused before and after formal indictment.  In People v. Donovan, 13 N. Y. 2d 148, 193 N. E. 2d 628 , that court, in an opinion by Judge Fuld, held that a “confession taken from a defendant, during a period of detention [prior to indictment], after his attorney had requested and been denied access *487 to him” could not be used against him in a criminal trial. 6 Id., at 151, 193 N. E. 2d, at 629 .  The court observed that it “would be highly incongruous if our system of justice permitted the district attorney, the lawyer representing the State, to extract a confession from the accused while his own lawyer, seeking to speak with him, was kept from him by the police.” Id., at 152, 193 N. E. 2d, at 629 .  7 In Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 , we held that every person accused of a crime, whether state or federal, is entitled to a lawyer at trial. 8 The rule sought by the State here, however, would make the trial no more than an appeal from the interrogation; and the “right to use counsel at the formal trial [would be] a very hollow thing [if], for all practical purposes, the conviction is already assured by pretrial examination.” In re Groban, 352 U. S. *488 330, 344 (Black, J., dissenting).  9 “One can imagine a cynical prosecutor saying: 'Let them have the most illustrious counsel, now.  They can’t escape the noose.  There is nothing that counsel can do for them at the trial.’ ” Ex parte Sullivan, 107 F. Supp. 514, 517-518 .  It is argued that if the right to counsel is afforded prior to indictment, the number of confessions obtained by the police will diminish significantly, because most confessions are obtained during the period between arrest and indictment, 10 and “any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under any circumstances.” Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 59 (Jackson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  This argument, of course, cuts two ways.  The fact that many confessions are obtained during this period points up its critical nature as a “stage when legal aid and advice” are surely needed.  Massiah v. United States, supra, at 204; <citedDecision>Hamilton</citedDecision> v. Alabama, supra; White v. Maryland, supra. The right to counsel would indeed be hollow if it began at a period when few confessions were obtained.  There is necessarily a direct relationship between the importance of a stage to the police in their quest for a confession and the criticalness of that stage to the accused in his need for legal advice.  Our Constitution, unlike some others, strikes the balance in favor of the right of the accused to be advised by his lawyer of his privilege against self-incrimination.  See Note, 73 Yale L. J. 1000, 1048-1051 (1964).  We have learned the lesson of history, ancient and modern, that a system of criminal law enforcement *489 which comes to depend on the “confession” will, in the long run, be less reliable 11 and more subject to abuses 12 than a system, which depends on extrinsic evidence independently secured through skillful investigation.  As Dean Wigmore so wisely said: “[A]ny system of administration which permits the prosecution to trust habitually to compulsory self-disclosure as a source of proof must itself suffer morally thereby.  The inclination develops to rely mainly upon such evidence, and to be satisfied with an incomplete investigation of the other sources.

 .  .  Persons [denied access to counsel] are incapable of providing the challenges that are indispensable to satisfactory operation of the system.  The loss to the interests of accused, individuals, occasioned by these failures, are great and apparent.  It' is also clear that a situation in which persons are required to contest a serious accusation but are denied access to the tools of contest is offensive to fairness and equity.  Beyond these considerations, however, is the fact that [this situation is] detrimental to the proper functioning of the system of justice and that the loss in vitality of the adversary system, thereby occasioned, significantly endangers the basic interests of a free community.” The accused may, of course, intelligently and knowingly waive his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel either at a pretrial stage or at the trial. See Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 .  But no knowing and intelligent waiver of any constitutional right can be said to have occurred under the circumstances of this case. The authority of Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , and Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 , was weakened by the subsequent decisions of this Court in Hamilton v. Alabama, <citedDecision>368 U. S. 52</citedDecision> , White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 , and Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 (as the dissenting opinion in the last-cited case recognized).
