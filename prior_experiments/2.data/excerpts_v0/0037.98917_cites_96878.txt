Passage 1:
ave been aptly likened to the description in a deed, which sets the bounds to the grant which it contains. It is to the claims of every patent, therefore, that we must turn when we are seeking to determine what the invention is, the exclusive use of which is given to the inventor by the grant provided for by the statute, ย "He can claim nothing beyond them." Keystone Bridge Co. v. Phoenix Iron Co., 95 U.S. 274; Railroad Co. v. Mellon, 104 U.S. 112, 118; Yale Lock Mfg. Co. v. Greenleaf, 117 U.S. 554, 559; McClain v. Ortmayer, 141 U.S. 419, 424.
2nd. It has long been settled that the patentee receives nothing from the law which he did not have before, and that the only effect of his patent is to restrain others from manufacturing, using or selling that which he has invented. The patent law simply protects him in the monopoly of that which he has invented and has described in the claims of his patent. United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 167 U.S. 224, 239; Paper Bag Patent Case, <targetCase>210 U.S. 405</targetCase>, 424; Bauer v. O'Donnell, 229 U.S. 1, 10.
3rd. Since Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1, was decided in *511 1829 this court has consistently held that the primary purpose of our patent laws is not the creation of private fortunes for the owners of patents but is "to promote the progress of science and useful arts" (Constitution, Art. I, ยง 8), an object and purpose authoritatively expressed by Mr. Justice Story, in that decision, saying:
"While one great object [of our patent laws] was, by holding out a reasonable reward to inventors, and giving them an exclusive right to their inventions for a limited period, to stimulate the efforts of genius; the main object was `to promote the progress of science and useful arts.'"
Thirty years later this court, returning to the subject, in Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, again pointedly and significantly says:
"It is undeniably true, that the limited and temporary monopoly granted to inventors was never designed for their exclusive profit or advantage
Passage 2:
tial power for evil over an industry which must be recognized as an important element in the amusement life of the nation, under the conclusions we have stated in this opinion, is plainly void, because wholly without the scope and purpose of our patent laws and because, if sustained, it would be gravely injurious to that public interest, which we have seen is more a favorite of the law than is the promotion of private fortunes.
Both questions as stated must be answered in the negative and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS concurs in the result.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES, dissenting.
I suppose that a patentee has no less property in his patented machine than any other owner, and that in addition to keeping the machine to himself the patent gives him the further right to forbid the rest of the world from making others like it. In short, for whatever motive, he may keep his device wholly out of use. Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., <targetCase>210 U.S. 405</targetCase>, 422. So much being undisputed, I cannot understand why he may not keep it out of use unless the licensee, or, for the matter of that, the buyer, will use some unpatented thing in connection with it. Generally speaking the measure of a condition is the consequence of a breach, and if that consequence is one that the owner may impose unconditionally, he may impose it conditionally upon a certain event. Ashley v. Ryan, 153 U.S. 436, 443. Lloyd v. Dollison, 194 U.S. 445, 449. Non debet, cui plus licet, quod minus est non licere. D. 50, 17, 21.
*520 No doubt this principle might be limited or excluded in cases where the condition tends to bring about a state of things that there is a predominant public interest to prevent. But there is no predominant public interest to prevent a patented tea pot or film feeder from being kept from the public, because, as I have said, the patentee may keep them tied up at will while his patent lasts. Neither is there any such interest to prevent the purcha
