 The Perez automobile was not covered by liability insurance at the time of the collision.  The driver of the second ca,r was the minor daughter of Leonard Pinkerton, and in September 1966 the Pinkertons sued Mr. and Mrs. Perez in state court for personal injuries and property damage sustained in the accident.  On October 31, 1967, the petitioners confessed judgment in this suit, and a judgment order was entered against them on November 8, 1967, for $2,425.98 plus court costs.  Mr. and Mrs. Perez each filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in Federal District Court on November 6, 1967.  Each of them duly scheduled the judgment debt *639 to the Pinkertons.  The District Court entered orders on July 8, 1968, discharging both Mr. and Mrs. Perez from all debts and claims provable against their estates, including the Pinkerton judgment.  11 U. S. C. §35 ; Lewis v. Roberts, <citedDecision>267 U. S. 467</citedDecision> (1925).  During the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, the provisions of the Arizona Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act came into play.  Although only one provision of the Arizona Act is relevant to the issue presented by this case, it is appropriate to describe the statutory scheme in some detail.  The Arizona statute is based on the Uniform Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act promulgated by the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety.  1 Articles 1 and 2 of the Act deal, respectively, with definitional matters and administration.  The substantive provisions begin in Art. 3, which requires the posting of financial security by those involved in accidents.  Section 28-1141 of that article requires suspension of licenses for unlawful failure to report accidents, and § 28-1142 (Supp. 1970-1971) provides that within 60 days of the receipt of an accident report the Superintendent of the Motor Vehicle Division of the Highway Department shall suspend the driver's license of the operator and the registration of the owner of a car involved in an accident “unless such operator or owner or both shall deposit security in a sum which is sufficient in the judgment of the superintendent to satisfy any judgment or judgments for damages resulting from the accident as may be recovered against the operator or owner.” Under the same section, notice of such suspension and the amount of security required must be sent to the owner and operator not less than 10 days prior to the effective date of the suspension.

 See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 28-1143 (A) (4), 28-1144 (3).  Moreover, there are no provisions requiring drivers proved to' be careless to stay off the roads for a period of time.  Nor are there provisions requiring drivers who have caused accidents to attend some kind of driver improvement course, a technique that is not unfamiliar in sentencing for traffic offenses.  Turning to the federal statute, the construction of the Bankruptcy Act is similarly clear.  This Court on numerous occasions has stated that “[o]ne of the primary purposes of the bankruptcy act” is to give debtors “a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.” Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234, 244 (1934).  Accord, e. g., Harris v. Zion’s Savings Bank & Trust Co., 317 U. S. 447, 451 (1943); Stellwagen v. Clum, 245 U. S. 605, 617 (1918); Williams v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 236 U. S. 549, 554-555 (1915).  There can be no doubt, given Lewis v. Roberts, <citedDecision>267 U. S. 467</citedDecision> (1925), that Congress intended this “new opportunity” to include freedom from most kinds of pre-existing tort judgments.  *649 II With the construction of both statutes clearly established, we proceed immediately to the constitutional question whether a state statute that protects judgment creditors from “financially irresponsible persons” is in conflict with a federal statute that gives discharged debtors a new start “unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.” As early as Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall stated the governing principle — that “acts of the State Legislatures .  .  .  [which] interfere with, or are contrary to the laws of Congress, made in pursuance of the constitution,” are invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  Id., at 211 (emphasis added).  Three decades ago Mr. Justice Black, after reviewing the precedents, wrote in a similar vein that, while “[t]his Court, in considering the validity of state laws in the light of treaties or federal laws touching the same subject, ha[d] made use of the following expressions: conflicting; contrary to; occupying the field; repugnance; difference; irreconcilability; inconsistency; violation; curtailment; and interference[,] .

 In light of our decision today, the sum of the argument is to draw into question the constitutional validity of the District's anti-discharge section, for as noted in the dissent the Constitution confers upon Congress the power “[t]o establish .  .  .  uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.” U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 4 (emphasis *655 added).  It is asserted that “Congress must have regarded the two statutes as consistent and compatible/’ post, at 665, but such an argument assumes a modicum of legislative attention to the question of consistency.  The D. C. Code section does, of course, refer specifically to discharges, but its passage may at most be viewed as evidencing an opinion of Congress on the meaning of the general discharge provision enacted by an earlier Congress and interpreted by this Court as early as 1925.  See <citedDecision>Lewis</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Roberts, supra.</citedDecision> In fact, in passing the initial and amended version of the District of Columbia financial responsibility law, Congress gave no attention to the interaction of the anti-discharge section with the Bankruptcy Act.  15 Moreover, the legislative history is *656 quite clear that when Congress dealt with the subject of financial responsibility laws for the District, it based its work upon the efforts of the uniform commissioners which had won enactment in other States.  16 Had Congress focused on the interaction between this minor subsection of the rather lengthy financial responsibility act and the discharge provision of the Bankruptcy Act, it would have been immediately apparent to the legislators that the only constitutional method for so defining the scope and effect of a discharge in bankruptcy was by amendment of the Bankruptcy Act, which by its terms is a uniform statute applicable in the States, Territories, and the District of Columbia.  11 U. S. C. § 1 (29).  To follow any other course would obviously be to legislate in such a way that a discharge in bankruptcy means one thing in the District of Columbia and something else in the States — depending on state law — a result explicitly prohibited by the uniformity requirement in the constitutional authorization to Congress to enact bankruptcy legislation.  V From the foregoing, we think it clear that § 28-1163 (B) of the Arizona Safety Responsibility Act is constitutionally invalid.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 I would adhere to the rulings and I would hold that the States have an appropriate and legitimate concern with highway safety; that the means Arizona has adopted with respect to one in Adolfo’s position (that is, the driver whose negligence has caused harm to others and whose judgment debt based on that negligence remains unsatisfied) in its attempt to assure driving competence and care on the part of its licensees, as well as to protect others, is appropriate state legislation; and that the Arizona statute, like its Utah counterpart, despite the tangential effect upon bankruptcy, does not operate in derogation of the Bankruptcy Act or conflict with it to the extent it may rightly be said to violate the Supremacy Clause.  Other factors of significance are also to be noted: 1.  The Court struggles to explain away the parallel District of Columbia situation installed by Congress itself.  Section 40-464 of the D. C. Code Ann. (1967) in all pertinent parts is identical with Arizona’s § 28-1163 (B).  The only difference is in the final word, namely, “article” in the Arizona statute and “chapter” in the District’s.  The District of Columbia statute was enacted as § 48 of Pub. Law 365 of May 25, 1954, effective one year later, 68 Stat. 132 .  This is long after the Bankruptcy Act *665 was placed on the books and, indeed, long after this Court’s decision in Lewis v. Roberts, <citedDecision>267 U. S. 467</citedDecision> (1925), that a personal injury judgment is a provable claim in bankruptcy.  Surely, as the Court noted in Kesler, 369 U. S., at 173-174 , “Congress had no thought of amending the Bankruptcy Act when it adopted this law for the District of Columbia.” See Lee v. England, 206 F. Supp. 957 (DC 1962).  Congress must have regarded the two statutes as consistent and compatible, and cannot have thought otherwise for the last 35 years.  5 If the statutes truly are in tension, then I would suppose that the later one, that is, § 40-464, would be the one to prevail.  Gibson v. United States, 194 U. S. 182, 192 (1904).  But, if so, we then have something less than the “uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States” that Art. I, § 8, cl. 4, of the Constitution commands, for the law would be one way in Arizona (and, by the present overruling of Reitz and Kesler , in New York and in Utah) and the other way in the District of Columbia.  Unfortunately, such is the dilemma in which the Court’s decision today leaves us.
