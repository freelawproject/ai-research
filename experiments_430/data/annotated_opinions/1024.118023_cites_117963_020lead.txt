 However, when a State entirely prohibits the dissemination of truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of a fair bargaining process, there is far less reason to depart from the rigorous review that the First Amendment generally demands.  Sound reasons justify reviewing the latter type of commercial speech regulation more carefully.  Most obviously, complete speech bans, unlike content-neutral restrictions on the time, place, or manner of expression, see Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 89 (1949), are particularly dangerous because they all but foreclose alternative means of disseminating certain information.  Our commercial speech cases have recognized the dangers that attend governmental attempts to single out certain messages for suppression.  For example, in Linmark, 431 U. S., at 92-94 , we concluded that a ban on “For Sale” signs *502 was “content based” and failed to leave open “satisfactory” alternative channels of communication; see also Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 771 .  Moreover, last Term we upheld a 30-day prohibition against a certain form of legal solicitation largely because it left so many channels of communication open to Florida lawyers.  Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., <citedDecision>515 U. S. 618, 633-634</citedDecision> (1995).  11 The special dangers that attend complete bans on truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech cannot be explained away by appeals to the “commonsense distinctions” that exist between commercial and noncommercial speech.  Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 771, n. 24 .  Regulations that suppress the truth are no less troubling because they target objectively verifiable information, nor are they less effective because they aim at durable messages.  As a result, neither the “greater objectivity” nor the “greater hardiness” of truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech justifies reviewing its complete suppression with added deference.  Ibid. It is the State’s interest in protecting consumers from “commercial harms” that provides “the typical reason why commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial speech.” Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 426 (1993).  Yet bans *503 that target truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages rarely protect consumers from such harms.

 They expressed “doubt whether suppression of information concerning the availability and price of a legally offered product is ever a permissible way for the State to ‘dampen’ the demand for or use of the product.” Id., at 574 .  Indeed, Justice Blackmun believed that even *501 “though ‘commercial’ speech is involved, such a regulation strikes at the heart of the First Amendment.” Ibid. “Florida permits lawyers to advertise on prime-time television and radio as well as in newspapers and other media.  They may rent space on billboards.  They may send untargeted letters to the general population, or to discrete segments thereof.  There are, of course, pages upon pages devoted to lawyers in the Yellow Pages of Florida telephone directories.  These listings are organized alphabetically and by area of specialty.  See generally Rule 4-7.2(a), Rules Regulating The Florida Bar (‘[A] lawyer may advertise services through public media, such as a telephone directory, legal directory, newspaper or other periodical, billboards, and other signs, radio, television, and recorded messages the public may access by dialing a telephone number, or through written communication not involving solicitation as defined in rule 4-7.4’); The Florida Bar: Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating The Florida Bar — Advertising Issues, 571 So. 2d, at 461.” <citedDecision>515 U. S., at 633-634</citedDecision> .  In Discovery Network, we held that the city’s categorical ban on commercial newsracks attached too much importance to the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech.  After concluding that the esthetic and safety interests served by the newsrack ban bore no relationship whatsoever to the prevention of commercial harms, we rejected the State’s attempt to justify its ban on the sole ground that it targeted commercial speech.  See 507 U. S., at 428.  This case bears out the point.  Rhode Island seeks to reduce alcohol consumption by increasing alcohol price; yet its means of achieving that goal deprives the public of their chief source of information about the reigning price level of alcohol.  As a result, the State’s price advertising ban keeps the public ignorant of the key barometer of the ban’s effectiveness: the alcohol beverages’ prices.
