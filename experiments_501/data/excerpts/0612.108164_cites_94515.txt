 Petitioner sought a rehearing, contending, as he contends here, that Brantley was no longer controlling.  He relied on Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957), and *326 United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F., 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 913 (1966).  His contention was rejected.  In deciding that Brantley was still a binding precedent as to it, the Georgia Court of Appeals noted that the Georgia Supreme Court had transferred the case to it as involving the application of only “plain and unambiguous” constitutional provisions.  The petitioner’s motion was then denied.  Thereafter the Georgia Supreme Court denied certiorari, and petitioner sought review in this Court. We granted the writ, 395 U. S. 975 (1969), and now reverse.  (1) In United States v. Ball, <citedDecision>163 U. S. 662, 669</citedDecision> (1896), this Court observed: “The Constitution of the United States, in the Fifth Amendment, declares, ‘nor shall any person be subject [for the same offense] to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.’ The prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy .  .  .  .” (Emphasis added.) The “twice put in jeopardy” language of the Constitution thus relates to a potential, i.  e., the risk that an accused for a second time will be convicted of the “same offense” for which he was initially tried.  The circumstances that give rise to such a forbidden potential have been the subject of much discussion in this Court. In the <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> case, for example, the Court expressly rejected the view that the double jeopardy provision prevented a second trial when a conviction had been set aside.  In so doing, it effectively formulated a concept of continuing jeopardy that has application where criminal proceedings against an accused have not run their full course.  See Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 189 (1957).  The continuing jeopardy principle necessarily is applicable to this case. Petitioner sought and obtained the *327 reversal of his initial conviction for voluntary manslaughter by taking an appeal.  Accordingly, no aspect of the bar on double jeopardy prevented his retrial for that crime.  However, the first verdict, limited as it was to the lesser included offense, required that the retrial be limited to that lesser offense.  Such a result flows inescapably from the Constitution’s emphasis on a risk of conviction and the Constitution’s explication in prior decisions of this Court. An early case to deal with restrictions on retrials was Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100 (1904), where the Court held that the Fifth Amendment’s double jeopardy prohibition barred the Government from appealing an acquittal in a criminal prosecution, 2 over a dissent by Mr. Justice Holmes that argued that there was only one continuing jeopardy until the proceedings against the accused had been finally resolved.

 The Court in the Green case reversed the first-degree murder conviction obtained at the retrial, holding that the petitioner’s jeopardy for first-degree murder came to an end when the jury was discharged at the end of his first trial. This conclusion rested on two premises.  First, the Court considered the first jury’s verdict of guilty on the second-degree murder charge to be an “implicit acquittal” on the charge of first-degree murder.  *329 Second, and more broadly, the Court reasoned that petitioner’s jeopardy on the greater charge had ended when the first jury “was given a full opportunity to return a verdict” on that charge and instead reached a verdict on the lesser charge.  355 U. S. at 191 .  Under either of these premises, the holding in the Kepner case — that there could be no appeal from an acquittal because such a verdict ended an accused’s jeopardy — was applicable.  The rationale of the Green holding applies here.  The concept of continuing jeopardy implicit in the <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> case 4 would allow petitioner’s retrial for voluntary manslaughter after his first conviction for that offense had been reversed.  But, as the Kepner and Green cases illustrate, this Court has consistently refused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after an acquittal, whether that acquittal is express or implied by a conviction on a lesser included offense when the jury was given a full opportunity 5 to return a verdict on the greater charge.  There is no relevant factual distinction between this case and Green v. United States.  Although the petitioner was not convicted of the greater charge on retrial, whereas Green was, the risk of conviction on the greater charge was the same in both cases, and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is written in terms of potential or risk of trial and conviction, not punishment.  The Georgia courts nonetheless rejected Green as a persuasive authority in favor of reliance on Brantley v. State, 132 Ga. 573 , 64 S. E. 676 (1909), aff’d, 217 U, S. 284 (1910).  The Brantley case presented a situation where a defendant’s appeal from a conviction for a *330 lesser included offense ultimately led to retrial and conviction on the greater offense.  After the second conviction had been affirmed on appeal,, the defendant sued out a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Georgia from this Court, contending “that the exemption from second jeopardy is one of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, which the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state to abridge”, 6 that he had “been tried and acquitted by a jury of his country of the crime of murder”, 7 and that “[h]e should never [sic] have been tried a second time only for the offense on which he obtained a new trial .

 10 Further, and perhaps of more importance, we cannot determine whether or not the murder charge against petitioner induced the jury to find him guilty of the less serious offense of voluntary manslaughter rather than to continue to debate his innocence.  See United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. *332 Wilkins, 348 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 913 (1966).  (3) We asked the parties to submit post-argument mem-oranda directed to the question of whether petitioner can now be re-indicted or retried for voluntary manslaughter under Georgia law. These memoranda have been filed and indicate that the answer to our question appears to depend upon the construction of several Georgia statutes and on the power of Georgia courts to fashion remedial orders.  Accordingly, although we reverse petitioner’s conviction, we also remand the case to enable the Georgia courts to resolve the issues pertaining to petitioner’s retrial, if any such retrial is to be had.  Reversed and remanded.  MR. Justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. 1 Georgia’s Constitution provides for direct review in the Georgia Supreme Court of, among others, “all cases that involve the construction of the Constitution of the State of Georgia or of the United States ...” Ga. Const., Art. VI, § 2, ¶ 4.  2 Keener rested upon a portion of the <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> case that dealt with a criminal action that had been finally resolved.  In <citedDecision>Ball</citedDecision> the Court had held that the Government could not re-indict an accused for an offense where a judgment of acquittal had been entered by a trial court with jurisdiction over the accused and the cause.  <citedDecision>163 U. S., at 669-670</citedDecision> .  The Court relied partially on United States v. Sanges, 144 U. S. 310 (1892), where the Court had interpreted the Judiciary Act of 1891 to hold that the United States could not obtain review by a writ of error in a criminal case. 3 Shortly after Kepner the Court was faced with a factual situation somewhat akin to that presented by the instant ease.  In Trono v. United States, 199 U. S. 521 (1905)„ the defendants had been charged in a Philippine court with murder, and had been found guilty of the lesser offense of assault.  On their appeal of *328 the conviction the Philippine Supreme Court set aside the trial court’s judgment, found them guilty of murder, and increased their sentences.  This Court affirmed.  Four Justices took the position that by appealing the assault conviction, the defendants had waived any double jeopardy claim respecting the murder charge.  Mr. Justice Holmes concurred in the result without stating his rationale.
