 The Haddock case involved a suit for separation and alimony, brought in New York by the wife on personal service of the husband.  The husband pleaded in defense a divorce decree obtained by him in Connecticut where he had established a separate domicil.  This Court held that New York, the matrimonial domicil where the wife still resided, need not give full faith and credit to the Connecticut decree, since it was obtained by the husband who wrongfully left his wife in the matrimonial domicil, service on her having been obtained by publication and she not having entered an appearance in the action.  But we do not agree with the theory of the Haddock case that, so far as the marital status of the parties is concerned, 4 a decree of divorce granted under such circumstances by one state need not be given full faith and credit in another.  Article IV, § 1 of the Constitution not only directs that “Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State” but also provides that “Congress may by general laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.” Congress has exercised that power.  By the Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 28 U. S. C. 687, Congress has provided that judgments “shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are taken.” Chief Justice Marshall stated in Hampton v. M’Connel, 3 Wheat. 234, 235 , that “the judgment of a state court should have the same credit, *294 validity, and effect, in every other court in the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced, and that whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such state, and none others, could be pleaded in any other court in the United States.” That view has survived substantially intact.  Fauntleroy v. Lum, <citedDecision>210 U. S. 230</citedDecision> .  This Court only recently stated that Art. IV, § 1 and the Act of May 26, 1790 require that “not some, but full” faith and credit be given judgments of a state court. Davis v. Davis, 306 U. S. 32 , 40.  Thus, even though the cause of action could not be entertained in the state of the forum, either because it had been barred by the local statute of limitations or contravened local policy, the judgment thereon obtained in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit.  See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290 ; <citedDecision>Fauntleroy</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Lum, supra;</citedDecision> Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 262 U. S. 411 ; Titus v. Wallick, 306 U. S. 282, 291 .  Some exceptions have been engrafted on the rule laid down by Chief Justice Marshall.  But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandéis in Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642 , “the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one.” So far as judgments are concerned, the decisions, 5 as distinguished from dicta, 6 show that the *295 actual exceptions have been few and far between, apart from Haddock v. Haddock .  For this Court has been reluctant to admit exceptions in case of judgments rendered by the courts of a sister state, since the “very purpose” of Art. IV, § 1 was “to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation.” Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, pp. 276-277.  This Court, to be sure, has recognized that in case of statutes, “the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed,” some “accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states” is necessary.  Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, 294 U. S. 532, 547 .  But that principle would come into play only in case the Nevada decrees were assailed on the ground that Nevada must give full faith and credit in its divorce proceedings to the divorce statutes of North Carolina.

 One who challenges that right, because of the force given to a conflicting statute of another state by the full faith and credit clause, assumes the burden of showing, upon some rational basis, that of the conflicting interests involved those of the foreign state are superior to those of the *296 forum.” Id., pp. 547-548.  It is difficult to perceive how North Carolina could be said to have an interest in Nevada’s domiciliaries superior to the interest of Nevada.  Nor is there any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state.  Certainly Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145 , did not so hold.  Indeed, the recent case of Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, 306 U. S. 493, 502 , held that in the case of statutes “the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of another state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the courts of the state of its enactment with respect to the same persons and events.” Moreover, Haddock v. Haddock is not based on the contrary theory.  Nor did it hold that a decree of divorce granted by the courts of one state need not be given full faith and credit in another if the grounds for the divorce would not be recognized by the courts of the forum.  It does not purport to challenge or disturb the rule, earlier established by Christmas v. Russell, supra, and subsequently fortified by <citedDecision>Fauntleroy</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Lum, supra,</citedDecision> that, even though the cause of action could not have been entertained in the state of the forum, a judgment obtained thereon in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit.  For the majority opinion in the Haddock case accepted both Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108 , and Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S. 155 .  Cheever v. Wilson held that a decree of divorce granted by a state in which one spouse was domiciled and which had personal jurisdiction over the other was as conclusive in other states as it was in the state where it was obtained.  Atherton v. Atherton held that full faith and credit must be given a decree of divorce granted by *297 the state of the matrimonial domicil on constructive service against the other spouse who was a non-resident of that state.  The decisive difference between those cases and Haddock v. Haddock was said to be that, in the latter, the state granting the divorce had no jurisdiction over the absent spouse, since it was not the state of the matrimonial domicil, but the place where the husband had acquired a separate domicil after having wrongfully left his wife.  This Court accordingly classified Haddock v. Haddock with that group of cases which hold that when the courts of one state do not have jurisdiction either of the subject matter or of the person of the defendant, the courts of another state are not required by virtue of the full faith and credit clause to enforce the judgment.  7 But such differences in result between Haddock v. Haddock and the cases which preceded it rest on distinctions which in our view are immaterial, so far as the full faith and credit clause and the supporting legislation are concerned.

 Beale, Constitutional Protection of Decrees for Divorce, 19 Harv. L. Rev. 586 , 596.  These intensely practical considerations emphasize for us the essential function of the full faith and credit clause in substituting a command for the former principles of comity (Broderick v. Rosner, supra, p. 643 ) and in altering the “status of the several states as independent foreign *302 sovereignties” by making them “integral parts of a single nation.” Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, p. 277.  It is objected, however, that if such divorce decrees must be given full faith and credit, a substantial dilution of the sovereignty of other states will be effected.  For it is pointed out that under such a rule one state’s policy of strict control over the institution of marriage could be thwarted by the decree of a more lax state.  But such an objection goes to the application of the full faith and credit clause to many situations.  It is an objection in varying degrees of intensity to the enforcement of a judgment of a sister state based on a cause of action which could not be enforced in the state of the forum.  Mississippi’s policy against gambling transactions was overridden in <citedDecision>Fauntleroy</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Lum, supra,</citedDecision> when a Missouri judgment based on such a Mississippi contract was enforced by this Court. Such is part of the price of our federal system.  This Court, of course, is the final arbiter when the question is raised as to what is a permissible limitation on the full faith and credit clause.  Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, supra, p. 547; Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, p. 274.  But the question for us is a limited one.  In the first place, we repeat that in this case we must assume that petitioners had a bona fide domicil in Nevada, not that .the Nevada domicil was a sham.  We thus have no question on the present record whether a divorce decree granted by the courts of one state to a resident, as distinguished from a domiciliary, is entitled to full faith and credit in another state.  Nor do we reach here the question as to the power of North Carolina to refuse full faith and credit to Nevada divorce decrees because, contrary to the findings of the Nevada court, North Carolina finds that no bona fide domicil was acquired in Nevada.
