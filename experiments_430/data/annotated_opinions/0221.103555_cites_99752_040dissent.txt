**Dissenting Opinion**
 Similarly, in St. Louis Mining & Milling Co. v. Montana Mining Co., 148 F. 450 (1906), the unsuccessful party in the federal suit was enjoined from proceeding further in the state court to relitigate matters already decided.  15 The fact that the federal proceeding was ancillary to an action to try title seems to have had no part in the decision.  16 *151 These cases were all handed down before the adoption of the Judicial Code in 1911.  They are catalogued to show that the power of the federal courts to make their decrees effective was accepted as consonant with the general prohibition of § 265.  Pomeroy taught that this was the law in 1905.  17 The rule was applied after 1911 when occasion arose.  By Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, <citedDecision>255 U. S. 356, 367</citedDecision> , it was decided in 1921 almost without discussion that a federal court which had entered a decree as to rights in a fraternal benefit association in a class suit might enjoin by ancillary bill other members of the class from relitigating the issues in a state suit.  Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co., 247 U. S. 214 , cited as a controlling precedent, was suggested there by appellant, the Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur, upon the very point here under discussion.  Id., 65 Law. Ed. 675.  This Court now lays the Looney case aside as not being a “relitigation” case. While the injunction in the Looney case was not in aid* of a decree, it was in aid of jurisdiction taken to determine a Texas rate controversy.  A temporary in j unction had been entered to maintain the status quo until a review by the Interstate Commerce Commission.  A temporary injunction may well be likened to a decree and entitled to the same protection against relitigation.  Such was evidently this Court’s view.
