**Dissenting Opinion**
 .  .  .” New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 280, 311 (dissenting opinion).  This Court, other courts, and the political process are available to correct any experiments in criminal procedure that prove fundamentally unfair to defendants.  That is not what is being done today: instead, and quite without reason, the Court has chosen to impose upon every State one means of trying criminal cases; it is a good means, but it is not the only fair means, and it is not demonstrably better than the alternatives States might devise.  I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.  See, e. g., my opinions in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 672 (dissenting); Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 44 (concurring); Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1, 14</citedDecision> (dissenting); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 408 (concurring); Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 615 (concurring); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226 (concurring).  Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), held that the first eight Amendments restricted only federal action.  The locus classicus for this viewpoint is The Federalist No. 51 (Madison).  The Bill of Rights was opposed by Hamilton and other proponents of a strong central government.  See The Federalist No. 84; see generally C. Rossiter, 1787: The Grand Convention 284, 302-303.  In Barron v. Baltimore, supra, at 250 , Chief Justice Marshall said, “These amendments demanded security against the apprehended encroachments of the general government — not against those of the local governments.” Jaffe, Was Brandéis an Activist?

**Dissenting Opinion**
 Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U. S. 22, 31 .  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 .  The right to counsel was found in the Fourteenth Amendment because, the Court held, it was essential to a fair trial. See 372 U. S., at 342-345 .  Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213 .  Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400 .  Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717 .  The same illogical way of dealing with a Fourteenth Amendment problem was employed in Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1</citedDecision> , which held that the Due Process Clause guaranteed the protection of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment against state action.  I disagreed at that time both with the way the question was framed and with the result the Court reached.  See my dissenting opinion, <citedDecision>id., at 14</citedDecision> .  I consider myself bound by the Court’s holding in <citedDecision>Malloy</citedDecision> with respect to self-incrimination.  See my concurring opinion in Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 615 .  I do not think that <citedDecision>Malloy</citedDecision> held, nor would I consider myself bound by a holding, that every question arising under the Due Process Clause shall be settled by an arbitrary decision whether a clause in the Bill of Rights is “in” or “out.” The Court has so held in, e. g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717 .  Compare Dennis v. United States, 339 U. S. 162 .  E. g., Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U. S. 516 .  E. g., Andres v. United States, 333 U. S. 740 .  With respect to the common-law .number and unanimity requirements, the Court suggests that these present no problem because “our decisions interpreting the Sixth Amendment are always subject to reconsideration .  .  .  .” Ante, at 158, n. 30.  These examples illustrate a major danger of the “incorporation” approach — that provisions of the Bill of Rights may be watered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity.  Cf. my concurring opinion in Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 44 .  Mr. Justice White alluded to this problem in his dissenting opinion in <citedDecision>Malloy</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Hogan, supra, at 38</citedDecision> .  Criminal Justice Act of 1967, § 13.  E. g., Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540 ; District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 ; District of Columbia v. Colts, 282 U. S. 63 .  The precise issue in Maxwell was whether a jury of eight rather than 12 jurors could be employed in criminal prosecutions in Utah. The Court held that this was permissible because the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the States to provide trial by jury at all. The Court seems to think this was dictum.  As a technical matter, however, a statement that is critical to the chain of reasoning by which a result is in fact reached does not become dictum simply because a later court can imagine a totally different way of deciding the case. See Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225 U. S. 167, 176 , citing Maxwell for the proposition that “the requirement of due process does not deprive a State of the power to dispense with jury trial altogether.” E. g., Irvin v. Dowd, supra, at 721 ; Fay v. New York, 332 U. S. 261, 288 ; Palko v. Connecticut, supra, at 325; Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 ; Brown v. New Jersey, 175 U. S. 172, 175 ; Missouri v. Lewis, supra, at 31 .  E. g., Deady, Trial by Jury, 17 Am. L. Rev. 398, 399-400 (1883): “Still in these days of progress and experiment, when everything is on trial at the bar of human reason or conceit, it is quite the fashion to speak of jury trial as something that has outlived its usefulness.  Intelligent and well-meaning people often sneer at it as an awkward and useless impediment to the speedy and correct administration of justice, and a convenient loop-hole for the escape of powerful and popular rogues.
