Competent defense counsel certainly should have been on notice that that offense was charged and would need to be defended against. Accordingly, there can be no showing here that Miller was prejudicially surprised at trial by the absence of proof concerning his alleged complicity in the burglary; *135 nor can there be a showing that the variance prejudiced the fairness of respondent's trial in any other way. Cf. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750 (1946). See also Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78 , 83 (1935). Cf. also United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 , 91 (1944) (Stone, C. J., dissenting). The indictment was also sufficient to allow Miller to plead it in the future as a bar to subsequent prosecutions. Therefore, none of these "notice" related concerns  which of course are among the important concerns underlying the requirement that criminal charges be set out in an indictment  would support the result of the Court of Appeals. See Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749 , 763-764 (1962). The Court of Appeals did not disagree, but instead argued that Miller had been prejudiced in his right to be free from a trial for any offense other than that alleged in the grand jury's indictment. 728 F.2d , at 1270 . It reasoned that a grand jury's willingness to indict an individual for participation in a broad criminal plan does not establish that the same grand jury would have indicted the individual for participating in a substantially narrower, even if wholly included, criminal plan.

Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1 . But here there was no alteration of the indictment, Salinger v. United States, 272 U.S. 542 , 549, nor did the court's action, in effect, add anything to it by submitting to the jury matters which it did not charge. United States v. Norris, 281 U.S. 619 , 622. In Salinger v. United States, supra , 548-9, we explicitly held that where an indictment charges several offenses, or the commission of one offense in several ways, the withdrawal from the jury's consideration of one offense or one alleged method of committing it does not constitute a forbidden amendment of the indictment. See also Goto v. Lane, 265 U.S. 393 , 402-3; Ford v. United States, 273 U.S. 593 , 602. Were the rule otherwise the common practice of withdrawing from the jury's consideration one count of an indictment while submitting others for its verdict, sustained in Dealy v. United States, 152 U.S. 539 , 542, would be a fatal error." United States v. Ballard, 322 U. S., at 90-91 (dissenting). V In light of the foregoing, the proper disposition of this case is clear. The variance complained of added nothing new to the grand jury's indictment and constituted no broadening. As in Salinger and Ford, what was removed from the case was in no way essential to the offense on which the jury convicted. We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals on the issue of whether Miller has shown any compromise of his right to be tried only on offenses for which a grand jury has returned an indictment. No such compromise has been shown. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed.

And how can it be said that, with these words stricken out, it is the indictment which was found by the grand jury?" 121 U.S. , at 9-10 . [7] Cf. United States v. Fabrizio, 385 U.S. 263 , 275 (1966) (Stewart, J. dissenting) (quoting Bain for proposition that "[w]e long ago rejected the notion that `it lies within the province of a court to change the charging part of an indictment to suit its own notions of what it ought to have been, or what the grand jury would probably have made it if their attention had been called to suggested changes . . .' "); United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 , 90-91 (1944) (Stone, C. J., dissenting) (under Bain an indictment is unconstitutionally amended "when it is so altered as to charge a different offense from that found by the grand jury"). See generally Smith v. United States, 360 U.S. 1 , 9 (1959) (citing Bain for importance of a grand jury's intervention as "a substantial safeguard against oppressive and arbitrary proceedings"); Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411 , 430 (1969) (plurality opinion) (citing Bain for proposition that "grand jury is designed to interpose an independent body of citizens between the accused and the prosecuting attorney and the court").
