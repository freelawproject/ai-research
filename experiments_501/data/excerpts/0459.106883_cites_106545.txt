*479 Mr. Justice Goldberg delivered the opinion of the Court. The critical question in this case is whether, under the circumstances, .the refusal by the police to honor petitioner’s request to consult with his lawyer during the course of an interrogation constitutes a denial of “the Assistance of Counsel” in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as “made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,” Gideon v. Wainwright, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 335, 342</citedDecision> , and thereby renders inadmissible in a state criminal trial any incriminating statement elicited by the police during the interrogation.  On the night of January 19, 1960, petitioner’s brother-in-law was fatally shot.  In the early hours of the next morning, at 2:30 a. m., petitioner was arrested without a warrant and interrogated.  Petitioner made no statement to the police and was released at 5 that afternoon pursuant to a state court writ of habeas corpus obtained by Mr. Warren Wolfson, a lawyer who had been retained by petitioner.  On January 30, Benedict DiGerlando, who was then in police custody and who was later indicted for the murder along with petitioner, told the police that petitioner had fired the fatal shots.  Between 8 and 9 that evening, petitioner and his sister, the widow of the deceased, were arrested and taken to police headquarters.  En route to the police station, the police “had handcuffed the defendant behind his back,” and “one of the arresting officers told defendant that DiGerlando had named him as the one who shot” the deceased.

 It was a stage surely as critical as was the arraignment in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 , and the preliminary hearing in White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 .  What happened at this interrogation could certainly “affect the whole trial,” Hamilton v. Alabama, supra, at 54, since rights “may be as irretrievably lost, if not then and there asserted, as they are when an accused represented by counsel waives a right for strategic purposes.” Ibid. It would exalt form over substance to make the right to counsel, under these circumstances, depend on whether at the time of the interrogation, the ¿uthorities had secured a formal indictment.  Petitioner had, for all practical purposes, already been charged with murder.  The New York Court of Appeals, whose decisions this Court cited with approval in Massiah, 377 U. S. 201, at 205 , has recently recognized that, under circumstances such as those here, no meaningful distinction can be drawn between interrogation of an accused before and after formal indictment.  In People v. Donovan, 13 N. Y. 2d 148, 193 N. E. 2d 628 , that court, in an opinion by Judge Fuld, held that a “confession taken from a defendant, during a period of detention [prior to indictment], after his attorney had requested and been denied access *487 to him” could not be used against him in a criminal trial. 6 Id., at 151, 193 N. E. 2d, at 629 .  The court observed that it “would be highly incongruous if our system of justice permitted the district attorney, the lawyer representing the State, to extract a confession from the accused while his own lawyer, seeking to speak with him, was kept from him by the police.” Id., at 152, 193 N. E. 2d, at 629 .  7 In Gideon v. Wainwright, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 335</citedDecision> , we held that every person accused of a crime, whether state or federal, is entitled to a lawyer at trial. 8 The rule sought by the State here, however, would make the trial no more than an appeal from the interrogation; and the “right to use counsel at the formal trial [would be] a very hollow thing [if], for all practical purposes, the conviction is already assured by pretrial examination.” In re Groban, 352 U. S. *488 330, 344 (Black, J., dissenting).  9 “One can imagine a cynical prosecutor saying: 'Let them have the most illustrious counsel, now.  They can’t escape the noose.  There is nothing that counsel can do for them at the trial.’ ” Ex parte Sullivan, 107 F. Supp. 514, 517-518 .  It is argued that if the right to counsel is afforded prior to indictment, the number of confessions obtained by the police will diminish significantly, because most confessions are obtained during the period between arrest and indictment, 10 and “any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under any circumstances.” Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 59 (Jackson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  This argument, of course, cuts two ways.  The fact that many confessions are obtained during this period points up its critical nature as a “stage when legal aid and advice” are surely needed.

 .  .  .” Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 519 .  We have also learned the companion lesson of history that no system of criminal justice can, or should, survive if it comes to depend for its continued effectiveness on the citizens' abdication through unawareness of their constitutional rights.  No system worth preserving should have to fear that if an accused is permitted to consult with a lawyer, he will become aware of, and exercise, these rights.  13 If the exercise of constitutional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of law enforcement, then there is something very wrong with that system.  14 We hold, therefore, that where, as here, the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the sus *491 pect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied “the Assistance of Counsel” in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as “made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,” <citedDecision>Gideon</citedDecision> v. Wainwright, <citedDecision>372 U. S., at 342</citedDecision> , and that no statement elicited by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial. Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 , does not compel a contrary result.  In that case the Court merely rejected the absolute rule sought by petitioner, that “every state denial of a request to contact counsel [is] an infringement of the constitutional right without regard to the circumstances of the case.” Id., at 440.  (Emphasis in original.) In its place, the following rule was announced: “[S]tate refusal of a request to engage counsel violates due process not only if the accused is deprived of counsel at trial on the merits, .  .  .  but also if he is deprived of counsel for any part of the pretrial proceedings, provided that he is so prejudiced thereby as to infect his subsequent trial with an absence of 'that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Putting to one side the fact that the case now before us is not a federal case, the vital fact remains that this case does not involve the deliberate interrogation of a defendant after the initiation of judicial proceedings against him.  The Court disregards this basic differenbe between the present case and Massiah’s, with the bland assertion that “that fact should make no difference.” Ante, p. 485.  It is “that fact,” I submit, which makes all the difference.  Under our system of criminal justice the institution of formal, meaningful judicial proceedings, by way of indictment, information, or arraignment, marks the *494 point at which a criminal investigation has ended and adversary proceedings have commenced.  It is at this point that the constitutional guarantees attach which pertain to a criminal trial. Among those guarantees are the right to a speedy trial, the right of confrontation, and the right to trial by jury.  Another is the guarantee of the assistance of counsel.  Gideon v. Wainwright, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 335</citedDecision> ; Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 ; White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 .  The confession which the Court today holds inadmissible was a voluntary one.  It was given during the course of a perfectly legitimate police investigation of an unsolved murder.  The Court says that what happened during this investigation “affected” the trial. I had always supposed that the whole purpose of a police investigation of a murder was to “affect” the trial of the murderer, and that it would be only an incompetent, unsuccessful, or corrupt investigation which would not do so. The Court further says that the Illinois police officers did not advise the petitioner of his “constitutional rights” before he confessed to the murder.  This Court has never held that the Constitution requires the police to give any “advice” under circumstances such as these.  Supported by no stronger authority than its own rhetoric, the Court today converts a routine police investigation of an unsolved murder into a distorted analogue of a judicial trial. It imports into this investigation constitutional concepts historically applicable only after the onset of formal prosecutorial proceedings.  By doing so, I think the Court perverts those precious constitutional guarantees, and frustrates the vital interests of society in preserving the legitimate and proper function of honest and purposeful police investigation.  Like my Brother ClaRK, I cannot escape the logic of my Brother White’s conclusions as to the extraordinary implications which emanate from the Court’s opinion in *495 this case, and I share their views as to the untold and highly unfortunate impact today’s decision may have upon the fair administration of criminal justice.  I can only hope we have completely misunderstood what the Court has said.  Mr. Justice White, with whom Mr. Justice Clark and Mr. Justice Stewart join, dissenting.  In Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 , the Court held that as of the date of the indictment the prosecution is disentitled to secure admissions from the accused.  The Court now moves that date back to the time when the prosecution begins to “focus” on the accused.  Although the opinion purports to be limited to the facts of this case, it would be naive to think that the new constitutional right announced will depend upon whether the accused has retained his own counsel, cf. Gideon v. Wainright, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 335</citedDecision> ; Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12 ; Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 , or has asked to consult with counsel in the course of interrogation.  Cf. Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U. S. 506 .  At the very least the Court holds that once the accused becomes a suspect and, presumably, is arrested, any admission made to the police thereafter is inadmissible in evidence unless the accused has waived his right to counsel.  The decision is thus another major step in the direction of the goal which the Court seemingly has in mind — to bar from evidence all admissions obtained from an individual suspected of crime, whether involuntarily made or not.  It does of course put us one step “ahead” of the English judges who have had the good sense to leave the matter a discretionary one with the trial court. * I reject this step and *496 the invitation to go farther which the Court has now issued.  By abandoning the voluntary-involuntary test for admissibility of confessions, the Court seems driven by the notion that it is uncivilized law enforcement to use an accused’s own admissions against him at his trial. It attempts to find a home for this new and nebulous rule of due process by attaching it to the right to counsel guaranteed in the federal system by the Sixth Amendment and binding upon the States by virtue of the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <citedDecision>Gideon</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wainwright, supra.</citedDecision> The right to counsel now not only entitles the accused to counsel’s advice and aid in preparing for trial but stands as an impenetrable barrier to any interrogation once the accused has become a suspect.  From that very moment apparently his right to counsel attaches, a rule wholly unworkable and impossible to administer unless police cars are equipped with public defenders and undercover agents and police informants have defense counsel at their side.  I would not abandon the Court’s prior cases defining with some care and analysis the circumstances requiring the presence or aid of counsel and substitute the amorphous and wholly unworkable principle that counsel is constitutionally required whenever he would or could be helpful.  Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52; White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 ; <citedDecision>Gideon</citedDecision> v. *497 <citedDecision>Wainwright, supra.</citedDecision> These cases dealt with the requirement of counsel at proceedings in which definable rights could be won or lost, not with stages where probative evidence might be obtained.  Under this new approach one might just as well argue that a potential defendant is constitutionally entitled to a lawyer before, not after, he commits a crime, since it is then that crucial incriminating evidence is put within the reach of the Government by the would-be accused.  Until now there simply has been no right guaranteed by the Federal Constitution to be free from the use at trial of a voluntary admission made prior to indictment.  It is incongruous to assume that the provision for counsel in the Sixth Amendment was meant to amend or supersede the self-incrimination provision of the Fifth Amendment, which is now applicable to the States.  Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 .  That amendment addresses itself to the very issue of incriminating admissions of an accused and resolves it by proscribing only compelled statements.  Neither the Framers, the constitutional language, a century of decisions of this Court nor Professor Wigmore provides an iota of support for the idea that an accused has an absolute constitutional right not to answer even in the absence of compulsion — the constitutional right not to incriminate himself by making voluntary disclosures.
