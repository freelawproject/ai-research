 In opposition, petitioner moved for an order compelling arbitration and enjoining continuation of the strike.  Concluding that the dispute was subject to arbitration under the collective-bargaining agreement and that the strike was in violation of the contract, the District Court ordered the parties to arbitrate the underlying dispute and simultaneously enjoined the strike, all picketing in the vicinity of petitioner’s supermarket, and any attempts by the union to induce the employees to strike or to refuse to perform their services.  II At the outset, we are met with respondent’s contention that Sinclair ought not to be disturbed because the decision turned on a question of statutory construction which Congress can alter at any time.  Since Congress has not modified our conclusions in Sinclair, even though it has been urged to do so, 5 respondent argues that principles of stare decisis should govern the present case. We do not agree that the doctrine of stare decisis bars a re-examination of Sinclair in the circumstances of this case. We fully recognize that important policy considerations militate in favor of continuity and predictability in the law. Nevertheless, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter *241 wrote for the Court, “[Sitare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).  See Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965).  It is precisely because Sinclair stands as a significant departure from our otherwise consistent emphasis upon the congressional policy to promote the peaceful settlement of labor disputes through arbitration 6 and our efforts to accommodate and harmonize this policy with those underlying the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act 7 that we believe Sinclair should be reconsidered.  Furthermore, in light of developments subsequent to Sinclair, in particular our decision in Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge 735, <citedDecision>390 U. S. 557</citedDecision> (1968), it has become clear that the Sinclair decision does not further but rather frustrates realization of an important goal of our national labor policy.  Nor can we agree that conclusive weight should be accorded to the failure of Congress to respond to Sinclair on the theory that congressional silence should be interpreted as acceptance of the decision.  The Court has cautioned that “[i]t is at best treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law.” Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 69 *242 (1946).  Therefore, in the absence of any persuasive circumstances evidencing a clear design that congressional inaction be taken as acceptance of Sinclair, the mere silence of Congress is not a sufficient reason for refusing to reconsider the decision.  Helvering v. Hallock, supra, at 119-120 .  Ill From the time Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U. S. 448 (1957), was decided, we have frequently found it necessary to consider various substantive and procedural aspects of federal labor contract law and questions concerning its application in both state and federal courts.  Lincoln Mills held generally that “the substantive law to apply in suits under § 301 (a) is federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws,” 353 U. S., at 456 , and more specifically that a union can obtain specific performance of an employer’s promise to arbitrate grievances.

 See 29 U. S. C. § 108 .  8 Subsequently in the Steelworkers *243 Trilogy 9 we emphasized the importance of arbitration as an instrument of federal policy for resolving disputes between labor and management and cautioned the lower courts against usurping the functions of the arbitrator.  Serious questions remained, however, concerning the role that state courts were to play in suits involving collective-bargaining agreements.  Confronted with some of these problems in Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U. S. 502 (1962), we held that Congress clearly intended not to disturb the pre-existing jurisdiction of the state courts over suits for violations of collective-bargaining agreements.  We noted that the “clear implication of the entire record of the congressional debates in both 1946 and 1947 is that the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon the federal district courts was not to displace, but to supplement, the thoroughly considered jurisdiction of the courts of the various States over contracts made by labor organizations.” Id., at 511 .  Shortly after the decision in Dowd Box, we sustained, in Teamsters Local 174 v. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U. S. 95 (1962), an award of damages by a state court to an employer for a breach by the union of a no-strike provision in its contract.. While emphasizing that “in enacting § 301 Congress intended doctrines of federal labor law uniformly to prevail over inconsistent local rules,” id., at 104, we did not consider the applicability of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to state court proceedings because the employer’s prayer for relief sought only *244 damages and not specific performance of a no-strike obligation.  Subsequent to the decision in Sinclair, we held in Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge <citedDecision>735, supra,</citedDecision> that § 301 (a) suits initially brought in state courts may be removed to the designated federal forum under the federal question removal jurisdiction delineated in 28 U. S. C. § 1441 .  In so holding, however, the Court expressly left open the questions whether state courts are bound by the anti-injunction proscriptions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and whether federal courts, after removal of a § 301 (a) action, are required to dissolve any injunctive relief previously granted by the state courts.  See generally General Electric Co. v. Local Union 191, 413 F. 2d 964 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1969) (dissolution of state injunction required).  Three Justices who concurred expressed the view that Sinclair should be reconsidered “upon an appropriate future occasion.” <citedDecision>390 U. S., at 562</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., concurring).  10 The decision in Avco, viewed in the context of Lincoln Mills and its progeny, has produced an anomalous situation which, in our view, makes urgent the reconsideration of Sinclair.  The principal practical effect of Avco and Sinclair taken together is nothing less than to oust state courts of jurisdiction in § 301 (a) suits where injunc- *245 tive relief is sought for breach of a no-strike obligation.  Union defendants can, as a matter of course, obtain removal to a federal court, 11 and there is obviously a compelling incentive for them to do so in order to gain the advantage of the strictures upon injunctive relief which Sinclair imposes on federal courts.  The sanctioning of this practice, however, is wholly inconsistent with our conclusion in Dowd Box that the congressional purpose embodied in § 301 (a) was to supplement, and not to encroach upon, the pre-existing jurisdiction of the state courts.  12 It is ironic indeed that the very provision that Congress clearly intended to provide additional remedies for breach of collective-bargaining agreements has been employed to displace previously existing state remedies.  We are not at liberty thus to depart from the clearly expressed congressional policy to the contrary.
