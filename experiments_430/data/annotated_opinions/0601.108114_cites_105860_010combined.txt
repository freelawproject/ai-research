**Combined Opinion**
 The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.  I join in the opinion of the Court although I must reject any implication in that opinion that the so-called due process test of "fundamental fairness" might have been appropriate as a constitutional standard at some point in the past or might have a continuing relevancy today in some areas of constitutional law. In my view it is a wholly fallacious idea that a judge's sense of what is fundamentally "fair" or "unfair" should ever serve as a substitute for the explicit, written provisions of our Bill of Rights.  One of these provisions is the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against putting a man twice in jeopardy.  On several occasions I have stated my view that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a State or the Federal Government or the two together from subjecting a defendant to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for the same alleged offense.  Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, 150 (1959) (dissenting opinion); Abbate v. United States, <citedDecision>359 U. S. 187, 201</citedDecision> (1959) (dissenting opinion); Ciucci v. Illinois , 356 U. S. *448 571, 575 (1958) (dissenting statement); Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957).  The opinion of the Court in the case today amply demonstrates that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is a basic and essential part of the Constitution's prohibition against double jeopardy.  Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the Court's opinion I fully agree that petitioner's conviction must be reversed.  MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.  If I were to judge this case under the traditional standards of Fourteenth Amendment due process, I would adhere to the decision in Hoag v. New Jersey, 356 U. S. 464 (1958), believing that regardless of the reach of the federal rule of collateral estoppel, it would have been open to a state court to treat the issue differently.  However, having acceded in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 744 (1969), to the decision in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969), which, over my dissent, held that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes on the States the standards of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, I am satisfied that on this present record Ashe's acquittal in the first trial brought double jeopardy standards into play.  Hence, I join the Court's opinion.  In doing so I wish to make explicit my understanding that the Court's opinion in no way intimates that the Double Jeopardy Clause embraces to any degree the "same transaction" concept reflected in the concurring opinion of my Brother BRENNAN.  MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring.  I agree that the Double Jeopardy Clause incorporates collateral estoppel as a constitutional requirement and therefore join the Court's opinion.  However, even if *449 the rule of collateral estoppel had been inapplicable to the facts of this case, it is my view that the Double Jeopardy Clause nevertheless bars the prosecution of petitioner a second time for armed robbery.  The two prosecutions, the first for the robbery of Knight and the second for the robbery of Roberts, grew out of one criminal episode, and therefore I think it clear on the facts of this case that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited Missouri from prosecuting petitioner for each robbery at a different trial. Abbate v. United States, <citedDecision>359 U. S. 187, 196-201</citedDecision> (1959) (separate opinion).  My conclusion is not precluded by the Court's decision in Hoag v. New Jersey, 356 U. S. 464 (1958), although the basic fact situation there was identical to that in this case. Three armed men entered a tavern and robbed five customers.  Hoag was tried and acquitted under indictments for robbing three of the customers.  He was then brought to trial under a fourth indictment, the same as the first three in all respects except that it named a fourth customer as the victim.  This time Hoag was convicted.  The New Jersey courts, in rejecting Hoag's double-jeopardy claim, construed the applicable New Jersey statute as making each of the four robberies, although taking place on the same occasion, a separate offense.  This construction was consistent with the state courts' view that a claim of double jeopardy cannot be upheld unless the same evidence necessary to sustain a second indictment would have been sufficient to secure a conviction on the first.
**Combined Opinion**
 E. g., Johnson v. Commonwealth, 201 Ky. 314 , 256 S. W. 388 (1923) (each of 75 poker hands a separate "offense").  Even a single criminal act may lead to multiple prosecutions if it is viewed from the perspectives of different statutes.  E. g., *452 State v. Elder, 65 Ind. 282 (1879).  Given the tendency of modern criminal legislation to divide the phases of a criminal transaction into numerous separate crimes, the opportunities for multiple prosecutions for an essentially unitary criminal episode are frightening.  And given our tradition of virtually unreviewable prosecutorial discretion concerning the initiation and scope of a criminal prosecution, [3] the potentialities for abuse inherent in the "same evidence" test are simply intolerable.  [4] The "same evidence" test is not constitutionally required.  It was first expounded after the adoption of the Fifth Amendment, and, as shown in <citedDecision>Abbate</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 197-198 and n. 2, has never been squarely held by this Court to be the required construction *453 of the constitutional phrase "same offence" in a case involving multiple trials; indeed, in that context it has been rejected.  See In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176 (1889), discussed in <citedDecision>Abbate</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 201.  The "same evidence" test may once have been defensible at English common law, which, for reasons peculiar to English criminal procedure, severely restricted the power of prosecutors to combine several charges in a single trial. [5] In vivid contrast, American criminal procedure generally allows a prosecutor freedom, subject to judicial control, to prosecute a person at one trial for all the crimes arising out of a single criminal transaction.  [6] In my view, the Double Jeopardy Clause requires the prosecution, except in most limited circumstances, [7] to join at one trial all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, *454 episode, or transaction.  This "same transaction" test of "same offence" not only enforces the ancient prohibition against vexatious multiple prosecutions embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause, but responds as well to the increasingly widespread recognition that the consolidation in one lawsuit of all issues arising out of a single transaction or occurrence best promotes justice, economy, and convenience.  [8] Modern rules of criminal and civil procedure reflect this recognition.  See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715, 724-726 (1966).  Although in 1935 the American Law Institute adopted the "same evidence" test, it has since replaced it with the "same transaction" test.

 Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 42.  Even where separate trials are permitted to avoid prejudicial joinder, the "same transaction" rule can serve a useful purpose since the defendant is at least informed at one time of all the charges on which he will actually be tried, and can prepare his defense accordingly.  Moreover, the decision on whether charges are to be tried jointly or separately will rest with the judge rather than the prosecutor.  And separate trials may not be ordered, of course, where the proofs will be repetitious, or the multiplicity of trials vexatious, or where the multiplicity will enable the prosecution to use the experience of the first trial to strengthen its case in a subsequent trial. [12]  Joinder of defendants, as distinguished from joinder of offenses, requires separate analysis.  For example, joinder of defendants can lead to Sixth Amendment problems, See, e. g., Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968).  [13]  And, of course, collateral estoppel would not prevent multiple prosecutions when the first trial ends in a verdict of guilty.  [14]  The question of separate trials for different crimes committed during a single criminal transaction is entirely distinct from and independent of the question of prosecutorial discretion to select the charges on which a defendant shall be prosecuted; and, as explained in my separate opinion in <citedDecision>Abbate, supra, at 198-199</citedDecision> , it is also distinct from and independent of the question of the imposition of separate punishments for different crimes committed during a single transaction.  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not limit the power of Congress and the States to split a single transaction into separate crimes so as to give the prosecution a choice of charges.  Cf. Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 395 (1958) (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting).  Moreover, the clause does not, as a general matter, prohibit the imposition at one trial of cumulative penalties for different crimes committed during one transaction.  See my separate opinion in <citedDecision>Abbate, supra</citedDecision> .  Thus no crime need go unpunished.  However, the clause does provide an outer limit on the power of federal and state courts to impose cumulative punishments for a single criminal transaction.  See Gore v. United States, supra, at 397-398 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).  [1]  The test was first enunciated in The King v. Vandercomb, 2 Leach 708, 720, 168 Eng. Rep. 455, 461 (Crown 1796).  [2]  If Knight and Roberts had been passengers in a car that collided with one driven by Ashe no one would seriously suggest that a jury verdict for Ashe in an action by Knight against Ashe would bar an action by Roberts against Ashe.  To present this situation shows how far the Court here has distorted collateral estoppel beyond its traditional boundaries.
