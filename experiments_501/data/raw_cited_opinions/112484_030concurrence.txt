<p id="b647-7">Today the Court squarely rejects the proposition that a governmental decision that rests on a racial classification is never permissible except as a remedy for a past wrong. <em>Ante, </em>at 564-565. I endorse this focus on the future benefit, rather than the remedial justification, of such decisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b647-8">I remain convinced, of course, that racial or ethnic characteristics provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment only in extremely rare situations and that it is therefore “especially important that the reasons for any such classification be clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate.” <em>Fullilove </em>v. <em>Klutznick, </em>448 U. S. 448, 534-535 (1980) (dissenting opinion). The Court’s opinion explains how both elements of that standard are satisfied. Specifically, the reason for the classification — the recognized interest in broadcast diversity — is clearly identified and does not imply any judgment concerning the abilities of owners of different races or the merits of different kinds of programming. Neither the favored nor the disfavored class is stigmatized in any way.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the Court demonstrates that these cases fall within the extremely narrow category of governmental decisions for which racial or ethnic heritage may provide a rational basis for differential treatment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The public interest in broadcast diver<page-number citation-index="1" label="602">*602</page-number>sity — like the interest in an integrated police force<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> diversity in the composition of a public school faculty <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or diversity in the student body of a professional school<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> — is in my view unquestionably legitimate.</p>
<p id="b648-5">Therefore, I join both the opinion and the judgment of the Court.</p>
