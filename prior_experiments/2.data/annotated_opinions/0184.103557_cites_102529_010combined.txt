Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36 , 74, 79. In the latter case Mr. Justice Miller recognized that it was so "protected by implied guarantees" of the Constitution. Id., p. 79. That was also acknowledged in Twining v. New Jersey, supra . And Chief Justice Fuller in Williams v. Fears, 179 U.S. 270 , 274, stated: "Undoubtedly the right of locomotion, the right to remove from one place to another according to inclination, is an attribute of personal liberty, and the right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the territory of any State is a right secured by the Fourteenth Amendment and by other provisions of the Constitution." In the face of this history I cannot accede to the suggestion ( Helson & Randolph v. Kentucky, 279 U.S. 245 , 251; Colgate v. Harvey, <targetCase>296 U.S. 404</targetCase> , 444) that the commerce clause is the appropriate explanation of Crandall v. Nevada, supra . Two of the Justices in that case expressly *180 put the decision on the commerce clause; the others put it on the broader ground of rights of national citizenship, Mr. Justice Miller stating that "we do not concede that the question before us is to be determined" by the commerce clause. Id., p. 43. On that broader ground it should continue to rest. To be sure, there are expressions in the cases that this right of free movement of persons is an incident of state citizenship protected against discriminatory state action by Art. IV, § 2 of the Constitution. Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash. C.C.
