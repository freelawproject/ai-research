 I.  The Fourth Amendment provides that, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” The basic purpose of this Amendment, as recognized in countless decisions of this Court, is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.  The Fourth Amendment thus gives concrete expression to a right of the people which “is basic to a free society.” Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 27 .  As such, the Fourth Amendment is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 30 .  Though there has been general agreement as to the fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment, translation of the abstract prohibition against “unreasonable searches and seizures” into workable guidelines for the decision of particular cases is a difficult task which has for many years divided the members of this Court. Nevertheless, one governing principle, justified by history and by current experience, has consistently been followed: except in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper con *529 sent is “unreasonable” unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant.  See, e. g., Stoner v. California, <citedDecision>376 U. S. 483</citedDecision> ; United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48 ; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 ; Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20 .  As the Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10 , 14: “The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home is also a grave concern, not only to the individual but to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance.  When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or government enforcement agent.” In Frank v. Maryland , this Court upheld the conviction of one who refused to permit a warrantless inspection of private premises for the purposes of locating and abating a suspected public nuisance.  Although Frank can arguably be distinguished from this case on its facts, 4 the Frank opinion has generally been interpreted as carving out an additional exception to the rule that warrantless searches are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  See Eaton v. Price, supra. The District Court of Appeal so interpreted Frank in this case, and that ruling is the core of appellant’s challenge here.  We proceed to a re-examination of the factors which *530 persuaded the Frank majority to adopt this construction of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches.  To the Frank majority, municipal fire, health, and housing inspection programs “touch at most upon the periphery of the important interests safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection against official intrusion,” 359 U. S., at 367 , because the inspections are merely to determine whether physical conditions exist which do not comply with minimum standards prescribed in local regulatory ordinances.

 Thus, as a practical matter and in light of the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that a warrant specify the property to be searched, it seems likely that warrants should normally be sought only after entry is refused unless *540 there has been a citizen complaint or there is other satisfactory reason for securing immediate entry.  Similarly, the requirement of a warrant procedure does not suggest any change in what seems to be the prevailing local policy, in most situations, of authorizing entry, but not entry by force, to inspect.  IV. In this case, appellant has been charged with a crime for his refusal to permit housing inspectors to enter his leasehold without a warrant.  There was no emergency demanding immediate access; in fact, the inspectors made three trips to the building in an attempt to obtain appellant’s consent to search.  Yet no warrant was obtained and thus appellant was unable to verify either the need for or the appropriate limits of the inspection.  No doubt, the inspectors entered the public portion of the building with the consent of the landlord, through the building’s manager, but appellee does not contend that such consent was sufficient to authorize inspection of appellant’s premises.  Cf. Stoner v. California, <citedDecision>376 U. S. 483</citedDecision> ; Chapman v. United States, 365 U. S. 610 ; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 .  Assuming the facts to be as the parties have alleged, we therefore conclude that appellant had a constitutional right to insist that the inspectors obtain a warrant to search and that appellant may not constitutionally be convicted for refusing to consent to the inspection.  It appears from the opinion of the District Court of Appeal that under these circumstances a writ of prohibition will issue to the criminal court under California law. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  [For dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Clark, see post, p. 546.] 1 The inspection was conducted pursuant to § 86 (3) of the San Francisco Municipal Code, which provides that apartment house operators shall pay an annual license fee in part to defray the cost of periodic inspections of their buildings.  The inspections are to be made by the Bureau of Housing Inspection “at least once a year and as often thereafter as may be deemed necessary.” The permit of occupancy, which prescribes the apartment units which a building may contain, is not issued until the license is obtained.
