<p id="Ap">(concurring and in part dissenting).</p>
<p id="b59-12">I agree with my brothers of the majority on all points except the sentence to a period of two years imprisonment. This, in my opinion, is too much. We have held that this Court has power to reduce the period of imprisonment meted out for a contempt of court, see United States v. Levine, 2 Cir. 1961, <span class="citation" data-id="253486"><a href="/opinion/253486/united-states-v-morry-levine/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

I realize that this Court has upheld sentences of two years in similar cases, but I wish to register my dissent.</p>
