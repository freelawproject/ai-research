Under the various allotment acts he received in return land which was intended to have the same measure of protection for a temporary period, generally subject to extension.  Thus the General Allotment Act of 1887 ( 24 Stat. 388 ) provided for the issuance to allottees of trust patents which were to declare: “the United States does .  .  .  hold the land thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust.. .  and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian ... in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever.” 8 Lands so held in trust are immune from state taxation.  United States v. Rickert, <citedDecision>188 U. S. 432</citedDecision> .  The lands here involved were not allotted under “trust patents”; they were grants in fee subject to restrictions against alienation and encumbrance.  9 But there are no differences of substance between the two forms of tenure which suggest that while the one is exempt from state taxation, the other is not, or that Congress intended to favor Indians holding under “trust patents” over those holding restricted fees.  ‘ Cf. The Kansas Indians, supra, at p. 755.  The power of Congress over “trust” and “restricted” lands is the same, Board of Commissioners v. Seber, supra, and in practice the terms have been used interchangeably.  See United States v. Bowling, 256 U. S. 484 ; cf. Minnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382 .  Both devices had a common purpose, to protect a dependent *619 people against loss of their property through their own improvidence or the greed of others during the period of transition in which they began to assume the responsibilities of citizenship.
