**Combined Opinion**
For example, where one ship's fault in causing a collision is relatively slight and her damages small, and where the second ship is grossly negligent and suffers extensive damage, the first ship must still make a substantial payment to the second. "This result hardly commends itself to the sense of justice any more appealingly than does the common law doctrine of contributory negligence . . . ." Gilmore & Black 528. And the potential unfairness of the division is magnified by the application of the rule of The Pennsylvania, *406 19 Wall. 125 , whereby a ship's relatively minor statutory violation will require her to bear half the collision damage unless she can satisfy the heavy burden of showing "not merely that her fault might not have been one of the causes, or that it probably was not, but that it could not have been." Id., at 136 (emphasis added). See O/Y Finlayson-Forssa A/B v. Pan Atlantic S. S. Corp., 259 F. 2d 11 , 22 (CA5); The New York Marine No. 10, 109 F. 2d 564 , 566 (CA2). See also Griffin, supra, ยง 202. The Court has long implicitly recognized the patent harshness of an equal division of damages in the face of disparate blame by applying the "major-minor" fault doctrine to find a grossly negligent party solely at fault. [12] But this escape valve, in addition to being inherently unreliable, simply replaces one unfairness with another.
