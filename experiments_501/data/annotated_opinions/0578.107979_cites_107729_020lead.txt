 *762 Even in the Agnello case the Court relied upon the rule that “[b]elief, however well founded, that an article sought is concealed in a dwelling house furnishes no justification for a search of that place without a warrant.  And such searches are held unlawful notwithstanding facts unquestionably showing probable cause.” 269 U. S., at 33 .  Clearly, the general requirement that a search warrant be obtained is not lightly to be dispensed with, and “the burden is on those seeking [an] exemption [from the requirement] to show the need for it .  .  .  .” United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48, 51 .  Only last Term in Terry v. Ohio, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 1</citedDecision> , we emphasized that “the police must, whenever practicable, obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure,” <citedDecision>id., at 20</citedDecision> , 6 and that “[t]he scope of [a] search must be ‘strictly tied to and justified by’ the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.” <citedDecision>Id., at 19</citedDecision> .  The search undertaken by the officer in that “stop and frisk” case was sustained under that test, because it was no more than a “protective .  .  .  search for weapons.” <citedDecision>Id., at 29</citedDecision> .  But in a companion case, Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 , we applied the same standard to another set of facts and reached a contrary result, holding that a policeman’s action in thrusting his hand into a suspect’s pocket had been neither motivated by nor limited to the objective of protection.  7 Rather, the search had been made in order to find narcotics, which were in fact found. A similar analysis underlies the “search incident to arrest” principle, and marks its proper extent.  When an *763 arrest is made, it is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape.  Otherwise, the officer’s safety might well be endangered, and the arrest itself frustrated.  In addition, it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee’s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction.  And the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary items must, of course, be governed by a like rule.
