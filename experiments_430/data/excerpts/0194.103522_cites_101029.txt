**Combined Opinion**
 The power of Congress under the commerce clause to authorize the fixing of minimum prices for milk was upheld in United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, 307 U. S. 533 , decided in 1939.  The next year the price-fixing provisions of the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937 were sustained.  Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U. S. 381 .  And 'at this term we upheld the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.  United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 .  These cases represent more than scattered examples of constitutionally permissible price-fixing schemes.  They represent in large measure a basic departure from the philosophy and approach of the majority in the Ribnik case. The standard there Employed, following that used in Tyson & Brother v. Banton, <citedDecision>273 U. S. 418</citedDecision> , 430 et seq., was that the constitutional validity of price-fixing legislation, at least in absence of a so-called emergency, 6 was dependent on whether or not the business in question was “affected with a.public interest.” Cf. Brazee v. Michigan, 241 U. S. 340 .  It was said to be so affected if it had been “devoted to the public .use” and if “an interest in effect” had been granted “to the public in that use.” Ribnik v. McBride, supra, p. 355 .  That test, labelled by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent in the Tyson case (273 U. S. at p. 446) as “little more than a fiction,” was discarded in Nebbia v. New York, supra, pp. 531-539.  It was there stated that such criteria “are not susceptible of definition and form an unsatisfactory test of the constitutionality of legislation directed at business practices or prices,” and that the phrase “affected with a public interest” can mean “no more than *246 that an industry, for adequate reason, is subject to control for the public good.” Id., p. 536.  And see the dissenting opinion in Ribnik v. McBride, supra, at p. 359 .  The Bibnik case, freed from'.the test which it employed, can no longer survive.  But respondents maintain that the statute here in question is invalid for other reasons.

 Differences of opinion on that score suggest a choice which “should be' left where .  .  .  it was left by the Constitution — to the States and to Congress.” Ribnik v. McBride, supra, at p. 375 , dissenting opinion.  There isl no necessity for the state to demonstrate before us that evils persist despite the competition which attends the bargaining in this field.  In final analysis, the only constitutional pro- *247 hibitións ór restraints which respondents have, suggested for the invalidation of this legislation are those notions of public policy embedded in earlier decisions of this Court but.  which, as Mr. Justice Holmes long admonished, should not be read into the Constitution.. Tyson & Brother v. <citedDecision>Banton, supra,</citedDecision> at p: 446; Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, supra, at p. 570.  Since they do not find expression in the Constitution, we cannot give them continuing vitality as standards by .which the constitutionality of the economic and social programs of the states is to be determined'.  The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Nebraska for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  Reversed.  1 Neb. Comp.
