Mr. Justice Douglas delivered the opinion of the Court. In 1943 petitioner, a native of Canada, filed his petition for naturalization in the District Court of Massachusetts.  He stated in his application that he understood the prin *62 ciples of the government of the United States, believed in its form of government, and was willing to take the oath of allegiance ( 54 Stat. 1157 , 8 U. S. C. § 735 (b)) which reads as follows: “I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion: So help me God.” To the question in the application “If necessary, are you willing to take up arms in defense of this country?” he replied, “No (Non-combatant) Seventh Day Adventist.” He explained that answer before the examiner by saying “it is a purely religious matter with me, I have no political or personal reasons other than that.” He did not claim before his Selective Service board exemption from all military service, but only from combatant military duty.  At the hearing in the District Court petitioner testified that he was a member of the Seventh Day Adventist denomination, of whom approximately 10,000 were then serving in the armed forces of the United States as non-combatants, especially in the medical corps; and that he was willing to serve in the army but would not bear arms.  The District Court admitted him to citizenship.  The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting.  149 F. 2d 760 .  It took that action on the authority of United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U. S. 644 ; United States v. Macintosh, 283 U. S. 605 , and United States v. Bland, <citedDecision>283 U. S. 636</citedDecision> , saying that the facts of the present case brought it squarely within the principle of those cases. The case is here on *63 a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted so that those authorities might be re-examined.  The Schwimmer, Macintosh and <citedDecision>Bland</citedDecision> cases involved, as does the present one, a question of statutory construction.  At the time of those cases, Congress required an alien, before admission to citizenship, to declare on oath in open court that “he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” 1 It also required the court to be satisfied that the alien had during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of his application “behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.” 2 Those provisions were reenacted into the present law in substantially the same, form.  3 While there are some factual distinctions between this case and the Schwimmer and Macintosh cases, the <citedDecision>Bland</citedDecision> case on its facts is indistinguishable.  But the principle emerging from the three cases obliterates any factual distinction among them.  As we recognized in In re Summers, 325 U. S. 561, 572, 577 , they stand for the same general rule — that an alien who refuses to bear arms will not be admitted to citizenship.  As an original proposition, we could not agree with that rule.  The fallacies underlying *64 it were, we think, demonstrated in the dissents of Mr. Justice Holmes in the Schwimmer case and of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes in the Macintosh case. The oath required of aliens does not in terms require that they promise to bear arms.  Nor has Congress expressly made any such finding a prerequisite to citizenship.  To hold that it is required is to read it into the Act by implication.

 Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 .” The test oath is abhorrent to our tradition.  Over the years, Congress has meticulously respected that tradition and even in time of war has sought to accommodate the military requirements to the religious scruples of the individual.  We do not believe that Congress intended to reverse that policy when it came to draft the naturalization oath.  Such an abrupt and radical departure from our traditions should not be implied.  See Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U. S. 118, 132 .  Cogent evidence would be necessary to convince us that Congress took that course.  We conclude that the Schwimmer, Macintosh and <citedDecision>Bland</citedDecision> cases do not state the correct rule of law. We are met, however, with the argument that, even though those cases were wrongly decided, Congress has adopted the rule which they announced.  The argument runs as follows: Many efforts were made to amend the law so as to change the rule announced by those cases; but in every instance the bill died in committee.  Moreover, when the Nationality Act of 1940 was passed, Congress reenacted the oath in its pre-existing form, though at the same time it made extensive changes in the requirements and procedure for naturalization.  From this it is argued that Congress adopted and reenacted the rule of the Schwimmer, Macintosh and <citedDecision>Bland</citedDecision> cases. Cf. Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U. S. 469, 488-489 .  We stated in Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 , that “It would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from reexamining its own doctrines.” It is at best treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law. We do not think under the circumstances of this legislative history that we can properly *70 place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court’s own error.  The history of the 1940 Act is at most equivocal.  It contains no affirmative recognition of the rule of the Schwimmer, Macintosh and <citedDecision>Bland</citedDecision> cases. The silence of Congress and its inaction are as consistent with a desire to leave the problem fluid as they are with an adoption by silence of the rule of those cases. But, for us, it is enough to say that since the date of those cases Congress never acted affirmatively on this question but once and that was in 1942.  At that time, as we have noted, Congress specifically granted naturalization privileges to non-combatants who like petitioner were prevented from bearing arms by their religious scruples.  That was affirmative recognition that one could be attached to the principles of our government and could support and defend it even though his religious convictions prevented him from bearing arms.  And, as we have said, we cannot believe that the oath was designed to exact something more from one person than from another.  Thus the affirmative action taken by Congress in 1942 negatives any inference that otherwise might be drawn from its silence when it reenacted the oath in 1940.  Reversed.  Mr. Justice Jackson took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. Naturalization Act of 1906, § 4, 34 Stat. 596 .
