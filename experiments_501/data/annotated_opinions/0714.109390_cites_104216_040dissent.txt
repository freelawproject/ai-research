 .  directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put.” Id., at 320 n. 9.  Lloyd involved the distribution of antiwar handbills in a large shopping center, and while some of us viewed *536 the case differently, 407 U. S., at 570, 577-579 (Marshall, J., dissenting), the Court treated it as presenting the question left open in Logan Valley.  But the Court did no more than decide that question.  It preserved the holding of Logan Valley, as limited to cases in which (1) the picketing is directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property is put, and (2) “no other reasonable opportunities for the pickets to convey their message to their intended audience [are] available.” 407 U. S., at 563.  The Court today gives short shrift to the language in Lloyd preserving Logan Valley, and quotes extensively from language that admittedly differs in emphasis from much of the language of Logan Valley.  But even the language quoted by the Court says no more than that the dedication of the Lloyd Center to public use was more limited than the dedication of the company town in Marsh v. Alabama, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 501</citedDecision> (1946), and that the pickets in Lloyd were not entitled to exercise.  “the asserted First Amendment rights” — that is, the right to distribute antiwar handbills.  Any doubt about the limited scope of Lloyd is removed completely by a consideration of Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 (1972), decided the same day as Lloyd.  In Central Hardware the Court was faced with solicitation by nonemployee union organizers on a parking lot of a retail store that was not part of a shopping center complex — activity clearly related to the use to which the private property had been put.  The Court found the activity unprotected by the First Amendment, but in a way that explicitly preserved the holding in Logan Valley.  The Court could have held that the First Amendment has no application to use-related activity on privately owned business property, thereby rejecting Logan Valley, but instead the Court chose to *537 distinguish the parking lot in Central Hardware from the shopping center complex in Logan Valley.  Rejecting the argument that the opening of property to the general public suffices to activate the prohibition of the First Amendment, the Court explained: “This analysis misconceives the rationale of Logan Valley.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 I continue to believe that the First Amendment principles underlying Logan Valley are sound, and were unduly limited in Lloyd.  But accepting Lloyd, I am not convinced that Logan Valley must be overruled.  The foundation of Logan Valley consisted of this Court’s decisions recognizing a right of access to streets, sidewalks, parks, and other public places historically associated with the exercise of First Amendment rights.  E. g., Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496, 515-516 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 308 (1940); Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569, 574 (1941); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413 (1943); Saia v. New York, 334 U. S. 558 (1948).  Thus, the Court in Logan Valley observed that access to such forums “cannot constitutionally be denied broadly and absolutely.” 391 U. S., at 315 .  The importance of access to such places for speech-related purposes is clear, for they are often the only places for effective speech and assembly.  <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Alabama, supra,</citedDecision> which the Court purports to leave untouched, made clear that in applying those cases granting a right of access to streets, sidewalks, and other public places, courts ought not let the formalities of title put an end to analysis.  The Court in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> observed that “the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the *539 property belongs to a private corporation.” <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 503</citedDecision> .  That distinction was not determinative: “Ownership does not always mean absolute dominion.  The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.” <citedDecision>Id., at 506</citedDecision> .  Regardless of who owned or possessed the town in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , the Court noted, “the public .  .  .  has an identical interest in the functioning of the community in such manner that the channels of communication remain free,” <citedDecision>id., at 507</citedDecision> , and that interest was held to prevail.  The Court adopts the view that <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> has no bearing on this case because the privately owned property in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> involved all the characteristics of a typical town.  But there is nothing in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> to suggest that its general approach was limited to the particular facts of that case. The underlying concern in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> was that traditional public channels of communication remain free, regardless of the incidence of ownership.  Given that concern, the crucial fact in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> was that the company owned the traditional forums essential for effective communication; it was immaterial that the company also owned a sewer system and that its property in other respects resembled a town.  In Logan Valley we recognized what the Court today refuses to recognize — that the owner of the modern shopping center complex, by dedicating his property to public use as a business district, to some extent displaces ■the “State” from control of historical First Amendment forums, and may acquire a virtual monopoly of places suitable for effective communication.  The roadways, parking lots, and walkways of the modern shopping cen *540 ter may be as essential for effective speech as the streets and sidewalks in the municipal or company-owned town.  7 I simply cannot reconcile the Court’s denial of any role for the First Amendment in the shopping center with Marsh’s recognition of a full role for the First Amendment on the streets and sidewalks of the company-owned town.  My reading of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> admittedly carried me farther than the Court in Lloyd, but the Lloyd Court remained responsive in its own way to the concerns underlying Marsh. Lloyd retained the availability of First Amendment protection when the picketing is related to the function of the shopping center, and when there is no other reasonable opportunity to convey the message to the intended audience.  Preserving Logan Valley subject to Lloyd’s two related criteria guaranteed that the First Amendment would have application in those situations in which the shopping center owner had most clearly monopolized the forums essential for effective communication.  This result, although not the optimal one in my view, Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S., at 579-583 (Marshall, J., dissenting), is nonetheless defensible.  In <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , the private entity had displaced the “state” from control of all the places to which the public had historically enjoyed access for First Amendment purposes, and the First Amendment was accordingly held fully applicable to the private entity’s conduct.  The shopping center owner, on the other hand, controls only *541 a portion of such places, leaving other traditional public forums available to the citizen.  But the shopping center owner may nevertheless control all places essential for the effective undertaking of some speech-related activities — namely, those related to the activities of the shopping center.  As for those activities, then, the First Amendment ought to have application under the reasoning of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , and that was precisely the state of the law after Lloyd.  The Court’s only apparent objection to this analysis is that it makes the applicability of the First Amendment turn to some degree on the subject matter of the speech.  But that in itself is no objection, and the cases cited by the Court to the effect that government may not “restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content,” Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972), are simply inapposite.  In those cases, it was clearly the government that was acting, and the First Amendment’s bar against infringing speech was unquestionably applicable; the Court simply held that the government, faced with a general command to permit speech, cannot choose to forbid some speech because of its message.  The shopping center cases are quite different; in these cases the primary regulator is a private entity whose property has “assume[d] to some significant degree the functional attributes of public property devoted to public use.” Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S., at 547.  The very question in these cases is whether, and under what circumstances, the First Amendment has any application at all. The answer to that question, under the •view of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> described above, depends to some extent on the subject of the speech the private entity seeks to regulate, because the degree to which the private entity monopolizes the effective channels of communication *542 may depend upon what subject is involved.  8 This limited reference to the subject matter of the speech poses none of the dangers of government suppression or censorship that lay at the heart of the cases cited by the Court. See, e. g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, supra, at 95-96 .  It is indeed ironic that those cases, whose obvious concern was the promotion of free speech, are cited today to require its surrender.  In the final analysis, the Court's rejection of any role for the First Amendment in the privately owned shopping center complex stems, I believe, from an overly formalistic view of the relationship between the institution of private ownership of property and the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech.  No one would seriously question the legitimacy of the values of privacy and individual autonomy traditionally associated with privately owned property.  But property that is privately owned is not always held for private use, and when a property owner opens his property to public use the force of those values diminishes.  A degree of privacy is necessarily surrendered; thus, the privacy interest that petitioner retains when he leases space to 60 retail businesses and invites the public onto his land for the transaction of business with other members of the public is small indeed.
