 Indeed, a deterrent effect would be suggested if, once again all other things being equal, one State abolished the death penalty and experienced no change in the murder rate, while another State experienced an increase in the murder rate.  9 The most compelling criticism of the Ehrlich study is *236 that its conclusions are extremely sensitive to the choice of the time period included in the regression analysis.  Analysis of Ehrlich’s data reveals that all empirical support for the deterrent effect of capital'punishment disappears when the five most recent years are removed from his time series — that is to say, whether a decrease in the execution risk corresponds to an increase or a-decrease in the murder rate depends on the ending point of the sample period.  10 This finding has east severe doubts on the reliability of Ehrlich’s tentative conclusions.  11 Indeed, a recent regression study, based on Ehrlich’s theoretical model but using cross-section state data for the years 1950 and 1960, found no support for the conclusion that executions act as a deterrent.  12 The Ehrlich study, in short, is of little, if any, assistance in assessing the deterrent impact of the death penalty.

The evidence I reviewed in Furman 13 remains convincing, in my view, that “capital punishment is not necessary as a deterrent to crime in our society.” 408 U. S., at 353 .  The justification for the death penalty must be found elsewhere.  The other principal purpose said to be served by the death penalty is retribution.  14 The notion that retribu *237 tion can serve as a moral justification for the sanction of death finds credence in the opinion of my Brothers Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, and that of my Brother White in Roberts v. Louisiana, post, p. 337.  See also Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 394-395 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).  It is this notion that I find to be the most disturbing aspect of today’s unfortunate decisions.

In Furman , I considered several additional purposes arguably served by the death penalty.  408 U. S., at 314, 342, 355-358 .  The only additional purpose mentioned in the opinions in, these cases is specific deterrence — preventing the murderer from com *237 mitting another crime.  Surely life imprisonment and, if necessary, solitary confinement would fully accomplish- this purpose.  Accord, Commonwealth v. O’Neal, — Mass. —, —, <citedDecision>339 N.

Mr. Justice White’s view of retribution as a justification for the death penalty is not altogether clear.  “The widespread reenactment of the death penalty,” he states at one point, “answers any claims that life imprisonment is adequate punishment to satisfy the need for reprobation or retribution.” Roberts v. Louisiana, post, at 354.  (White, J„ dissenting).  But Mr. Justice White later states: “It will not do to denigrate these legislative judgments as some form of vestigial savagery or as purely retributive in motivation; for they are solemn judgments, reasonably based, that imposition of the death penalty will save the fives of innocent persons."
