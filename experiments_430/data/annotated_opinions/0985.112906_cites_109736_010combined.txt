 .  .  prosecution for contempt of court." § 23-1329(a).  Obviously, Dixon could not commit an "offence" under this provision until an order setting out conditions was issued.  The statute by itself imposes no legal obligation on anyone.  Dixon's cocaine possession, although an offense under D. C. Code Ann. § 33-541(a) (1988 and Supp. 1992), was not an offense under § 23-1329 until a *698 judge incorporated the statutory drug offense into his release order.  In this situation, in which the contempt sanction is imposed for violating the order through commission of the incorporated drug offense, the later attempt to prosecute Dixon for the drug offense resembles the situation that produced our judgment of double jeopardy in Harris v. Oklahoma, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 682</citedDecision> (1977) (per curiam) .  There we held that a subsequent prosecution for robbery with a firearm was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, because the defendant had already been tried for felony murder based on the same underlying felony.  We have described our terse per curiam in <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> as standing for the proposition that, for double jeopardy purposes, "the crime generally described as felony murder" is not "a separate offense distinct from its various elements." Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410, 420-421 (1980).  Accord, Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684, 694 (1980).  So too here, the "crime" of violating a condition of release cannot be abstracted from the "element" of the violated condition.  The Dixon court order incorporated the entire governing criminal code in the same manner as the <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> felony-murder statute incorporated the several enumerated felonies.  Here, as in <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> , the underlying substantive criminal offense is "a species of lesser-included offense." [2] Vitale, supra, at 420 .  Accord, Whalen, supra .  *699 To oppose this analysis, the Government can point only to dictum in In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 594, 599-600 (1895), which, to the extent it attempted to exclude certain nonsummary contempt prosecutions from various constitutional protections for criminal defendants, has been squarely rejected by cases such as Bloom, 391 U. S., at 208.  The Government also relies upon In re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661 (1897), and Jurney v. MacCracken, 294 U. S. 125 (1935), which recognize Congress' power to punish as contempt the refusal of a witness to testify before it.  But to say that Congress can punish such a refusal is not to say that a criminal court can punish the same refusal yet again.  Neither case dealt with that issue, and Chapman specifically declined to address it, noting that successive prosecutions (before Congress for contemptuous refusal to testify and before a court for violation of a federal statute making such refusal a crime) were "improbable."

Brown, supra, at 166-167, n. 6 .  Not only is this footnote the purest dictum, but it flatly contradicts the text of the opinion which, on the very next page, describes Nielsen as the first Supreme Court case to endorse the Blockburger rule.  Brown, supra, at 168 .  Quoting that suspect dictum multiple times, see post, at 748, 754, cannot convert it into case law. See United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439, 463, n. 11 (1993) (emphasizing "the need to distinguish an opinion's holding from its dicta").  The holding of Brown , like that of Nielsen , rests squarely upon the existence of a lesser included offense.  432 U. S., at 162 (setting out question presented).  The third case is <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> , which Justice Souter asserts was a reaffirmation of what he contends was the earlier holding in Nielsen , that the Blockburger test is "insufficien[t] for determining when a successive prosecution [is] barred," and that conduct, and not merely elements of the offense, must be the object of inquiry.  Post, at 755.  Surely not.  <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> never uses the word "conduct," and its entire discussion focuses on the elements of the two offenses.  See, e. g., <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 682-683</citedDecision> , n. (to prove felony murder, "it was necessary for all the ingredients of the underlying felony" to be proved).  Far from validating Justice Souter's extraordinarily implausible reading of Nielsen, Harris plainly rejects that reading, treating the earlier case as having focused (like Blockburger ) upon the elements of the offense.  Immediately *707 after stating that conviction for felony murder, a "greater crime," "cannot be had without conviction of the lesser crime," the <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> Court quotes Nielsen `s statement that "`a person [who] has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it, .  .  .  cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents.' " <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 682-683</citedDecision> , quoting from 131 U. S., at 188 .  It is clear from that context that <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> regarded "incidents included" to mean "offenses included"a reference to defined crimes rather than to conduct.  Finally, Justice Souter misdescribes Vitale .  Despite his bold assertion to the contrary, see post, at 757, Vitale unquestionably reads <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> as merely an application of the double jeopardy bar to lesser and greater included offenses.  [11] Justice Souter instead elevates the statement in Vitale that, on certain hypothetical facts, the petitioner would have a "substantial" "claim" of double jeopardy on a Grady -type theory, see post, at 756-757, into a holding that the petitioner would win on that theory.  Post, at 757, 763.  No Justice, the Vitale dissenters included, has ever construed this passage as answering, rather than simply raising, the question on which we later granted certiorari in Grady .  See 447 U. S., at 426 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (in addition to finding the same-conduct claim "substantial," dissent would find it "dispositive").  See also Grady, 495 U. S., at 510 ( Vitale "suggested" same-conduct test adopted in Grady ).  In contrast to the above-discussed dicta relied upon by Justice Souter, there are two pre- Grady ( and post Nielsen ) cases that are directly on point.
**Combined Opinion**
 Less than two years after it came down, in United States v. Felix, 503 U. S. 378 (1992), we were forced to recognize a large exception to it.  There we concluded that a subsequent prosecution for conspiracy to manufacture, possess, and distribute methamphetamine was not barred by a previous conviction for attempt to manufacture the same substance.  We offered as a justification for avoiding a "literal" ( i.  e., faithful) reading of Grady "longstanding authority" to the effect that prosecution for conspiracy is not precluded by prior prosecution for the substantive offense.  Felix, supra, at 388-391 .  Of course the very existence of such a large and longstanding "exception" to the *710 Grady rule gave cause for concern that the rule was not an accurate expression of the law. This "past practice" excuse is not available to support the ignoring of Grady in the present case, since there is no Supreme Court precedent even discussing this fairly new breed of successive prosecution (criminal contempt for violation of a court order prohibiting a crime, followed by prosecution for the crime itself).  A hypothetical based on the facts in <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> reinforces the conclusion that Grady is a continuing source of confusion and must be overruled.  Suppose the State first tries the defendant for felony murder, based on robbery, and then indicts the defendant for robbery with a firearm in the same incident.  Absent Grady , our cases provide a clear answer to the double jeopardy claim in this situation.  Under Blockburger , the second prosecution is not barredas it clearly was not barred at common law, as a famous case establishes.  In King v. Vandercomb, 2 Leach.  708, 717, 168 Eng. Rep. 455, 460 (K. B. 1796), the government abandoned, midtrial, prosecution of defendant for burglary by breaking and entering and stealing goods, because it turned out that no property had been removed on the date of the alleged burglary.  The defendant was then prosecuted for burglary by breaking and entering with intent to steal.
**Combined Opinion**
 After finding that at least some of the charges here are not prohibited by the "same-elements" test set out in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932), the Court goes on to consider whether there is a double jeopardy bar under the "same-conduct" test set out in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508, 510 (1990), and determines that there is.  However, because the same-conduct test is inconsistent with the text and history of the Double Jeopardy Clause, was a departure from our earlier precedents, and has proven difficult to apply, the Court concludes that Grady must be overruled.  I do not join Part III of Justice Scalia's opinion because I think that none of the criminal prosecutions in this case were barred under Blockburger .  I must then confront the expanded version of double jeopardy embodied in Grady .  For the reasons set forth in the dissent in Grady, supra, at 526 (opinion of Scalia, J.), and in Part IV of the Court's opinion, I, too, think that Grady must be overruled.  I *714 therefore join Parts I, II, and IV of the Court's opinion, and write separately to express my disagreement with Justice Scalia's application of Blockburger in Part III. In my view, Blockburger `s same-elements test requires us to focus, not on the terms of the particular court orders involved, but on the elements of contempt of court in the ordinary sense.  Relying on Harris v. Oklahoma, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 682</citedDecision> (1977), a three-paragraph per curiam in an unargued case, Justice Scalia concludes otherwise today, and thus incorrectly finds in Part IIIA of his opinion that the subsequent prosecutions of Dixon for drug distribution and of Foster for assault violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.  In so doing, Justice Scalia rejects the traditional viewshared by every Federal Court of Appeals and State Supreme Court that addressed the issue prior to Grady that, as a general matter, double jeopardy does not bar a subsequent prosecution based on conduct for which a defendant has been held in criminal contempt.  I cannot subscribe to a reading of <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> that upsets this previously well-settled principle of law. Because the generic crime of contempt of court has different elements than the substantive criminal charges in this case, I believe that they are separate offenses under Blockburger .  I would therefore limit <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> to the context in which it arose: where the crimes in question are analogous to greater and lesser included offenses.  The crimes at issue here bear no such resemblance.  Justice Scalia dismisses out-of-hand, see ante, at 699, the Government's reliance on several statements from our prior decisions.  See In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 594, 599-600 (1895); In re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661, 672 (1897); Jurney v. MacCracken, 294 U. S. 125, 151 (1935).  Those statements are dicta, to be sure, and thus not binding on us as stare decisis.  Yet they are still significant in that they reflect the unchallenged contemporaneous view among all courts that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit separate prosecutions for contempt and a substantive offense based *715 on the same conduct.  [1] This view, which dates back to the English common law, see F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice § 444, p. 300 (8th ed. 1880), has prevailed to the present day. See generally 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law § 250, p. 446 (1981).
**Combined Opinion**
 There, we stated that two offenses are different for *716 purposes of double jeopardy if "each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not." 284 U. S., at 304 (emphasis added).  Applying this test to the offenses at bar, it is clear that the elements of the governing contempt provision are entirely different from the elements of the substantive crimes.  Contempt of court comprises two elements: (i) a court order made known to the defendant, followed by (ii) willful violation of that order.  In re Gorfkle, 444 A. 2d 934, 939 (D. C. 1982); In re Thompson, 454 A. 2d 1324, 1326 (D. C. 1982).  Neither of those elements is necessarily satisfied by proof that a defendant has committed the substantive offenses of assault or drug distribution.  Likewise, no element of either of those substantive offenses is necessarily satisfied by proof that a defendant has been found guilty of contempt of court. Justice Scalia grounds his departure from Blockburger `s customary focus on the statutory elements of the crimes charged on <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Oklahoma, supra</citedDecision> , an improbable font of authority.  See ante, at 698.  A summary reversal, like <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> , "does not enjoy the full precedential value of a case argued on the merits." Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U. S. 1, 12, n. 4 (1991); accord, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 671 (1974).  Today's decision shows the pitfalls inherent in reading too much into a "terse per curiam.  " Ante, at 698.  Justice Scalia's discussion of <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> is nearly as long as <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> itself and consists largely of a quote, not from <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> , but from a subsequent opinion analyzing <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> .  Justice Scalia then concludes that <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> somehow requires us to look to the facts that must be proved under the particular court orders in question (rather than under the general law of criminal contempt) in determining whether contempt and the related substantive offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes.  This interpretation of <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> is both unprecedented and mistaken.  Our double jeopardy cases applying Blockburger have focused on the statutory elements of the offenses charged, not *717 on the facts that must be proved under the particular indictment at issuean indictment being the closest analogue to the court orders in this case. See, e. g., Grady, 495 U. S., at 528 (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("Th[e] test focuses on the statutory elements of the two crimes with which a defendant has been charged, not on the proof that is offered or relied upon to secure a conviction"); Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S. 333, 338 (1981) ("`[T]he Court's application of the test focuses on the statutory elements of the offense' " (quoting Iannelli v. United States, 420 U. S. 770, 785, n. 17 (1975))); United States v. Woodward, 469 U. S. 105, 108 (1985) (per curiam) (looking to the statutory elements of the offense in applying Blockburger ).  By focusing on the facts needed to show a violation of the specific court orders involved in this case, and not on the generic elements of the crime of contempt of court, Justice Scalia's double jeopardy analysis bears a striking resemblance to that found in Grady not what one would expect in an opinion that overrules Grady .  Close inspection of the crimes at issue in <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> reveals, moreover, that our decision in that case was not a departure from Blockburger `s focus on the statutory elements of the offenses charged.  In <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> , we held that a conviction for felony murder based on a killing in the course of an armed robbery foreclosed a subsequent prosecution for robbery with a firearm.  Though the felony-murder statute in <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> did not require proof of armed robbery, it did include as an element proof that the defendant was engaged in the commission of some felony.  Harris v. State, 555 P. 2d 76, 80 (Okla. Crim. App. 1976).  We construed this generic reference to some felony as incorporating the statutory elements of the various felonies upon which a felony-murder conviction could rest. Cf. Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684, 694 (1980).  The criminal contempt provision involved here, by contrast, contains no such generic reference which by definition incorporates the statutory elements of assault or drug distribution.  *718 Unless we are to accept the extraordinary view that the three-paragraph per curiam in Harris was intended to overrule sub silentio our previous decisions that looked to the statutory elements of the offenses charged in applying Blockburger , we are bound to conclude, as does Justice Scalia, see ante, at 698, that the ratio decidendi of our Harris decision was that the two crimes there were akin to greater and lesser included offenses.  The crimes at issue here, however, cannot be viewed as greater and lesser included offenses, either intuitively or logically.  A crime such as possession with intent to distribute cocaine is a serious felony that cannot easily be conceived of as a lesser included offense of criminal contempt, a relatively petty offense as applied to the conduct in this case. See D. C. Code Ann. § 33-541(a)(2)(A) (Supp. 1992) (the maximum sentence for possession with intent to distribute cocaine is 15 years in prison).
**Combined Opinion**
 Justice Blackmun, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.  I cannot agree that contempt of court is the "same offence" under the Double Jeopardy Clause as either assault with intent to kill or possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it.  I write separately to emphasize two interrelated points.  I I agree with Justice Souter that "the Blockburger test is not the exclusive standard for determining whether the rule against successive prosecutions applies in a given case." Post, at 756.  I also share both his and Justice White's dismay that the Court so cavalierly has overruled a precedent that is barely three years old and that has proved neither unworkable nor unsound.  I continue to believe that Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), was correctly decided, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a subsequent criminal prosecution where the proof required to convict on the later offense would require proving conduct that constitutes an offense for which a defendant already has been prosecuted.  If this were a case involving successive prosecutions under the substantive criminal law (as was true in Harris v. Oklahoma, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 682</citedDecision> (1977), Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410 (1980), and Grady ), I would agree that the Double Jeopardy *742 Clause could bar the subsequent prosecution.  But we are concerned here with contempt of court, a special situation.  We explained in Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U. S. 787 (1987): "The fact that we have come to regard criminal contempt as `a crime in the ordinary sense,' [ Bloom v. Illi- nois, 391 U. S. 194, 201 (1968)], does not mean that any prosecution of contempt must now be considered an execution of the criminal law in which only the Executive Branch may engage.  .  .  .  That criminal procedure protections are now required in such prosecutions should not obscure the fact that these proceedings are not intended to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws.
**Combined Opinion**
 [C]onviction for adultery required proof that the defendant had sexual intercourse with one woman while married to another; conviction for cohabitation required proof that the defendant lived with more than one woman at the same time.  Nonetheless, the Court .  .  .  held the separate offenses to be the `same.' " Ibid. In the past 20 years the Court has addressed just this problem of successive prosecution on three occasions.  In Harris v. Oklahoma, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 682</citedDecision> (1977) (per curiam) , we held that prosecution for a robbery with firearms was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause when the defendant had already been convicted of felony murder comprising the same robbery with firearms as the underlying felony.  Of course the elements of the two offenses were different enough to permit more than one punishment under the Blockburger test: felony murder required the killing of a person by one engaged in the commission of a felony, see 21 Okla. Stat., Tit. 21, § 701 (1971); robbery with firearms required the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery, see §§ 801, 791.  Harris v. State, 555 P. 2d 76, 80 (Okla. Crim. App. 1976), rev'd, 433 U. S. 682 (1977).  In Harris, however, we held that "[w]hen, as here, conviction of a greater crime, murder, cannot be had without conviction of the lesser crime, robbery with firearms, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for the lesser crime after conviction of the greater one." We justified that conclusion in the circumstances of the case by quoting Nielsen `s explanation of the Blockburger test's insufficiency for determining when a successive prosecution was barred.  "`[A] person [who] has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 ." 447 U. S., at 419-420 .  But that was not all. Writing for the Court, Justice White went on to say that, "[i]n any event, it may be that to sustain its manslaughter case the State may find it necessary *757 to prove a failure to slow or to rely on conduct necessarily involving such failure .  .  .  .  In that case, because Vitale has already been convicted for conduct that is a necessary element of the more serious crime for which he has been charged, his claim of double jeopardy would be substantial under Brown and our later decision in Harris v. Oklahoma, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 682</citedDecision> (1977)." Id., at 420.  Over a decade ago, then, we clearly understood Harris to stand for the proposition that when one has already been tried for a crime comprising certain conduct, a subsequent prosecution seeking to prove the same conduct is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  [8] This is in no way inconsistent with Vitale `s description of Harris as "treat[ing] a killing in the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense, and the robbery as a species of lesser-included offense." 447 U. S., at 420 .  The very act of "treating" it that way was a departure from straight Blockburger analysis; it was the same departure taken by the Nielsen Court. Vitale read Harris (which itself quoted Nielsen ) to hold that even if the Blockburger test were satisfied, a second prosecution would not be permitted for conduct comprising the criminal act charged in the first.  Nielsen and Harris used the word "incident," while Vitale used the word "conduct," but no matter which word is used to describe the unlawful activity for which one cannot again be forced to stand trial, the import of this successive-prosecution strand of our double jeopardy jurisprudence is clear.
**Combined Opinion**
 [18]  We do not address the motion to dismiss the threat counts based on collateral estoppel, see Ashe v. Swenson, supra , because neitherlower court ruled on that issue.  [19]  Justices White, Stevens, and Souter concur in this portion of the judgment.  [1]  Justice Blackmun concurs only in the judgment with respect to this portion.  [2]  Justice Scalia suggests that the dicta in those earlier cases are of limited value in light of Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194 (1968), which held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial applies to nonsummary contempt prosecutions.  But there is simply no reason to think that the dicta in those cases were based on the understanding that prosecutions for contempt were not subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Rather, the principal theme running through the pre- Grady cases is that, while nonsummary contempt is a criminal prosecution, that prosecution and the later one for a substantive offense involve two separate and distinct offenses.  [3]  The Court's discussion of the use of the contempt power at common law and in 19th-century America, see ante, at 694-695, does not undercut the relevance of these later, pre- Grady decisionsmost of which are from the late 20th centuryto the instant case. [1]  Assuming, arguendo, that Justice Scalia's reading of Harris v. Oklahoma, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 682</citedDecision> (1977), is accurate, and that we must look to the terms of the particular court orders involved, I believe Justice Scalia is correct in differentiating among the various counts in Foster.  The court order there provided that Foster must "`not molest, assault, or in any manner threaten or physically abuse' " his estranged wife.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.  For Foster to be found in contempt of court, his wife need have proved only that he had knowledge of the court order and that he assaulted or threatened her, but not that he assaulted her with intent to kill (Count V) or that he threatened to inflict bodily harm (Counts IIIV).  So the crime of criminal contempt in Foster, even if analyzed under Justice Scalia's reading of Harris, is nonetheless a different offense under Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), than the crimes alleged in Counts IIV of the indictment, since "each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not." Id., at 304 .  Because Justice Scalia finds no double jeopardy bar with respect to those counts, I agree with the result reached in Part IIIB of his opinion.
**Combined Opinion**
 See Brief for United States 26 (describing the order not to "assault or in any manner threaten" as "direct[ing] Foster .  .  .  to refrain from engaging in criminal conduct").  In any event, even assuming that the prohibition in the court order referred to threats other than those already outlawed, that should not change the outcome of this case. The offense prohibited in the CPOto threaten "in any manner"at the very least is "an incident and part of," In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176, 187 (1889),the offense of criminal threat defined in § 22-2307.  Therefore, for reasons explained below, prosecution for one should preclude subsequent prosecution for the other.  [9]  Therefore, I obviously disagree with The Chief Justice's Blockburger analysis which would require overruling not only Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), but, as Justice Scalia explains, Harris v. Oklahoma, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 682</citedDecision> (1977), as well.  See ante, at 698.  At the very least, where conviction of the crime of contempt cannot be had without conviction of a statutory crime forbidden by court order, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for the latter after acquittal or conviction of the former.  [10]  Similar results follow, of course, from The Chief Justice's interpretation of the Clause.  [1]  Justice Scalia's dismissal of this concern is difficult to follow.  As I understand it, he maintains that no double jeopardy problem exists because under Blockburger a conviction for assault would not be upheld.  See ante, at 702, n. 7.
**Combined Opinion**
[7]  Our cases, of course, hold that the same protection inheres after an acquittal.  See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969).  [8]  In Brown we recognized that "[a]n exception may exist where the State is unable to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset because the additional facts necessary to sustain that charge have not occurred or have not been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence." 432 U. S., at 169, n. 7 .  [9]  It is true that in light of its decision to remand the case to provide the State further opportunity to put forward some other basis for its prosecution, the Vitale Court, appropriately, described the claim only as "substantial." The important point, however, is the way in which the Court in Vitale (and, for that matter, the dissent in that case, see 447 U. S., at 426 (opinion of Stevens, J.)) read the Harris opinion.  [10]  Indeed, at least where the common elements of the offenses themselves describe a separate criminal offense, the Court's reading of Harris v. Oklahoma, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 682</citedDecision> (1977), is apparently inconsistent even with the historical understanding of the Clause put forward by three of the dissenters in Grady .  See Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508, 531 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting 1 T. Starkie, Criminal Pleading, ch. xix, pp. 322-323 (2d ed. 1822)) ("`[I]f one charge consist of the circumstances A. B. C. and another of the circumstances A. D. E. then, if the circumstance which belongs to them in common does not of itself constitute a distinct substantive offence, an acquittal from the one charge cannot include an acquittal of the other' ") (emphasis supplied).  [11]  I agree, therefore, with Justice White that the element of knowledge of a court order is irrelevant for double jeopardy purposes.  See ante, at 734 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  []  I note that atleast the charge concerning assault with intent to kill would apparently have been barred under the approach taken in Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in Grady .  See n. 9, supra.
