  ""rationale"": ""The Acting Case discusses the Target Case and its implications for state regulatory authority over Indian off-reservation usufructuary activities. However, the Acting Case does not explicitly or implicitly overrule the Target Case. Instead, it distinguishes the language of the treaty in the Target Case from the language of the treaty at issue in the Acting Case, suggesting that the conservation necessity standard may not apply in the same way. The Acting Case also notes that the Target Case has been cited in support of the proposition that States may enforce against Indians in their exercise of off-reservation usufructuary activities only those regulations necessary for purposes of conservation, but it does not reject or overturn this proposition.""
