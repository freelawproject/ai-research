Mr. Justice White, with whom The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist join, concurring in the judgment.  In Furman v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S. 238</citedDecision> (1972), this Court held the death penalty as then administered in Georgia to be unconstitutional.  That same year the Georgia Legislature enacted a new statutory scheme under which the death penalty may be imposed for several offenses, including murder.  The issue in this case is whether the death penalty imposed for murder on petitioner Gregg under the new Georgia statutory scheme may constitutionally be carried out.  I agree that it may.  I Under the new Georgia statutory scheme a person convicted of murder may receive a sentence either of death or of life imprisonment.  Ga. Code Ann. § 26-1101 (1972) , 1 Under Georgia Code Ann. §26-3102 (Supp. *208 1975), the sentence will be life imprisonment unless the jury at a separate evidentiary proceeding immediately following the verdict finds unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt at least one statutorily defined “aggravating circumstance.” 2 The aggravating circumstances are: “(1) The offense of murder, rape, armed robbery, *209 or kidnapping was committed by a person with a prior record of conviction for a capital felony, or the offense of murder was committed by a person *210 who has a substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions.  “(2) The offense of murder, rape, armed robbery, or kidnapping was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another capital felony or aggravated battery, or the offense of murder was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of burglary or arson in the first degree.

 In that event, the sentence as to counts one and three, those are the counts wherein the defendant was found guilty of murder, the sentence could be imprisonment for life.” Tr. 476-477.  The jury returned the death penalty on all four counts finding all the aggravating circumstances submitted to it, except that it did not find the crimes to have been “outrageously or wantonly vile,” etc. On appeal the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the death sentences on the murder counts and vacated the death sentences on the robbery counts.  233 Ga. 117 , 210 S. E. 2d 659 (1974).  It concluded that the murder sentences were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; that the evidence supported the finding of a statutory aggravating factor with respect to the murders; and, citing several cases in which the death penalty had been imposed previously for murders of persons who had witnessed a robbery, held: “After considering both the crimes and the defendant and after comparing the evidence and the sentences in this case with those of previous murder cases, we are also of the opinion that these two sentences of death are not excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases *219 which are hereto attached.” 5 Id., at 127 , 210 S. E. 2d, at 667 .  However, it held with respect to the robbery sentences: “Although there is no indication that these two *220 sentences were imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, the sentences imposed here are unusual in that they are rarely imposed for this offense.  Thus, under the test provided by statute for comparison (Code Ann. §27-2537 (c), (3)), they must be considered to be excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.” Ibid. Accordingly, the sentences on the robbery counts were vacated.  Ill The threshold question in this case is whether the death penalty may be carried out for murder under the Georgia legislative scheme consistent with the decision in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, supra.</citedDecision> In <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , this Court held that as a result of giving the sentencer unguided discretion to impose or not to impose the death penalty for murder, the penalty was being imposed discrimina- *221 torily, 6 wantonly and freakishly, 7 and so infrequently 8 that any given death sentence was cruel and unusual.  Petitioner argues that, as in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , the jury is still the sentencer; that the statutory criteria to be considered by the jury on the issue of sentence under Georgia’s new statutory scheme are vague and do not purport to be all-inclusive; and that, in any event, there are no circumstances under which the jury is required to impose the death penalty.  9 Consequently, the petitioner argues that the death penalty will inexorably be imposed in as discriminatory, standardless, and rare a manner as it was imposed under the scheme declared invalid in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> .  The argument is considerably overstated.  The Georgia Legislature has made an effort to identify those aggravating factors which it considers necessary and relevant to the question whether a defendant convicted of capital murder should be sentenced to death.  10 The *222 jury which imposes sentence is instructed on all statutory aggravating factors which are supported by the evidence, and is told that it may not impose the death penalty unless it unanimously finds at least one of those factors to have been established beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Georgia Legislature has plainly made an effort to guide the jury in the exercise of its discretion, while at the same time permitting the jury to dispense mercy on the basis of factors too intangible to write into a statute, and I cannot accept the naked assertion that the effort is bound to fail.  As the types of murders for which the death penalty may be imposed become more narrowly defined and are limited to those which are particularly serious or for which the death penalty is peculiarly appropriate as they are in Georgia by reason of the aggravating-circumstance requirement, it becomes reasonable to expect that juries — even given discretion not to impose the death penalty — will impose the death penalty in a substantial portion of the cases so defined.  If they do, it can no longer be said that the penalty is being imposed wantonly and freakishly or so infrequently that it loses its usefulness as a sentencing device.  There is, therefore, reason to expect that Georgia’s current system would escape the infirmities which invalidated its previous system under <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> .  However, the Georgia Legislature was not satisfied with a system which might, but also might not, turn out in practice to result in death sentences being imposed with reasonable consistency for certain serious murders.  Instead, it gave the Georgia Supreme Court the power and the obligation to perform precisely the task which three Justices of this Court, whose opinions were necessary to the result, performed *223 .in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> : namely, the task of deciding whether in fact the death penalty was being administered for any given class of crime in a discriminatory, standardless, or rare fashion.  In considering any given death sentence on appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court is to determine whether the sentence imposed was consistent with the relevant statutes — i.  e., whether there was sufficient evidence to support the finding of an aggravating circumstance.  Ga. Code Ann. §27-2537 (c)(2) (Supp. 1975).  However, it must do much more than determine whether the penalty was lawfully imposed.  It must go on to decide — after reviewing the penalties imposed in “similar cases”— whether the penalty is “excessive or disproportionate” considering both the crime and the defendant.  § 27-2537 (c)(3) (Supp. 1975).

 Similarly, the Georgia Supreme Court has determined that juries impose the death sentence too rarely with respect to certain classes of rape.  Compare Coley v. State, 231 Ga. 829 , 204 S. E. 2d 612 (1974), with Coker v. State, 234 Ga. 555 , 216 S. E. 2d 782 (1975).  However, it concluded that juries “generally throughout the state” have imposed the death penalty for those who murder witnesses to armed robberies.  Jarrell v. State, 234 Ga. 410, 425 , 216 S. E. 2d 258, 270 .  (1975).  Consequently, it affirmed the sentences in this case on the murder counts.  If the Georgia Supreme Court is correct with respect to this factual judgment, imposition of the death penalty in this and similar cases is consistent with <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> .  Indeed, if the Georgia Supreme Court properly performs the task assigned to it under the Georgia statutes, death sentences imposed for discriminatory reasons or wantonly or freakishly for any given category of crime will be set aside.  Petitioner has wholly failed to establish, and has not even attempted to establish, that the Georgia Supreme Court failed properly to perform its task in this case or that it is incapable of performing its task adequately in all cases; and this Court should not assume that it did not do so. Petitioner also argues that decisions made by the prosecutor — either in negotiating a plea to some lesser offense than capital murder or in simply declining to charge capital murder — are standardless and will inexorably result in the wanton and freakish imposition of the penalty condemned by the judgment in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> .  I address this *225 point separately because the cases in which no capital offense is charged escape the view of the Georgia Supreme Court and are not considered by it in determining whether a particular sentence is excessive or disproportionate.  Petitioner’s argument that prosecutors behave in a standardless fashion in deciding which cases to try as capital felonies is unsupported by any facts.  Petitioner simply asserts that since prosecutors have the power not to charge capital felonies they will exercise that power in a standardless fashion.  This is untenable.  Absent facts to the contrary, it cannot be assumed that prosecutors will be motivated in their charging decision by factors other than the strength of their case and the likelihood that a jury would impose the death penalty if it convicts.  Unless prosecutors are incompetent in their judgments, the standards by which they decide whether to charge a capital felony will be the same as those by which the jury will decide the questions of guilt and sentence.

 This cannot be accepted as a proposition of constitutional law. Imposition of the death penalty is surely an awesome responsibility for any system of justice and those who participate in it.  Mistakes will be made and discriminations will occur which will be difficult to explain.  However, one of society’s most basic tasks is that of protecting the lives of its citizens and one of the most basic ways in which it achieves the task is through criminal laws against murder.  I decline to interfere with the manner in which Georgia has chosen to enforce such laws on what is simply an assertion of lack of faith in the ability of the system of justice to operate in a fundamentally fair manner.  IV For the reasons stated in dissent in Roberts v. Louisiana, post, at 350-356, neither can I agree with the petitioner’s other basic argument that the death penalty, however imposed and for whatever crime, is cruel and unusual punishment.  I therefore concur in the judgment of affirmance.  Statement of The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist: We concur in the judgment and join the opinion of Mr. Justice White, agreeing with its analysis that Georgia’s system of capital punishment comports with *227 the Court’s holding in Furman v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S. 238</citedDecision> (1972).  Section 26-1101 provides as follows: “Murder.  “(a) A person commits murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied, causes the death *208 of another human being.  Express malice is that deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature, which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof.  Malice shall be implied where no considerable provocation appears, and where all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.  “(b) A person also commits the crime of murder when in the commission of a felony he causes the death of another human being, irrespective of malice.  “(o) A person convicted of murder shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for life.” The death penalty may also be imposed for kidnaping, Ga. Code Ann, §26-1311; armed robbery, §26-1902; rape, §26-2001; treason, §26-2201; and aircraft hijacking, §26-3301.

 The comparison involved a search for similarities in addition to the similarity of offense charged and sentence imposed.  “All of the murder cases selected for comparison involved mur *220 ders wherein all of the witnesses were killed or an attempt was made to kill all of the witnesses, and kidnapping eases where the victim was killed or seriously injured.  “The cases indicate that, except in some special circumstance such as a juvenile or an accomplice driver of a get-away vehicle, where the murder was committed and trial held at a time when the death penalty statute was effective, juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty.  The death penalty has also been imposed when the kidnap victim has been mistreated or seriously injured.  In this case the victim was murdered.  “The cold blooded and callous nature of the offenses in this case are the types condemned by death in other cases. This defendant's death sentences for murder and kidnapping are not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Using the standards prescribed for our review by the statute, we conclude that the sentences of death imposed in this case for murder and kidnapping were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.” Jarrell v. State, 234 Ga. 410, 425-426 , 216 S. E. 2d 258, 270 (1975).  See <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 240</citedDecision> (Douglas, J., concurring).  See <citedDecision>id., at 306</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., concurring).  See <citedDecision>id., at 310</citedDecision> (White, J., concurring).  Petitioner also argues that the differences between murder — for which the death penalty may be imposed — and manslaughter — -for which it may not be imposed- — -are so difficult to define and the jury’s ability to disobey the trial judge’s instructions so unfettered that juries will use the guilt-determination phase of a trial arbitrarily to convict some,of a capital offense while convicting similarly situated individuals only of noncapital offenses.  I believe this argument is enormously overstated.  However, since the jury has discretion not to impose the death penalty at the sentencing phase of a case in Georgia, the problem of offense definition and jury nullification loses virtually all its significance in this case. The factor relevant to this case is that the “murder .  .  .  was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another capital felony.” The State in its brief refers to this type of murder as “witness-elimination” murder.
