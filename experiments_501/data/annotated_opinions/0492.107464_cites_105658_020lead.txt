 He went to Israel in 1950, and in 1951 he voluntarily voted in an election for the Israeli Knesset, the legislative body of Israel.  In 1960, when he applied for renewal of his United States passport, the Department of State refused to grant it on the sole ground that he had lost his American citizenship by virtue of § 401 (e) of the Nationality Act of 1940 which provides that a United States citizen shall “lose” his citizenship if he votes “in a political election in a foreign state.” 1 Petitioner then brought this declaratory judgment action in federal district court alleging that § 401 (e) violates both the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and § 1, cl. 1, of the Fourteenth Amendment 2 which grants American citizenship to persons like petitioner.  Because neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor any other provision of the Constitution expressly grants Congress the power to *255 take away that citizenship once it has been acquired, petitioner contended that the only way he could lose his citizenship was by his own voluntary renunciation of it.  Since the Government took the position that § 401 (e) empowers it to terminate citizenship without the citizen's voluntary renunciation, petitioner argued that this section is prohibited by the Constitution.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals, rejecting this argument, held that Congress has constitutional authority forcibly to take away citizenship for voting in a foreign country based on its implied power to regulate foreign affairs.  Consequently, petitioner was held to have lost his American citizenship regardless of his intention not to give it up.  This is precisely what this Court held in Perez v. Brownell, <citedDecision>356 U. S. 44</citedDecision> .  Petitioner, relying on the same contentions about voluntary renunciation of citizenship which this Court rejected in upholding § 401 (e) in <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> , urges us to reconsider that case, adopt the view of the minority there, and overrule it.  That case, decided by a 5-4 vote almost 10 years ago, has been a source of controversy and confusion ever since, as was emphatically recognized in the opinions of all the judges who participated in this case below.  3 Moreover, in the other cases decided with 4 and since 5 <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> , this Court has consistently invalidated on a case-by-case basis various other statutory sections providing for involuntary expatriation.  It has done so on various grounds and has refused to hold that citizens can be expatriated without their voluntary renunciation of *256 citizenship.  These cases, as well as many commentators, 6 have cast great doubt upon the soundness of <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> .  Under these circumstances, we granted certiorari to reconsider it, 385 U. S. 917 .  In view of the many recent opinions and dissents comprehensively discussing all the issues involved, 7 we deem it unnecessary to treat this subject at great length.  The fundamental issue before this Court here, as it was in <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> , is whether Congress can consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment enact a law stripping an American of his citizenship which he has never voluntarily renounced or given up.  The majority in <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> held that Congress could do this because withdrawal of citizenship is “reasonably calculated to effect the end that is within the power of Congress to achieve.” <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 60</citedDecision> .  That conclusion was reached by this chain of reasoning: Congress has an implied power to deal with foreign affairs as an indispensable attribute of sovereignty; this implied power, plus the Necessary and Proper Clause, empowers Congress to regulate voting by American citizens in foreign elections; involuntary expatriation is within the “ample scope” of “appropriate modes” Congress can adopt to effectuate its general regulatory power.  <citedDecision>Id., at *25757-60</citedDecision> .  Then, upon summarily concluding that “there is nothing in the .  .  .  Fourteenth Amendment to warrant drawing from it a restriction upon the power otherwise possessed by Congress to withdraw citizenship,” <citedDecision>id., at 58, n. 3</citedDecision> , the majority specifically rejected the “notion that the power of Congress to terminate citizenship depends upon the citizen’s assent,” <citedDecision>id., at 61</citedDecision> .  First we reject the idea expressed in <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> that, aside from the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress has any general power, express or implied, to take away an American citizen’s citizenship without his assent.  This power cannot, as <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> indicated, be sustained as an implied attribute of sovereignty possessed by all nations.  Other nations are governed by their own constitutions, if any, and we can draw no support from theirs. In our country the people are sovereign and the Government cannot sever its relationship to the people by taking away their citizenship.  Our Constitution governs us and we must never forget that our Constitution limits the Government to those powers specifically granted or those that are necessary and proper to carry out the specifically granted ones.  The Constitution, of course, grants Congress no express power to strip people of their citizenship, whether in the exercise of the implied power to regulate foreign affairs or in the exercise of any specifically granted power.  And even before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, views were expressed in Congress and by this Court that under the Constitution the Government was granted no power, even under its express power to pass a uniform rule of naturalization, to determine what conduct should and should not result in the loss of citizenship.  On three occasions, in 1794, 1797, and 1818, Congress considered and rejected proposals to enact laws which would describe certain conduct as resulting in expatriation.  8 On each occa *258 sion Congress was considering bills that were concerned with recognizing the right of voluntary expatriation and with providing some means of exercising that right.

 .  .  that Congress could not declare the acts which should amount to a renunciation of citizenship; otherwise there would have been no necessity for this last resort.  When it was settled that Congress could not declare that the acceptance of a pension or an office from a foreign Emperor amounted to a disfranchisement of the citizen, it must surely be conceded that they could not declare that any other act did.  The cases to which their powers before this amendment confessedly did not extend, are very strong, and induce a belief that Congress could not in any case declare the acts which should cause ‘a person to cease to be a citizen.’ The want of power in a case like this, where the individual has given the strongest evidence of attachment to a foreign potentate and an entire renunciation of the feelings and principles of an American citizen, certainly establishes the absence of all power to pass a bill like the present one.  Although the intention with which it was introduced, and the title of the bill declare that it is to insure and foster the right of the citizen, the direct and inevitable effect of the bill, is an assumption of power by Congress to declare that certain acts when committed shall amount to a renunciation of citizenship.” 31 Annals of Cong. 1038-1039 (1818).  *260 Congressman Pindall of Virginia rejected the notion, later accepted by the majority in <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> , that the nature of sovereignty gives Congress a right to expatriate citizens: “[Ajllegiance imports an obligation on the citizen or subject, the correlative right to which resides in the sovereign power: allegiance in this country is not due to Congress, but to the people, with whom the sovereign power is found; it is, therefore, by the people only that any alteration can be made of the existing institutions with respect to allegiance.” Id., at 1045.  Although he recognized that the bill merely sought to provide a means of voluntary expatriation, Congressman Lowndes of South Carolina argued: “But, if the Constitution had intended to give to Congress so delicate a power, it would have been expressly granted.  That it was a delicate power, and ought not to be loosely inferred, .  .  .  appeared in a strong light, when it was said, and could not be denied, that to determine the manner in which a citizen may relinquish his right of citizenship, is equivalent to determining how he shall be divested of that right.  The effect of assuming the exercise of these powers will be, that by acts of Congress a man may not only be released from all the liabilities, but from all the privileges of a citizen.

 .  *267 can affect citizenship acquired as a birthright, by virtue of the Constitution itself .... The Fourteenth Amendment, while it leaves the power, where it was before, in Congress, to regulate naturalization, has conferred no authority upon Congress to restrict the effect of birth, declared by the Constitution to constitute a sufficient and complete right to citizenship.” Id., at 703.  To uphold Congress’ power to take away a man’s citizenship because he voted in a foreign election in violation of § 401 (e) would be equivalent to holding that Congress has the power to “abridge,” “affect,” “restrict the effect of,” and “take .  .  .  away” citizenship.  Because the Fourteenth Amendment prevents Congress from doing any of these things, we agree with The Chief Justice’s dissent in the <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> case that the Government is without power to rob a citizen of his citizenship under § 401 (e).  23 Because the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment and of the expatriation proposals which preceded and followed it, like most other legislative history, contains many statements from, which conflicting inferences can be drawn, our holding might be unwarranted if it rested entirely or principally upon that legislative history.  But it does not.  Our holding we think is the only one that can stand in view of the language and the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, and our construction of that Amendment, we believe, comports more nearly than <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> with the principles of liberty and equal justice to all that the entire Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to guarantee.  Citizenship is no light trifle *268 to be jeopardized any moment Congress decides to do so under the name of one of its general or implied grants of power.  In some instances, loss of citizenship can mean that a man is left without the protection of citizenship in any country in the world — as a man without a country.  Citizenship in this Nation is a part of a cooperative affair.  Its citizenry is the country and the country is its citizenry.  The very nature of our free government makes it completely incongruous to have a rule of law under which a group of citizens temporarily in office can deprive another group of citizens of their citizenship.  We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to, and does, protect every citizen of this Nation against a congressional forcible destruction of his citizenship, whatever his creed, color, or race.  Our holding does no more than to give to this citizen that which is his own, a constitutional right to remain a citizen in a free country unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship.  <citedDecision>Perez</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Brownell</citedDecision> is overruled.

Although some of the opponents, believing that citizenship was derived from the States, argued that any power to prescribe the mode for its relinquishment rested in the States, they were careful to point out that “the absence of all power from the State Legislatures would not vest it in us.” Id., at 1039.
