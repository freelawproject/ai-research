**Concurrence Opinion**
 I would adhere to the rulings and I would hold that the States have an appropriate and legitimate concern with highway safety; that the means Arizona has adopted with respect to one in Adolfo’s position (that is, the driver whose negligence has caused harm to others and whose judgment debt based on that negligence remains unsatisfied) in its attempt to assure driving competence and care on the part of its licensees, as well as to protect others, is appropriate state legislation; and that the Arizona statute, like its Utah counterpart, despite the tangential effect upon bankruptcy, does not operate in derogation of the Bankruptcy Act or conflict with it to the extent it may rightly be said to violate the Supremacy Clause.  Other factors of significance are also to be noted: 1.  The Court struggles to explain away the parallel District of Columbia situation installed by Congress itself.  Section 40-464 of the D. C. Code Ann. (1967) in all pertinent parts is identical with Arizona’s § 28-1163 (B).  The only difference is in the final word, namely, “article” in the Arizona statute and “chapter” in the District’s.  The District of Columbia statute was enacted as § 48 of Pub. Law 365 of May 25, 1954, effective one year later, 68 Stat. 132 .  This is long after the Bankruptcy Act *665 was placed on the books and, indeed, long after this Court’s decision in Lewis v. Roberts, <citedDecision>267 U. S. 467</citedDecision> (1925), that a personal injury judgment is a provable claim in bankruptcy.  Surely, as the Court noted in Kesler, 369 U. S., at 173-174 , “Congress had no thought of amending the Bankruptcy Act when it adopted this law for the District of Columbia.” See Lee v. England, 206 F. Supp. 957 (DC 1962).  Congress must have regarded the two statutes as consistent and compatible, and cannot have thought otherwise for the last 35 years.  5 If the statutes truly are in tension, then I would suppose that the later one, that is, § 40-464, would be the one to prevail.  Gibson v. United States, 194 U. S. 182, 192 (1904).  But, if so, we then have something less than the “uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States” that Art. I, § 8, cl. 4, of the Constitution commands, for the law would be one way in Arizona (and, by the present overruling of Reitz and Kesler , in New York and in Utah) and the other way in the District of Columbia.  Unfortunately, such is the dilemma in which the Court’s decision today leaves us.
