App. 24-26.  To benefit from this clause, Mountain Gravel had to hire a subcontractor who had been certified as a small disadvantaged business by the SBA, a state highway agency, or some other certifying authority acceptable to the contracting officer.  Any of the three routes to such certification described aboveSBA's 8(a) or 8(d) program, or certification by a State *210 under the DOT regulationswould meet that requirement.  The record does not reveal how Gonzales obtained its certification as a small disadvantaged business.  After losing the guardrail subcontract to Gonzales, Adarand filed suit against various federal officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, claiming that the race-based presumptions involved in the use of subcontracting compensation clauses violate Adarand's right to equal protection.  The District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment.  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner, <citedDecision>790 F. Supp. 240</citedDecision> (1992).  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  16 F. 3d 1537 (1994).  It understood our decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448 (1980), to have adopted "a lenient standard, resembling intermediate scrutiny, in assessing" the constitutionality of federal race-based action.  16 F. 3d, at 1544.  Applying that "lenient standard," as further developed in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990), the Court of Appeals upheld the use of subcontractor compensation clauses.  16 F. 3d, at 1547.
**Combined Opinion**
 The majority's concept of "consistency" ignores a difference, fundamental to the idea of equal protection, between oppression and assistance.  The majority's concept of "congruence" ignores a difference, fundamental to our constitutional system, between the Federal Government and the States.  And the majority's concept of stare decisis ignores the force of binding precedent.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.  As this case worked its way through the federal courts prior to the grant of certiorari that brought it here, petitioner Adarand Constructors, Inc., was understood to have raised only one significant claim: that before a federal agency may exceed the goals adopted by Congress in implementing a race-based remedial program, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require the agency to make specific findings of *265 discrimination, as under Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), sufficient to justify surpassing the congressional objective.  See 16 F. 3d 1537 , 1544 (CA10 1994) ("The gravamen of Adarand's argument is that the CFLHD must make particularized findings of past discrimination to justify its race-conscious SCC program under Croson because the precise goals of the challenged SCC program were fashioned and specified by an agency and not by Congress"); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner, <citedDecision>790 F. Supp. 240, 242</citedDecision> (Colo. 1992) ("Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment seeks a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction against the DOT, the FHA and the CFLHD until specific findings of discrimination are made by the defendants as allegedly required by City of Richmond v. Croson "); cf. Complaint ¶ 28, App. 20 (federal regulations violate the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments by requiring "the use of racial and gender preferences in the award of federally financed highway construction contracts, without any findings of past discrimination in the award of such contracts").  Although the petition for certiorari added an antecedent question challenging the use, under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, of any standard below strict scrutiny to judge the constitutionality of the statutes under which respondents acted, I would not have entertained that question in this case. The statutory scheme must be treated as constitutional if Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448 (1980), is applied, and petitioner did not identify any of the factual premises on which Fullilove rested as having disappeared since that case was decided.  As the Court's opinion explains in detail, the scheme in question provides financial incentives to general contractors to hire subcontractors who have been certified as disadvantaged business enterprises (DBE's) on the basis of certain race-based presumptions.  See generally ante, at 206-208.  These statutes (or the originals, of which the current ones are reenactments) have previously been justified as providing *266 remedies for the continuing effects of past discrimination, see, e. g., Fullilove , supra, at 465-466 (citing legislative history describing SBA § 8(a) as remedial); S. Rep. No. 100-4, p. 11 (1987) (Committee Report stating that the DBE provision of STURAA was "necessary to remedy the discrimination faced by socially and economically disadvantaged persons"), and the Government has so defended them in this case, Brief for Respondents 33.  Since petitioner has not claimed the obsolescence of any particular fact on which the Fullilove Court upheld the statute, no issue has come up to us that might be resolved in a way that would render Fullilove inapposite.  See, e. g., 16 F. 3d, at 1544 ("Adarand has stipulated that section 502 of the Small Business Act .
