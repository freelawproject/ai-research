<author id="b486-5">MR. Justice Brewer,</author>
<p id="AIR">after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p id="b486-6">There are three principal questions in this case: First, did the Circuit Court have jurisdiction; second, was there a taking of the land within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment; and, third, if there was a taking, was the government subject to the obligation of making compensation therefor ?</p>
<p id="AayV">Did the Circuit Court have jurisdiction ? It may be premised that this question was not raised in the Circuit Court, nor was it presented to this court on the first argument but only upon the reargument. This omission on the part of the learned counsel for the government is certainly suggestive. Nevertheless as the question, now for the first time presented, is one of jurisdic- ’ tion it must be considered and determined. To sustain the challenge of jurisdiction it is insisted by the government that there was no implied contract, but simply tortious acts on the part of its officers, and <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>149 U. S. 593, and <em>Schillinger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>155 U. S. 163, are relied upon. Let us see what those cases were and what they decided. In the former the plaintiff sued to recover from the United States for the use and occupation of land for a lighthouse. The land upon which the lighthouse was built was submerged land in Chesa<page-number citation-index="1" label="459">*459</page-number>peake Bay. The government pleaded that it had a paramount right to the use of the land, and that pleaAvas demurred to. It was held that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction, and in the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Gray it was said, after referring to several cases (pp. 598-9):</p>
<blockquote id="b487-5">“ In <em>Langford </em>v. <em>United </em>States, it was accordingly adjudged that, when an officer of the United States took and held possession of land of a private citizen, under a claim that it belonged to the government, the United States could not be charged upon an implied obligation to pay for its use and occupation.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b487-6"><em>“ </em>It has since been held that if the United States appropriate to a public use land which they admit to be private property, they may be held, as upon an implied contract, to pay its value to the owner. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Great Falls Manufacturing Company, </em>112 U. S. 645, and 124 U. S. 581. It has likewise been held that the United States may be sued in the Court of Claims for the use of a patent for an invention, the plaintiff’s right in which they have acknowledged. <em>Hollister </em>v. <em>Benedict Manufacturing </em>Company, 113 U. S. 59; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>128 U. S. 262. But in each of these cases the title of the plaintiff was admitted, and in none of them was any doubt thrown upon the correctness of the decision in <em>Langford's </em>case. See <em>Schillinger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>24 C. Cl. 278.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b487-7">“ The case at bar is governed by <em>Langford's </em>case. It was not alleged in this petition, nor admitted in the plea, that the United States had ever in any way acknowledged any right of property in the plaintiff as against the United States. The plaintiff asserted a title in the land in question, with the exclusive right of building thereon, and claimed damages of the United States for the use and occupation of the land for a lighthouse. The United States positively and precisely pleaded that the ■ land was submerged under the waters of Chesapeake Bay, one of the navigable waters of the United States, and that the United States, ‘ under the law, for the purpose of a lighthouse, has a paramount right to its usé as against the plaintiff or any other person; ’ and the plaintiff demurred to this plea.”</blockquote>
<p id="b487-8">In the other case it appeared that the architect of the Capitol contracted with G. <em>W. </em>Cook for the laying of pavement in the <page-number citation-index="1" label="460">*460</page-number>Capitol grounds. The contractor in laying the pavement infringed, as petitioners claimed, upon rights granted to them by patent. Thereafter this suit was brought, not against the party guilty of the alleged infringement, but against the United States which had accepted the pavement in the construction of which, as petitioners claimed, the contractor had infringed upon their rights. In the opinion it was skid (p. 170):</p>
<blockquote id="b488-5">“Here the claimants never authorized the use of the patent right by the government; never consented to, but always protested against it, threatening to interfere by injunction or other proceedings to restrain such use. There was no act of Congress in terms directing, or even by implication suggesting, the use of the patent. No officer of the government directed its use, and the contract which was executed by Cook did not name or describe it. There was no recognition by the government or any of its officers of the fact that in the construction of the pavement there was any use of the patent, of that any appropriation was being made of claimant’s property. The government proceeded as though it .were acting only in the management of its own property and the exercise of its own rights, and without any trespass upon the rights of the claimants. There was no point in the whole transaction from its commencement to its close where the minds of the parties met or where there was anything in the semblance of an agreement. So not only does the petition count upon a tort, but also the findings show a tort. That is the essential fact underlying the transaction and upon-which rests every pretence of a right to recover. There was no suggestion of a waiver of the tort or a pretence of any implied contract until after the decision of the Court of Claims that it had no jurisdiction over an action to recover for the tort.”</blockquote>
<p id="b488-6">How different is the case at bar! The government did not deny the title of the plaintiffs. It averred in the answer simply that it had “ no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief,” but did not couple such averment with any denial, .nor did it pretend that it owned the property or had a paramount proprietary right to its possession. It did not put in issue the question of title, but rested upon a denial that the acts its offi<page-number citation-index="1" label="461">*461</page-number>cers bad done by its direction had overflowed the land and wrought the injury as alleged, or that such overflow and injury created an implied contract, and also upon the bar of the statute of limitations. Nowhere in the record did it set up any title to the property antagonistic to that claimed by the plaintiffs. It simply denied responsibility for what it had caused to be done, and pleaded that if it had ever been liable, the statute of limitations had worked a bar. No officer of the government, as in the <em>Langford </em>case, claimed that the property found by the court to he the property of the plaintiffs, belonged to the government. "While there was no formal admission of record that the land belonged to the plaintiffs, the case Avas tried alone upon the theory that the government could not be held responsible for A\hat it had done. It did not repudiate the actions of its officers and agents, but on the contrary in terms admitted that they acted by authority of Congress, and that all that they did Avas laAvfully done. So that if the overfloAV and destruction of this property Avas, as Ave shall presently inquire, a taking and appropriation Avithin the scope of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, the jurisdictional question noAV presented is Avhether such appropriation directed by Congress created an implied contract on tiie part of the government to pay for the Avalué of the property so appropriated. Let us see Avhat this court has decided. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Great Falls Manufacturing Company, </em>112 U. S. 645, Congress having made an appropriation therefor, a dam Avas constructed across the Potomac with the view of supplying the city of Washington Avith AArater. In the construction of such dam certain lands belonging to the plaintiff Avere taken, although such lands were not by the act of Congress specifically ordered to be taken. The property so taken not.having been paid for, plaintiff brought this action in the. Court of Claims to recover the value thereof, and it Avas held that the action might be maintained, and in the opinion it was said (p. 656):</p>
<blockquote id="b489-5">“ It seems clear that these property rights have -been held and used by the agents of the United States, under the sanction of legislative enactments by Congress; for, the appropriation of money specifically for the construction of the dam from the <page-number citation-index="1" label="462">*462</page-number>Maryland shore to Conn’s Island was, all the circumstances considered, equivalent to an express direction by the legislative and executive branches of the government to its officers to take this particular property for the public objects contemplated bjr the scheme for supplying the capital of the nation with wholesome water. The making of the improvements necessarily involves the taking of the property; and if, for the want of formal proceedings for its condemnation, to public use, the claimant was entitled, at the beginning of the work, to have the agents of the government enjoined from prosecuting it until provision was made for securing, in some way, payment of the compensation required by the Constitution — upon which question, we express no opinion — there is no sound reason why the claimant might not waive that right, and, electing to regard the action of the government as a taking under its sovereign right of eminent domain, demand just compensation. <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 91 U. S. 367, 374. In that view we are of opinion that the United States, having by its agents, proceeding under the authority of an act of Congress, taken the property of the claimant for public use, are under an obligation, imposed by the Constitution, to make compensation. The law will imply a promise to make the required compensation, where property to which the government asserts no title, is taken, pursuant to an act of Congress, as private property to be applied for public uses. Such an implication being consistent with the constitutional duty of the government, as well as with common justice, the claimant’s cause of action is one that arises out of implied contract, within the meaning of the statute which confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims of actions founded £ upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United States.’ ”</blockquote>
<p id="b490-5">In <em>Great Falls Manufacturing Company </em>v. <em>The Attorney General, </em>124 U. S. 581, an action, which, like the -preceding, grew out of provisions made by Congress to supply water to the city of Washington, and in which the relief sought was the removal of all structures on the premises, or if it should appear that the property had been legally condemned, the framing of an issue, triable by jury, to ascertain the plaintiff’s damages, and a judgment for the amount thereof, it was said, referring to the <page-number citation-index="1" label="463">*463</page-number>contention that there were certain defects in the proceedings taken by the government (p. 597):</p>
<blockquote id="b491-4">. “ Even if the Secretary’s survey and map, and the publication of the Attorney General’s notice did not, in strict law, justify the former in taking possession of the land and water rights in question, it was competent for the company to waive the tort, and proceed against the United States, as upon an implied contract, it appearing, as it does here, that the government recognizes and retains the possession taken in its behalf for the public purposes indicated in the act under which its officers have proceeded.”</blockquote>
<p id="b491-5">In <em>Hollister </em>v. <em>Benedict Manufacturing Company, </em>113 U. S. 59, an action by the assignees of a patent against a United States collector for infringement, the law is thus stated (p. 67):</p>
<blockquote id="b491-6">“ If the right of the patentee was acknowledged, and, without his consent, an officer of the government, acting under legislative authority, made use of the invention in the discharge of his official duties, it would seem to be a cleaf case of the exercise of the right of eminent domain, upon which the law would imply a promise of compensation, an action on which would lie within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, such as was entertained and sanctioned in the case of <em>The United States </em>v. <em>The Great Falls Manufacturing </em>Company, 112 U. S. 645.”</blockquote>
<p id="b491-7">In <em>United States </em>v. Palmer, 128 U. S. 262, an action in the Court of Claims by a patentee against the government to'recover upon an implied contract for the use of the patented invention, it appeared that the petitioner was the patentee of certain improvements in infantry equipments which were adopted by the Secretary of War as a part of the equipment of the infantry soldiers of the United States, and, sustaining the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, it was said (p. 269):</p>
<blockquote id="b491-8">“No tort was committed or claimed to have been committed. The government used the claimant’s improvements with his consent; and, certainly, with- .the expectation on his part of receiving a reasonable compensation for the license. This is not a claim for an infringement, but a claim of compensation for an authorized use — two things totally distinct in the law, as <page-number citation-index="1" label="464">*464</page-number>distinct as trespass on lands is from use and occupation under a lease.”</blockquote>
<p id="b492-4">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Berdan Fire-Arms Company, </em>156 U. S. 552, a judgment of the Court of Claims against the United States on an implied contract for the use of an improvement in breechloading firearms was sustained, although, there was no act of Congress expressly directing the use of such improvement. In the opinion it was said (p. 567):</p>
<blockquote id="b492-5">“ While the findings are not so specific and emphatic as to the assent of the government to the terms of any contract, yet we think they are sufficient. There was certainly no denial of the patentee’s rights to the invention ; no assertion on the part of the goverhment that the patent was wrongfully issued; no claim of a right to use the invention regardless of the patent; no disregard of all claims of the patentee, and no use, in spite of protest or remonstrance. Negatively, at least, the findings are clear. The government used the invention with the consent and express permission of the owner, and it did not, while so using it repudiate the title of such owner.”</blockquote>
<p id="b492-6">And then, after quoting from several of the findings, it was added (p. 569):</p>
<blockquote id="b492-7">“ The import of these findings is this: That the officers of the government, charged specially with the duty of superintending the manufacture of muskets, regarded Berdan as the inventor of this extractor-ejector ; that the difference between the spiral and fiat spring was an immaterial difference; that, therefore, they were using in the Springfield musket Berdan’s invention ; that thej used it with his permission as well as that of his as-signee, the petitioner, and that they used it with the understanding that the government would pay for such use as for other private property which it might take, and this, although they did not believe themselves to have the authority to agree upon the price.”</blockquote>
<p id="b492-8">The rule deducible from these cases is that when the government appropriates property which it does not claim as its owm it does so under an implied contract that it will pay the value of the property it so appropriates. It is earnestly contended in argument that the government had. a right to appropriate this <page-number citation-index="1" label="465">*465</page-number>property. This may be conceded, but there is a vast difference between a proprietary and a governmental right.. When the government owns property, or claims to own it, it deals with it as owner and by virtue of its ownership, and if an officer of the government takes possession of property under the claim that it belongs to the government (when in fact it does not) that may well be considered a tortious act on his part, for there can be no implication of an intent on the part of the government to pay for that which it claims to own. Yery different from this proprietary right of the government in respect to property which it owns is its governmental right to appropriate the property of individuals. All private property is held subject to the necessities of government. The right of eminent domain underlies all such rights of property. The government may také personal or real property whenever its necessities ór the exigencies of the occasion demand. So the contention that the government had a paramount right to appropriate this property may be conceded, but the Constitution in the Fifth Amendment guarantees that when this governmental right of appropriation — this asserted paramount right — is exercised it shall be attended by compensation.</p>
<p id="b493-4">The government may take real estate for a post office, a court house, a fortification or a highway; or. in time of war it may take merchant vessels and make them part of its naval force. But can this be done without an obligation to pay for the value of that which is so taken.and appropriated ? Whenever in the exercise of its governmental rights it-takes property, the ownership of'which it concedes to be in an individual, it impliedly promises to pay therefor. Such is the import of the cases cited as well as of many others.</p>
<p id="b493-5">The action which was taken, resulting in the overflow and injury to these plaintiffs, is not to be regarded as the personal act of the officers but as the act of the government. That which the officers did is admitted by the answer to have been done by authority of the government, and although there may have been’ no specific act of Congress directing, the appropriation of this property of the plaintiffs, yet if that which the officers of the government did, acting under its direction, resulted in an ap<page-number citation-index="1" label="466">*466</page-number>propriation it is to be treated as the act of the government. <em>South Carolina </em>v. Georgia, 93 U. S. 4, 13; <em>Wisconsin </em>v. Duluth, 96 U. S. 379; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Great Falls Manufacturing Company, supra.</em></p>
<p id="b494-5">Congress for many successive terms appropriated money for the improvement of the Savannah River. 21 Stat. 470, 480; 22 Stat. 194, 200; 23 Stat. 140; 24 Stat. 321, 331; 25 Stat. 413; 26 Stat. 442; 27 Stat. 101; 28 Stat. 351. These appropriations were in the river' and harbor bills, and were generally of so much money for improving the river, but some deserve special mention. Thus, in 21 Stat. 470, it was provided that “one thousand dollars may be applied to payment of damages for 'land taken for widening the channel opposite Savannah.” In 24 Stat. 331, the Secretary of War was directed to cause a survey to be made of the “ Savannah River from cross tides above Savannah to the bar, with a view to obtaining twenty-eight feet of water in the channel.” The appropriation in 25 Stat. 413 was for the improvement of the river, “ completing the present project and commencing the extended project contained in the report of Engineer for year ending June 30,1887.” And by the same statute, 431, among the matters referred to the Secretary of War for survey and examination was “ whether the damage to the Yernezobie Freshet Bank in 1887 was caused by the work at cross tides, and whether the maintenance of said bank is essential to the success of the work at cross tides, and what will be the cost of so constructing said bank as to confine the water of said river to its bed.” The report of the engineers for the year 1887, referred to in the section above quoted, shows that part of the work which was being done by the government was in the construction of training walls, and wing dams, by which the width of the waterway was reduced,.</p>
<p id="b494-6">Further, the same year, 25 Stat. 94, an act was passed, entitled “ An act to facilitate the prosecution of works projected for the improvement of rivers and harbors,” which authorized the. Secretary of War to commence proceedings “ for the acquirement by condemnation of any land, right of way, or material needed to enable him to maintain, operate or prosecute works for the improvement of rivers and harbors for which pro<page-number citation-index="1" label="467">*467</page-number>vision has been made by law; . . . <em>Provided, however, </em>That,when the owner of such land, right of way, or material shall fix a price for the same, which in the opinion of the Secretary of War, shall be reasonable, he may purchase the same at such price without further delay.”</p>
<p id="b495-4">Thus, beyond the effect of the admission in the answer, and beyond the presumption of knowledge which attends the action of all legislative bodies, it affirmatively appears not only that Congress was making appropriations from year to year for the improvement of the river, but also that it had express notice of damage to the banks along this very plantation; that the works which were being done by the engineers had in view the narrowing of the width of the waterway ; that land would be damaged as the result of those works, and 'that it authorized the Secretary of War to take proceedings in eminent domain to acquire the land, right of way and material which might be nec: essary for maintaining, operating or prosecuting works of river improvement, or, if the price could be agreed upon, to purchase the same.</p>
<p id="b495-5">This brings the case directly within the scope of the decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Great Falls Manufacturing Company, supra, </em>where, as here, there was no direction to take the particular property, but a direction to do that which resulted in a taking, and it was held that the owner might waive the right to insist on condemnation proceedings and sue to recover the value.</p>
<p id="b495-6">It does not appear that the plaintiffs took any action to stop the work done by the government, or protested against it. Their inaction and silence amount to an acquiescence — an assent to the appropriation by the government. In this respect the case, is not dissimilar to that of a landowner who, knowing that a railroad company has entered upon his land and is engaged in constructing its road without having complied with the statute in respect to condemnation, is estopped from thereafter maintaining either trespass or ejectment, but is limited to a recovery of compensation. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Northern Pacific Railroad, </em>158 U. S. 1, 11; <em>Northern Pacific Railroad </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>171 U. S. 260, and cases cited in the opinion.</p>
<p id="b495-7">The case, therefore, amounts to this: The plaintiffs alleged <page-number citation-index="1" label="468">*468</page-number>that they were the owners of certain real estate bordering on the Savannah River; that the government, in the exercise of its powers of eminent domain and regulation of,commerce, through officers and agents duly empowered thereto by acts of Congress, placed dams, training walls and other obstructions in the river in such manner as to hinder its natural flow and to raise its waters so as to overflow the land of plaintiffs, and overflow it to such an extent as to cause a total destruction of its value. The government, not denying the ownership of plaintiffs, admitted that the work which was done by their officers and agents was done by authority of Congress, but denied that those works had produced the alleged injury and destruction. "We are of opinion that under these pleadings and the issues raised thereby the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to inquire whether the acts done by the officers of the United States under the direction of Congress had resulted in such an overflow and injury of the plaintiff’s land as to render it absolutely valueless, and if thereby the property was, in contemplation of. law, taken and appropriated by the government, to render judgment against it for the value of the property so taken and' appropriated.</p>
<p id="b496-4">"Was there a taking? There was no proceeding in condemnation instituted by the government, no attempt in terms to take and appropriate the title. There was no adjudication that the fee had passed from the landowner to the government, and if either of these be an essential element in the taking of lands, within the scope of the Fifth Amendment, there was no taking.</p>
<p id="b496-5">Some question is made as to the meaning of the findings. It appears from the fifth finding, as amended, that a large portion of the land flooded was in its natural condition between high-water mark and low water mark, and was subject to overflow as the water passed from one stage to the other; that this natural overflow was stopped by an embankment, and in lieu thereof, by means of flood gates, the land was flooded and drained at the will of the owner. From, this it is contended that the only result of the raising of the level of the river by the government works was to take away the possibility of drainage. But findings nine and ten show that, both by seepage and <page-number citation-index="1" label="469">*469</page-number>percolation through the embankment, and an actual flowing upon the plantation above the obstruction, the water has been raised in the plantation about eighteen inches, that it is impossible to remove this overflow of water, and, as a consequence, the property has become an irreclaimable bog, unfit for the purpose of rice culture or any other known agriculture, and deprived of all value. It is clear from these findings that what was a valuable rice plantation has been permanently flooded, wholly destroyed in value, and turned into an irreclaimable bog; and this as the necessary result of the work which the government has undertaken. Does this amount to a taking ? The case of <em>Pumpelly </em>v. <em>Green Bay </em>Company, 13 Wall. 166, answers this question in the affirmative. And on the argument it was conceded by the learned counsel for the government (and properly conceded in view of the findings) that so far as respects the mere matter of overflow and injury there was no substantial distinction between the two cases. In that case the Green Bay Company, as authorized by statute, constructed a dam across Fox River, by means of which the land of Pumpelly was overflowed and rendered practically useless to him. There, as here, no proceedings had been taken to formally condemn the land. Referring to this it was said (p. 177):</p>
<blockquote id="b497-4">“ The argument of the defendant is that there is no <em>talcing </em>of the land Avithin the meaning of the constitutional provision, and that the damage is a consequential result of such use of a navigable stream as the government had a right to for the improvement of its navigation.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b497-5">“ It Avould be a Aery curious and unsatisfactory result, if in construing a provision of constitutional law, always understood to have been adopted for protection and security to the rights of the individual as against the government, and Avhich has received the commendation of jurists, statesmen, and commentators as placing .the just principles of the common law on that subject beyond the power of ordinary legislation to change or control them, it shall be held that if the government refrains from the absolute conversion of real property to the uses of the public it can destroy its value entiiely, can inflict irreparable and permanent injury to any extent, can,- in effect, subject it to <page-number citation-index="1" label="470">*470</page-number>total destruction without making any compensation, because, in the narrowest sense of that word, it is not <em>taken </em>for the public use. Such a construction would, per vert the constitutional provision into a restriction upon the rights of the citizen, as those rights stood at the common law, instead of the government, and make it an authority for invasion of private right under the pretext of the public good, which had no warrant in the laws or practices of our ancestors.”</blockquote>
<p id="b498-5">Reference was also made to the case of <em>Sinnickson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>2 Harr. (17 N. J. Law) 129, in respect to which it was said: “ The case is mainly valuable here as showing that overflowing land by backing the water on it was considered as ‘ taking ’ it within the meaning of the principle.” Again, on page 179, it was said: “ But there are numerous authorities to sustain the doctrine that a serious interruption to the common and necessary use of property may be, in the language of Mr. Angelí, in his Avork on Water Courses, equivalent to the taking of it, and that under the constitutional provisions it is not necessary that the land should be absolutely taken.” And in a foot-note the following authorities were cited: Angell on Water Courses, sec. 465a<em>; Hooker </em>v. <em>New Haven &amp; Northampton Co., </em>14 Connecticut, 146; <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Granite Bridge Corporation, </em>21 Pick. 344; <em>Canal Appraisers </em>v. <em>The People, </em>17 Wend. 571, 604; <em>Lackland v. North Missouri Railroad Co., </em>31 Missouri, 180; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Proprietors of Middlesex Canal, </em>12 Massachusetts, 466.</p>
<p id="ApNd">It is clear from these authorities that where the government by the construction of a dam or other public works so floods lands belonging to an individual as to substantially destroy their value there is a, taking within the scope of the Fifth Amendment. While the government does not directly proceed to appropriate the title, yet it takes away the use and value; when that is done it is of little consequence in whom the fee may be vested. Of course, it results from this that the proceeding must be regarded as an actual appropriation of the land, including the possession, the right of possession and the fee; and when the amount awarded as compensation is paid the title, the fee, with whatever rights may attach thereto— in this case those at least which belong to a riparian proprie<page-number citation-index="1" label="471">*471</page-number>tor — pass to the government and it becomes henceforth, the full owner.</p>
<p id="b499-4">Passing to the third question, it is contended that what was done by the government was done in improving the navigability of a navigable river, that it is given by the Constitution full control over such improvements, and that if in doing any work therefor injury results to riparian proprietors or others it is an injury which is purely consequential, and for which the government is not liable. But if aiyy one proposition can be considered as settled by. the decisions of this court.it is that, although in the discharge of its duties the government may' appropriate property, it cannot do so without being liable to the obligation cast by the Fifth Amendment of paying just compensation.</p>
<p id="b499-5">In <em>Monongahela Navigation Company </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 148 U. S. 312, 336, it was said :</p>
<blockquote id="b499-6">“ But like the other powers granted to Congress by the Constitution, the power to regulate commerce is subject to all the limitations imposed by such instrument, and among them is that of the Fifth Amendment we have heretofore quoted. Congress has supreme control over the regulation of commerce, but if, in exercising that supreme control, it deems it necessary to take private property, then it must proceed sublet to the limitations imposed by this Fifth Amendment, and can take only on payment of just compensation.”</blockquote>
<p id="b499-7">In that case Congress had passed an act for condemning what was known as “ the upper lock and dam of the Monongahela Navigation Company,” and provided “ that in estimating the sum to be paid by the United States, the franchise of said corporation to collect tolls should not be considered or estimated,” but we held that this proviso was beyond the power of Congress; that it could not appropriate the property of the navigation company without paying its full value, and that a part of that value consisted in the franchise to take tolls. So in the recent case of <em>Scranton </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>179 U. S. 141, 153, we repeated the proposition in these words:</p>
<blockquote id="b499-8"><em>“ </em>Undoubtedly compensation must be made or secured to the owner when that which is done is to be regarded as a taking <page-number citation-index="1" label="472">*472</page-number>of private property for public use within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution; and of course in its' exercise of the power to regulate commerce, Congress may not override the provision that just compensation must be made when private property is taken for public use.”</blockquote>
<p id="b500-4">It is true that á majority of the court held, in that case, that the destruction of access to land abutting on a navigable river by the construction by Congress of a pier on the submerged lands in front of the upland, was not. a taking of private property for public uses, but only an instance of consequential injury to the property of the riparian owner. But the right of compensation in case of a taking was conceded. There have been many cases in which a distinction has been drawn between the taking of property for public uses and a consequential injury to such property, by reason of some public work. In the one class the law implies a contract, a promise to pay for the property taken, which, if the taking was by the general government, will uphold an action in the Court of Claims; while in the other class there is simply a tortious act doing injury, over which the Court of Claims has no jurisdiction. Thus, in <em>Transportation Company </em>v. Chicago, 99 U. S. 635, the city, duly authorized by statute, constructed a tunnel along the line of La Salle street a.nd under the Chicago River. The company claimed that it was deprived of access to its premises by and during the construction. This deprivation was not permanent, but continued only during the time necessary to complete the tunnel, and it was held that there was no taking of the property, but only an injury, and that a temporary injury thereto. In the course of the opinion, after referring to the <em>Pumpelly </em>case, supra, and <em>Eaton </em>v. Boston, <em>Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad Company, </em>51 N. H. 504, we said (p. 642):</p>
<blockquote id="b500-5">“ In those cases, it was held that permanent flooding of private property may be regarded as a ‘taking.’ In those cases there was physical invasion of real estate of the private owner, and a practical ouster' of his possession. But in the present case there was no such invasion. No entry was made upon the plaintiff’s lot. All that was done was to render for a time its use more inconvenient.”</blockquote>
<p id="b501-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="473">*473</page-number><em>Chicago </em>v. Taylor, 125 U. S. 161, while recognizing and reaffirming the rule there laid down, was decided upon the ground that a new rule was established by the Illinois constitution of 1870, which provided that “private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation.” <em>Montana Company </em>v. <em>St. Louis Mining &amp;c. </em>Company, 152 U. S. 160, held that a mere order for inspection of mining property was not a taking thereof, because all that was done was a temporary and limited interruption of the exclusive use. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 166 U. S. 269, decided that, where by the construction of a dyke by the United States in the improvement of the Ohio River the plaintiff, a riparian owner, was through the greater part of the gardening season deprived of the use of her landing for the shipment of products from and supplies to her farm, whereby the value of her farm was reduced $150 to $200 per acre, there was no taking of the property, but only a consequential injury. See also <em>Marchant </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>Railroad, 153 U. S. 380; <em>Meyer </em>v. Richmond, 172 U. S. 82. In this connection <em>Mills </em>v. <em>United States, </em>46 Fed. Rep. 738, decided in the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, is worthy of notice by reason of its similarity in many respects and its clearly marked distinction in an essential matter. It was an action for injuries to a rice plantation on the banks of the Savannah River resulting from works done by the United States in improving the navigability of that river, apparently the very improvement made by the government in the present case. The condition of the claimant’s rice plantation prior to the'improvement was substantially that of these plaintiffs’ property, and the lands were drained by opening the gates when the river was at low water mark. The complaint was that the erection by the government of what was called the “cross tides dam,” running from the upper end of Hutchinson’s Island to the lower end of Argyle Island, cut off all the flow of water from the stream connecting the front and back rivers, raised both the high and low water levels in the front river, and not only destroyed the facilities for draining these lands into the front .river, but rendered it necessary to raise the levees around the rice fields, to prevent flooding the fields at high <page-number citation-index="1" label="474">*474</page-number>water. This, it was alleged, unfitted the lands for rice culture and made it necessary that new drainage into back river be provided where the water levels were suitable. Obviously, there was no taking of the plaintiff’s lands, but simply an injury which could be remedied at an expense as alleged of $10,000, and the action was one to recover the amount of this consequential injury. The court rightfully held that it could not be ■ sustained. Here there is no finding, no suggestion, that by any expense the flooding could be averted. We may, of course, know that there is theoretically no limit to that which engineering skill may accomplish. We know that vast tracts have in different parts of the world been reclaimed by levees and other works, and so we máy. believe that this flooding may be prevented, that some day all these submerged lands may be reclaimed. But as a practical matter, and for the purposes of this case, we must under the findings regard the lands in controversy as irreclaimable and their value wholly and finally destroyed.</p>
<p id="b502-5">Therefore, following the settled law of this court, we hold that there has been a taking of • the lands for public uses and that the government is under an implied contract to make just compensation therefor.</p>
