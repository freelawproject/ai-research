 Was it committed for money?  Was it committed upon a peace officer or judicial officer?  Was it committed in a particularly heinous way or in a manner that endangered the lives of many persons?  In addition, the jury's attention is focused on the characteristics of the person who committed the crime: Does he have a record of prior convictions for capital offenses?  Are there any special facts about this defendant that mitigate against imposing capital punishment ( e. g., his youth, the extent of his cooperation with the police, his emotional state at the time of the crime).  [49] As a result, while *198 some jury discretion still exists, "the discretion to be exercised is controlled by clear and objective standards so as to produce non-discriminatory application." Coley v. State, <citedDecision>231 Ga. 829, 834</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>204 S. E. 2d 612, 615</citedDecision> (1974).  As an important additional safeguard against arbitrariness and caprice, the Georgia statutory scheme provides for automatic appeal of all death sentences to the State's Supreme Court. That court is required by statute to review each sentence of death and determine whether it was imposed under the influence of passion or prejudice, whether the evidence supports the jury's finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and whether the sentence is disproportionate compared to those sentences imposed in similar cases. § 27-2537 (c) (Supp. 1975).  In short, Georgia's new sentencing procedures require as a prerequisite to the imposition of the death penalty, specific jury findings as to the circumstances of the crime or the character of the defendant.  Moreover, to guard further against a situation comparable to that presented in Furman , the Supreme Court of Georgia compares each death sentence with the sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants to ensure that the sentence of death in a particular case is not disproportionate.  On their face these procedures seem to satisfy the concerns of Furman .  No longer should there be "no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which [the death penalty] is imposed from the many cases in which it is not." 408 U. S., at 313 (WHITE, J., concurring).

 We think it desirable for the jury to have as much information before it as possible when it makes the sentencing decision.  See supra, at 189-190.  3 Finally, the Georgia statute has an additional provision designed to assure that the death penalty will not be imposed on a capriciously selected group of convicted defendants.  The new sentencing procedures require that the State Supreme Court review every death sentence to determine whether it was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, whether the evidence supports the findings of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and "[w]hether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant." § 27-2537 (c) (3) (Supp. 1975).  [56] In performing *205 its sentence-review function, the Georgia court has held that "if the death penalty is only rarely imposed for an act or it is substantially out of line with sentences imposed for other acts it will be set aside as excessive." Coley v. State, <citedDecision>231 Ga., at 834</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>204 S. E. 2d, at 616</citedDecision> .  The court on another occasion stated that "we view it to be our duty under the similarity standard to assure that no death sentence is affirmed unless in similar cases throughout the state the death penalty has been imposed generally .  .  .  ." Moore v. State, 233 Ga. 861, 864 , 213 S. E. 2d 829, 832 (1975).  See also Jarrell v. State, supra, at 425, 216 S. E. 2d, at 270 (standard is whether "juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty"); Smith v. State, 236 Ga. 12, 24 , 222 S. E. 2d 308, 318 (1976) (found "a clear pattern" of jury behavior).  It is apparent that the Supreme Court of Georgia has taken its review responsibilities seriously.  In <citedDecision>Coley</citedDecision> , it held that "[t]he prior cases indicate that the past practice among juries faced with similar factual situations and like aggravating circumstances has been to impose only the sentence of life imprisonment for the offense of rape, rather than death." <citedDecision>231 Ga., at 835</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>204 S. E. 2d, at 617</citedDecision> .  It thereupon reduced Coley's sentence from death to life imprisonment.  Similarly, although armed robbery is a capital offense under Georgia law, § 26-1902 (1972), the Georgia court concluded that the death sentences imposed in this case for that crime were "unusual in that they are rarely imposed for [armed robbery].  Thus, under the test provided by statute, .  .  .  they must be considered to be excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases." 233 *206 Ga., at 127, 210 S. E. 2d, at 667 .

 § 27-2537 (f) (Supp. 1975).  The court also has the obligation of determining whether the penalty was "imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor." § 27-2537 (c) (1) (Supp. 1975).  The Georgia Supreme Court has interpreted the appellate review statute to require it to set aside the death sentence whenever juries across the State impose it only rarely for the type of crime in question; but to require it to affirm death sentences whenever juries across the State generally impose it for the crime in question.  *224 Thus, in this case the Georgia Supreme Court concluded that the death penalty was so rarely imposed for the crime of robbery that it set aside the sentences on the robbery counts, and effectively foreclosed that penalty from being imposed for that crime in the future under the legislative scheme now in existence.  Similarly, the Georgia Supreme Court has determined that juries impose the death sentence too rarely with respect to certain classes of rape.  Compare Coley v. State, <citedDecision>231 Ga. 829</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>204 S. E. 2d 612</citedDecision> (1974), with Coker v. State, 234 Ga. 555 , 216 S. E. 2d 782 (1975).  However, it concluded that juries "generally throughout the state" have imposed the death penalty for those who murder witnesses to armed robberies.  Jarrell v. State, 234 Ga. 410, 425 , 216 S. E. 2d 258, 270 (1975).  Consequently, it affirmed the sentences in this case on the murder counts.  If the Georgia Supreme Court is correct with respect to this factual judgment, imposition of the death penalty in this and similar cases is consistent with Furman .  Indeed, if the Georgia Supreme Court properly performs the task assigned to it under the Georgia statutes, death sentences imposed for discriminatory reasons or wantonly or freakishly for any given category of crime will be set aside.  Petitioner has wholly failed to establish, and has not even attempted to establish, that the Georgia Supreme Court failed properly to perform its task in this case or that it is incapable of performing its task adequately in all cases; and this Court should not assume that it did not do so. Petitioner also argues that decisions made by the prosecutor either in negotiating a plea to some lesser offense than capital murder or in simply declining to charge capital murderare standardless and will inexorably result in the wanton and freakish imposition of the penalty condemned by the judgment in Furman .

 "In each of the comparison cases cited, the records show that the accused was found guilty of murder of the victim of the robbery or burglary committed in the course of such robbery or burglary.  In each of those cases, the jury imposed the sentence of death.  In Pass v. State, supra, the murder took place in the victim's home, as occurred in the case under consideration.  "We find that the sentence of death in this case is not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.  Code Ann. § 27-2537 (c) (3).  Notwithstanding the fact that there have been cases in which robbery victims were murdered and the juries imposed life sentences (see Appendix), the cited cases show that juries faced with similar factual situations have imposed death sentences.  Compare Coley v. State, <citedDecision>231 Ga. 829, 835</citedDecision> , supra. Thus the sentence here was not `wantonly and freakishly imposed' (see above)." Moore v. State, 233 Ga. 861, 865-866 , 213 S. E. 2d 829, 833 (1975).  In another case decided after the instant case the Georgia Supreme Court stated: "The cases reviewed included all murder cases coming to this court since January 1, 1970.  All kidnapping cases were likewise reviewed.  The comparison involved a search for similarities in addition to the similarity of offense charged and sentence imposed.  "All of the murder cases selected for comparison involved murders wherein all of the witnesses were killed or an attempt was made to kill all of the witnesses, and kidnapping cases where the victim was killed or seriously injured.  "The cases indicate that, except in some special circumstance such as a juvenile or an accomplice driver of a get-away vehicle, where the murder was committed and trial held at a time when the death penalty statute was effective, juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty.

[14]  In Furman , I considered several additional purposes arguably served by the death penalty.  408 U. S., at 314, 342, 355-358 .  The only additional purpose mentioned in the opinions in these cases is specific deterrencepreventing the murderer from committing another crime.  Surely life imprisonment and, if necessary, solitary confinement would fully accomplish this purpose.
