**Dissenting Opinion**
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Ste- vens and Justice O’Connor join, dissenting.  In Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., <citedDecision>294 U. S. 511</citedDecision> (1935), the Court held that a New York statute setting minimum prices for milk sold in that State violated the Commerce Clause when applied to milk produced more cheaply in Vermont but imported into New York for sale.  Today the Court applies the doctrine of that case to invalidate a Connecticut statute which sets a maximum price for beer imported into *346 Connecticut from other States.  The Court’s analysis seems wrong to me both as a matter of economics and as a matter of law: the maximum prices set by Connecticut in this case have a quite different effect than did the minimum prices set by New York in the <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> case, and by reason of the Twenty-first Amendment the States possess greater authority to regulate commerce in beer than they do commerce in milk.  The New York statute passed upon in <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> provided that no milk could be sold in the New York City metropolitan area unless it had been purchased from the producer for a price at least equal to the minimum specified by law. When this statute was applied to milk produced in Vermont but brought into the New York City metropolitan area for sale, the result was to require Vermont producers to give up the natural advantage which they would otherwise have obtained from the fact that the costs of production of milk in Vermont were lower than the costs of production in New York. The Court rightly held that this sort of a regulation violated the Commerce Clause because it “set a barrier to traffic between one state and another as effective as if customs duties, equal to the price differential, had been laid upon the thing transported.” <citedDecision>Id., at 521</citedDecision> .  In Milk Control Board v. Eisenberg Farm Products, 306 U. S. 346 (1939), decided four years after <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> , the Court upheld a different state milk price regulation, and in so doing distinguished <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> as a case in which “this Court condemned an enactment aimed solely at interstate commerce attempting to affect and regulate the price to be paid for milk in a sister state.” 306 U. S. at 353 .  The Connecticut statute here is markedly different from the New York statute condemned in <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> .  Connecticut has no motive to favor local brewers over out-of-state brewers, because there are no local brewers.  Ante, at 327, n. 2.  Its motive — unchallenged here — is to obtain from out-of-state brewers prices for Connecticut retailers and Connecticut beer drinkers as low as those charged by the brewers in neighboring States.  Connecticut does not seek to erect any *347 sort of tariff barrier to exclude out-of-state beer; its residents will drink out-of-state beer if they drink beer at all, and the State simply wishes its inhabitants to be treated as favorably as those of neighboring States by the brewers who sell interstate.  There is no “tariff wall” between Connecticut and other States; there is only a maximum price regulation with which the interstate brewer would rather not have to bother.  But that is not a sufficient reason for saying that such a regulation violates the Commerce Clause.
