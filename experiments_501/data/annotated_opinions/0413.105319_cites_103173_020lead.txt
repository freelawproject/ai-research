 And see Baldwin Co. v. Maner, - Ark. -, 273 S. W. 2d 28 .  While Carroll was receiving weekly payments under the Missouri Act, he decided to sue Lanza for common-law damages in the Arkansas courts.  Lanza had the case removed to the Federal District Court where judgment was rendered for Carroll.  2 116 F. Supp. 491 .  The Court of Appeals, while agreeing with the District Court that the judgment was sustainable as a matter of -Arkansas law, reversed on the ground that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution 3 (Art. IV, § 1) barred recovery.  216 F. 2d 808 .  The case is here by petition for certiorari which we granted ( 348 U. S. 870 ) because of doubts as to the correctness of the decision raised by Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission, <citedDecision>306 U. S. 493</citedDecision> .  The Court of Appeals thought Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, 320 U. S. 430 , to be controlling.  There the employee having received a final award for compensation *411 in the forum of the injury returned to his home State and sued to recover under its Compensation Act.  We held that the latter suit was precluded by the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  But here there was no final award under the Missouri Act.  Under that Act the statutory payments apparently start automatically on receipt of notice of the injury.  Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, §§ 287.380, 287.400.

 Rather we have the naked question whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause makes Missouri’s statute a bar to Arkansas’ common-law remedy.  A statute is a “public act” within the meaning of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  See Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145 , 154-155, and cases cited; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Commission, 294 U. S. 532 .  It was indeed held in the Clapper case that a Vermont Compensation Act, which purported to give an exclusive remedy, barred a common-law action on the same claim in the New Hampshire courts by a Vermont employee against a Vermont employer, even though the injury occurred in New Hampshire.  The Clapper case allowed a State to fix one exclusive remedy for personal injuries involving its residents, and required the other States to refuse to enforce any inconsistent remedy.  Thus, as respects persons residing or businesses located in a State, a remedy was provided employees that was “both expeditious and independent of proof of fault,” and a liability was imposed on employers that was “limited and determinate.” 286 U. S., at 159.  *412 Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission, <citedDecision>306 U. S. 493</citedDecision> , departed, however, from the Clapper decision.  There a resident of Massachusetts regularly employed in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts corporation was injured while doing temporary duty in California.  The Massachusetts Compensation Act purported to give an exclusive remedy, even for injuries incurred beyond its borders.  But California also had a Compensation Act which undertook to fix liability on employers, irrespective of any contract, rule, or regulation, a provision which the California courts strictly enforced.  The Court, therefore, held that the exclusive nature of the Massachusetts Act was “obnoxious” to the policy of California.  The Court proceeded on the premise, repeated over and again in the cases, that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require a State to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the statute of another State reflecting a conflicting and opposed policy.
