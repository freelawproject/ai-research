 These “benefits of public welfare legislation,” id., at 16 , extended in modern times to virtually every member of the population and valuable to every person and association, were the paradigms of advantages that religious organiza *875 tions could enjoy consistently with the prohibition against aid, and that governments could extend without deserting their required position of neutrality.  But paradigms are not perfect fits very often, and government spending resists easy classification as between universal general service or subsidy of favoritism.  The 5-to-4 division of the Everson Court turned on the inevitable question whether reimbursing all parents for the cost of transporting their children to school was close enough to police protection to tolerate its indirect benefit in some degree to religious schools, with the majority in Everson thinking the reimbursement statute fell on the lawful side of the line. Although the state scheme reimbursed parents for transporting children to sectarian schools, among others, it gave “no money to the schools.  It [did] not support them.  Its legislation [did] no more than provide a general program to help parents get their children, regardless of their religion, safely and expeditiously to and from accredited schools.” Id., at 18 .  The dissenters countered with factual analyses showing the limitation of the law’s benefits in fact to private school pupils who were Roman Catholics, id., at 20 (Jackson, J., dissenting), and indicating the inseparability of transporting pupils to school from support for the religious instruction that was the school’s raison d’etre, id., at 45-46 (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  Everson is usefully understood in the light of a successor case two decades later, Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 236</citedDecision> (1968), in which the challenged government practice was lending textbooks to pupils of schools both public and private, including religious ones (as to which there was no evidence that they had previously supplied books to their classes and some evidence that they had not, <citedDecision>id., at 244, n. 6</citedDecision> ).  By the time of <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> , the problem of classifying the state benefit, as between aid to religion and general public service consistent with government neutral *876 ity, had led to the formulation of a “test” that required secular, primary intent and effect as necessary conditions of any permissible scheme.  <citedDecision>Id., at 243</citedDecision> .  Again the Court split, upholding the state law in issue, but with Everson’s majority author, Justice Black, now in dissent.  What is remarkable about <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> today, however, is not so much its division as its methodology, for the consistency in the way the Justices went about deciding the ease transcended their different conclusions.  Neither side rested on any facile application of the “test” or any simplistic reliance on the generality or even-handedness of the state law. Disagreement concentrated on the true intent inferrable behind the law, the feasibility of distinguishing in fact between religious and secular teaching in church schools, and the reality or sham of lending books to pupils instead of supplying books to schools.  The majority, to be sure, cited the provision for books to all schoolchildren, regardless of religion, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 243</citedDecision> , just as the Everson majority had spoken of the transportation reimbursement as going to all, 330 U. S., at 16 , in each case for the sake of analogy to the provision of police and fire services.  5 But the stress was on the practical significance of the actual benefits received by the schools.  As Everson had rested on the understanding that no money and no support went to the school, id., at 18 , <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> emphasized that the savings to parents were devoid of any measurable effect in teaching religion, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 243-244</citedDecision> .  Justice Harlan, concurring, summed up the approach with his observations that the required government “[neutrality is ... a coat of many colors,” and quoted Justice Goldberg’s conclusion, that there was “ 'no simple and clear measure’... by which this or any [religious school aid] case may readily be decided,” <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 249 (quoting Schempp, 374 U. S., at 306 ).  *877 After Everson and <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> , the state of the law applying the Establishment Clause to public expenditures producing some benefit to religious schools was this: 1.  Government aid to religion is forbidden, and tax revenue may not be used to support a religious school or religious teaching.  2.  Government provision of such paradigms of universally general welfare benefits as police and fire protection does not count as aid to religion.  3.  Whether a law’s benefit is sufficiently close to universally general welfare paradigms to be classified with them, as distinct from religious aid, is a function of the purpose and effect of the challenged law in all its particularity.  The judgment is not reducible to the application of any formula.  Evenhandedness of distribution as between religious and secular beneficiaries is a relevant factor, but not a sufficiency test of constitutionality.  There is no rule of religious equal protection to the effect that any expenditure for the benefit of religious school students is necessarily constitutional so long as public school pupils are favored on ostensibly identical terms.  4.  Government must maintain neutrality as to religion, “neutrality” being a conclusory label for the required position of government as neither aiding religion nor impeding religious exercise by believers.  “Neutrality” was not the name of any test to identify permissible action, and in particular, was not synonymous with even-handedness in conferring benefit on the secular as well as the religious.  Today, the substantive principle of no aid to religious mission remains the governing understanding of the Establishment Clause as applied to public benefits inuring to religious schools.  The governing opinions on the subject in the 85 years since <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> have never challenged this principle.  The *878 eases have, however, recognized that in actual Establishment Clause litigation over school aid legislation, there is no pure aid to religion and no purely secular welfare benefit; the effects of the laws fall somewhere in between, with the judicial task being to make a realistic allocation between the two possibilities.  The Court’s decisions demonstrate its repeated attempts to isolate considerations relevant in classifying particular benefits as between those that do not discernibly support of threaten support of a school’s religious mission, and those that cross or threaten to cross the line into support for religion.  II A The most deceptively familiar of those considerations is “neutrality,” the presence or absence of which, in some sense, we have addressed from the moment of Everson itself.  I say “some sense,” for we have used the term in at least three ways in our cases, and an understanding of the term’s evolution will help to explain the concept as it is understood today, as well as the limits of its significance in .  Establishment Clause analysis.  “Neutrality’ has been employed as a term to describe the requisite state of government equipoise between the forbidden encouragement and discouragement of religion; to characterize a benefit or aid as secular; and to indicate evenhandedness in distributing it.  As already mentioned, the Court first referred to neutrality in Everson , simply stating that government is required “to be a neutral” among religions and between religion and nonreligion.  330 U. S., at 18 .. Although “neutral” may have carried a hint of inaction when we indicated that the First Amendment “does not require the state to be [the] adversary” of religious believers, ibid., or to cut off general government services from religious organizations, Everson provided no explicit definition of the term or further indication of what the government was required to do or not do to be *879 “neutral” toward religion.  In practical terms, “neutral” in Everson was simply a term for government in its required median position between aiding and handicapping religion.  The second major ease on aid to religious schools, <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> , used “neutrality” to describe an adequate state of balance between government as ally and as adversary to religion, see <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 242</citedDecision> (discussing line between “state neutrality to religion and state support of religion”).  The term was not further defined, and a few subsequent school cases used “neutrality” simply to designate the required relationship to religion, without explaining how to attain it.  See, e. g., Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 677 (1971) (describing eases that “see[k] to define the boundaries of the neutral area between [the Religion Clauses] within which the legislature may legitimately act”); Roemer v. Board of Public Works of Md., 426 U. S. 736,747 (1976) (plurality opinion of Blackmun, J.) (“Neutrality is what is required.  The State must confine itself to secular objectives, and neither advance nor impede religious activity.  Of course, that principle is more easily stated than applied”); see also Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 782 (1973) (describing “neutral posture” toward religion); Roemer, swpra, at 745-746 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (“The Court has enforced a scrupulous neutrality by the State, as among religions, and also as between religious and other activities”); cf. Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 254 (1977) (quoting Lemon and noting difficulty of religious teachers’ remaining “‘religiously neutral’ ”).  The Court began to employ “neutrality” in a sense different from equipoise, however, as it explicated the distinction between “religious” and “secular” benefits to religious schools, the latter being in some circumstances permissible.  See infra, at 884-899 (discussing considerations).  Even though both Everson and <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> had anticipated some such distinction, neither ease had used the term “neutral” in this way.  In Everson , Justice Black indicated that providing *880 police, fire, and similar government services to religious institutions was permissible, in part because they were “so separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function.” 330 U. S., at 18 .  <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> similarly focused on the fact that the textbooks lent out were “secular” and approved by secular authorities, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 245</citedDecision> , and assumed that the secular textbooks and the secular elements of education they supported were not so intertwined with religious instruction as “in fact [to be] instrumental in the teaching of religion,” <citedDecision>id., at 248</citedDecision> .  Such was the Court’s premise in Lemon for shifting the use of the word “neutral” from labeling the required position of the government to describing a benefit that was nonreligious.  We spoke of “[o]ur decisions from Everson to <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> [as] permitting] the States to provide church-related schools with secular, neutral, or nonideological services, facilities, or materials,” 403 U. S., at 616, and thereafter, we regularly used “neutral” in this second sense of “secular” or “nonreligious.” See, e. g., Tilton, supra, at 687-688 (characterizing subsidized teachers in Lemon as “not necessarily religiously neutral,” but buildings as “religiously neutral”); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 365-366 (1975) (describing instructional materials as “ ‘secular, nonideologi-eal and neutral’ ” and “wholly neutral”); id., at 372 (describing auxiliary services as “religiously neutral”); Roemer, supra, at 751 (opinion of Blaekmun, J.) (describing Tilton’s approved buildings as “neutral or nonideologieal in nature”); 426 U. S., at 754 (describing Meek’s speech and hearing services as “neutral and nonideologieal”); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dish, 509 U. S. 1, 10 (1993) (discussing translator as “neutral service”); Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 232 (1997) (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was “neutral and nonideologieal”); cf. Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 478 (1973) (noting that District Court approved testing cost reimbursement as payment for services that were “ ‘secular, neutral, or nonideologieal’ ” in character, citing Lemon, 403 U. S., at *881 616 ); Wolman, supra, at 242 (quoting Lemon, supra, at 616 (describing permitted services aid as “secular, neutral, or nonideologieal”)).  The shift from equipoise to secular was not, however, our last redefinition, for the Court again transformed the sense of “neutrality” in the 1980’s.  Reexamining and reinterpreting Everson and <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> , we began to use the word “neutral” to mean “evenhanded,” in the sense of allocating aid on some common basis to religious and secular recipients.  Again, neither Everson nor <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> explicitly used “neutral” in this manner, but just as the label for equipoise had lent itself to referring to the secular characteristic of what a government might provide, it was readily adaptable to referring to the generality of government services, as in Everson’s paradigms, to which permissible benefits were compared.  The increased attention to a notion of evenhanded distribution was evident in Nyquist , where the Court distinguished the program under consideration from the government services approved in <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> and Everson , in part because “the class of beneficiaries [in Everson and Allen] included all schoolchildren, those in public as well as those in private schools.” 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38.  Nyquist then reserved the question whether “some form of public assistance .  .  .  made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublie nature of the institution benefitted” would be permissible.  Id., at 783, n. 38 (citations omitted).  Subsequent eases continued the focus on the “generality^ of the approved government services as an important characteristic.  Meek , for example, characterized Everson and <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> as approving “a general program” to pay bus fares and to lend school books, respectively, 421 U. S., at 360 ; id., at 360, n. 8 (approving two similar “general program[s]” in New York and Pennsylvania), and Wolman upheld diagnostic services described as “ ‘general welfare services for children,’” 433 U.S., at 243 (quoting Meek, supra, at 371, n. 21 ).  *882 Justice Blaekmun, writing in Roemer , first called such a “general” or evenhanded program “neutral,” in speaking of “facial neutrality’ as a relevant consideration in determining whether there was an Establishment Clause violation.  “[RJeligious institutions need not be quarantined from public benefits that are neutrally available to all.” 426 U. S., at 746-747 ; see also id., at 746 (discussing buses in Everson and school books in <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> as examples of “neutrally available” aid).  In Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983), the Court adopted the redefinition of neutrality as evenhandedness, citing Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38 , and alluding to our discussion of equal access in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981).  The Court upheld a system of tax deductions for sectarian educational expenses, in part because such a “facially neutral law,” 463 U. S., at 401 , made the deduction available for “all parents, including those whose children attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools,” id., at 397 .  Subsequent cases carried the point forward.  See, e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487 (1986) (quoting Nyquist and characterizing program as making aid “available generally”); Zobrest, swpra, at 8-9 (discussing “government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion” and citing Mueller and Witters); Agos-tini, supra, at 231 (discussing aid allocated on the basis of “neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, .  .  .

S., at 753-757 (approving segregated funds after finding recipients not pervasively religious); Ball, 473 U. S., at 392-393 (noting that “[w]ith but one exception, our subsequent eases have struck down attempts by States to make payments out of *893 public tax dollars directly to primary or secondary religious educational institutions”)?  overruled in part by Agostini, supra, at 236 ; Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 (“It is equally well-settled .  .. that the State may not grant aid to a religious school, whether cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct subsidy to the religious school” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); Rosenberger, supra, at 851-852 (O’CONNOR, J., concurring) (noting that student fee was not a tax).  Divertibility is not, of course, a characteristic of cash alone, and when examining provisions for ostensibly secular supplies we have considered their susceptibility to the service of religious ends.  13 In upholding a scheme to provide students with secular textbooks, we emphasized that “each book loaned must be approved by the public school authorities; only secular books may receive approval.” Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244-245</citedDecision> ; see also Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362 (opinion of Stewart, J.); Wolman, supra, at 237-238 .  By the same token, we could not sustain provisions for instructional materials adaptable to teaching a variety of subjects.  14 Meek, supra, at 363 ; Wolman, supra, at 249-250 .  While the textbooks had a known and fixed secular content not readily di~ *894 vertible to religious teaching purposes, the adaptable materials did not.  15 So, too, we explained the permissibility of busing on public routes to schools but not busing for field trips designed by religious authorities specifically because the latter trips were components of teaching in a pervasively religious school.  Compare Everson, 330 U. S., at 17 (noting wholly separate and secular nature of public bus fare to schools), with Wolmcm, 433 U. S., at 254 (“The field trips are an integral part of the educational experience, and where the teacher works within and for a sectarian institution, an unacceptable risk of fostering of religion is an inevitable byproduct” (citation omitted)).  We likewise were able to uphold underwriting the expenses of standard state testing in religious schools while being forced to strike down aid for testing designed by the school officials, because the latter tests could be used to reinforce religious teaching.

 Divertibility was, again, the issue in an order remanding an as-applied challenge to a grant supporting counseling on teenage sexuality for findings that the aid had not been used to support religious education.  Bowen, 487 U. S., at 621 ; see also id., at 623 (O’Connor, J., concurring).  And the most recent example of attention to the significance of divertibility occurred in our explanation that public school teachers could be assigned to provide limited instruction in religious schools in Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-227 , a majority of the Court rejecting the factual assumption that public school teachers could be readily lured into providing religious instruction.  16 *896 Third, our cases have recognized the distinction, adopted by statute in the Chapter 2 legislation, between aid that merely supplements and aid that supplants expenditures for offerings at religious schools, the latter being barred.  Although we have never adopted the position that any benefit that flows to a religious school is impermissible because it frees up resources for the school to engage in religious indoctrination, Hunt, supra, at 743 , from our first decision holding it permissible to provide textbooks for religious schools we have repeatedly explained the unconstitutionality of aid that supplants an item of the school’s traditional expense.  See, e. g., Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370, 375 (1930) (noting that religious schools “are not the beneficiaries of these appropriations.  They obtain nothing from them, nor are they relieved of a single obligation because of them” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Everson, 330 U. S., at 18 (specifically noting that bus fare program did not support or fund religious schools); Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244</citedDecision> (stating that “the financial benefit [of providing the textbooks] is to parents and children, not to schools” (footnote omitted)); <citedDecision>id., *897at 244, n. 6</citedDecision> (explicitly recognizing that “the record contains no evidence that any of the private schools in appellants’ districts previously provided textbooks for their students”); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 656 (opinion of Brennan, J.) (noting no aid to schools was involved in Allen).  We ignored this prohibition only once, in Regan, 444 U. S., at 646 ; see also ante, at 16, n. 7, where reimbursement for budgeted expenses of required testing was not struck down, but we then quickly returned to the rule as a guideline for permissible aid.  17 In Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12 , the Court specifically distinguished Meek and Ball by explaining that the invalid programs in those eases “relieved sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students.” In Agostini , the Court made a point of noting that the objects of the aid were “by law supplemental to the regular curricula” and, citing Zobrest , explained that the remedial education services did not relieve the religious schools of costs they would otherwise have borne.  521 U. S., at 228 (citing Zobrest, supra, at 12 ).  The Court explicitly stated that the *898 services in question did not “supplant the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already provided in New York City’s sectarian schools.” 521 U. S., at 229 .  Finally, we have recognized what is obvious (however imprecise), in holding “substantial” amounts of aid to be unconstitutional whether or not a plaintiff can show that it supplants a specific item of expense a religious school would have borne.  18 In Meek, 421 U. S., at 366 , we invalidated the loan of instructional materials to religious schools because “faced with the substantial amounts of direct support authorized by [the program], it would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania’s church-related elementary and secondary schools and then characterize [the program] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.” Id., at 365 .

 Meek, 421 U. S., at 363 ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 249-250 .  The same was true of the computers, which were as readily employable for religious teaching as the other equipment, and presumably as immune to any countervailing safeguard, App. 90a, 118a, 164a-165a.  Although library books, like textbooks, have fixed content, religious teachers can assign seeular library books for religious critique, and books for libraries may be religious, as any divinity school library would demonstrate.  The sheer number and variety of boohs that could be and were ordered gave ample opportunity for such diversion.  The divertibility thus inherent in the forms of Chapter 2 aid was enhanced by the structure of the program in Jefferson Parish.  Requests for specific items under Chapter 2 came not from seeular officials, ef.  Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244</citedDecision> - *904 245, but from officials of the religious schools (and even parents of religious school pupils), see ante, at 803 (noting that private religious schools submitted their orders to the government for specific requested items); App. 156a-158a.  The sectarian schools decided what they wanted and often ordered the supplies, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 156a-159a, 171a-172a, to be forwarded directly to themselves, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 156a-159a.  It was easy to select whatever instructional materials and library books the schools wanted, just as it was easy to employ computers for the support of the religious content of the curriculum infused with religious instruction.  The concern with divertibility thus predicated is underscored by the fact that the religious schools in question here covered the primary and secondary grades, the grades in which the sectarian nature of instruction is characteristically the most pervasive, see Lemon, 403 U. S., at 616 ; cf. Tilton, 403 U. S., at 686-689 , and in which pupils are the least critical of the schools’ religious objectives, see Lemon, swpra, at 616.  No one, indeed, disputes the trial judge’s findings, based on a detailed record, that the Roman Catholic schools, 21 which made up the majority of the private schools participating, 22 were pervasively sectarian, 23 that *905 their common objective and mission was to engage in religious education, 24 and that their teachers taught religiously, 25 making them precisely the kind of primary and *906 secondary religious schools that Taise the most serious Establishment Clause concerns.  See Watz, 397 U. S., at 671 ; Hunt, 413 U. S., at 743 ; Lemon, supra, at 636-637 .  The threat to Establishment Clause values wáfe accordingly at its highest in the circumstances of this case. Such precautionary features as there were in the Jefferson Parish scheme were grossly inadequate to counter the threat.  To be sure, the disbursement of the aid was subject to statutory admonitions against diversion, see, e. g., 20 U. S. C. §§7332 , 8897, and was supposedly subject to a variety of safeguards, see ante, at 802-803, 832-834.

 The First Amendment was violated.  But the record here goes beyond risk, to instances of actual diversion.  What one would expect from such paltry efforts at monitoring and enforcement naturally resulted, and the record strongly suggests that other, undocumented diversions probably occurred as well.  First, the record shows actual diversion in the library book, program.  App. 132a-133a.  Although only limited evidence exists, it contrasts starkly with the records of the numerous textbook programs that we have repeatedly upheld, where there was no evidence of any actual diversion.  See Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244-245</citedDecision> ; Meek, supra, at 361-362 ; Wolman, supra, at 237-238 .  Here, discovery revealed that under Chapter 2, nonpublic schools requested and the government purchased at least 191 religious books with taxpayer funds by December 1985.  27 App. 133a.  Books such as A Child’s Book of Prayers, id., at 84a, and The Illustrated Life of Jesus, id., at 132a, *910 were discovered among others that had been ordered under the program.  See also id., at 59a-62a.  The evidence persuasively suggests that other aid was actually diverted as well.  The principal of one religious school testified, for example, that computers lent with Chapter 2 funds were joined in a network with other non-Chapter 2 computers in some schools, and that religious officials and teachers were allowed to develop their own unregulated software for use on this network.
