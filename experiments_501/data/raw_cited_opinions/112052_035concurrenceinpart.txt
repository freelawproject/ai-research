<p id="AZWA">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p id="b873-7">I join Parts I, II-A, and III of Justice Scalia’s opinion in this case. For the reasons given in Part II of Justice White’s opinion, however, I dissent from Part II-B of Justice Scalia’s opinion. In my view, when the correct standard of materiality is applied to the facts of this case, the misrepresentations made by petitioner are properly viewed as material.</p>
