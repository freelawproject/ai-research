**Lead Opinion**
 That the previously undefined power of the courts was *48 substantially curtailed by that Act was early recognized by lower federal courts.  United States v. Holmes, Fed. Cas. No. 15,383, at p. 363; Ex parte Poulson, Fed. Cas. No. 11,350; United States v. New Bedford Bridge, Fed. Cas. No, 15,867, at p. 104; United States v. Seeley, Fed. Cas. No. 16,248a; United States v. Emerson, 4 Cranch (C. C.) 188; Fed. Cas. No. 15,050; Kent’s Commentaries (3rd ,ed. 1836) pp. 300-301.  And when .the Act came before this Court in Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 511 , Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the Court, acknowledgéd that it had limited the power of those courts.  And see.  Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364, 374 .  So far as the decisions of this Court are concerned, that view persisted to the time when Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, was decided.  See Ex parte Wall, 107 U. S. 265 ; Savin, Petitioner, <citedDecision>131 U. S. 267, 276</citedDecision> ; Cuddy, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 280, 285 ; Eilenbecker v. District Court, 134 U. S. 31, 38 .  Mindful of that history, we come to the construction of § 268 of the Judicial Code in light of the specific facts of this case. The question is whether the words “so near thereto” have a geographical or a causal connotation.  Read in their context and in the light of their ordinary meaning, we conclude that they are to be construed as geographical terms.  In Ex parte Robinson, supra, at p. 511 , it was said that as a result of those provisions the power to punish for contempts “can only be exercised to insure order and decorum” in court. “Misbehavior of any person in their presence” plainly falls in that category.  Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289 .  And in Savin, Petitioner, supra, it was also held to include attempted bribes of a witness, one in the jury room and within a few feet of the court room and one in the hallway immediately adjoining the court room.  See Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517 .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The only question before us is whether it has so limited that authority as to preclude summary punishment of the contemptuous action of petitioner which, it is not denied, is “misbehavior” although not in the presence of the court, and which, it is admitted, seriously obstructed the administration of justice in a cause pending in the court. The question is important, for if conduct such as this record discloses may not be dealt with summarily the only recourse of a, federal court for the protection of the integrity of proceed *54 ings pending before it, from acts of corruption and intimidation outside the court room, is to await the indictment of the offenders, with or without adjournment of the pending proceedings as the exigencies of the case may require.  It is not denied that the distance of the present contemptuous action from the court in miles did not lessen its injurious effect, and in that sense it was “near” enough to obstruct the administration of justice.  The opinion of the Court supports its conclusion on the ground that “near” means only geographical nearness and so implicitly holds that no contempt is summarily punishable unless it is either in the presence of the court or is some kind of physical interference with or disturbance of its good order, so that the nearness to the court of the contemptuous act has an effect in obstructing justice which it would not have if it took place at a more distant point.  From all this it seems to follow that the surreptitious tampering with witnesses, jurors or parties in the presence of the court, although unknown to it, would be summarily punishable because in its presence, but that if it took place outside the court room or while the witness, juror or party was on his way to attend court it would not be punishable because geographical nearness is not an element in making the contemptuous action an obstruction to justice.  These contentions assume that “so near thereto” can only refer to geographical position and they ignore the entire history of the judicial interpretation of the statute.  “Near” may connote proximity in causal relationship as well as proximity in space, and under this statute, as the opinion seems to recognize, even the proximity to the court, in space, of the contemptuous action, is of significance only in its causal relationship to the obstructions to justice which result from disorder or public disturbances.  This Court has hitherto, without a dissenting *55 voice, regarded the phrase “so near thereto” as connoting and including those contempts which are the proximate cause of actual obstruction to the administration of justice, whether because of their physical nearness to the court or because of a chain of causation whose operation in producing the obstruction depends on other than geographical relationships to the court. See Savin, Petitioner, <citedDecision>131 U. S. 267</citedDecision> ; Cuddy, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 280 ; Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, 247 U. S. 402 ; Sinclair v. United States, 279 U. S. 749, 764, 765 ; Craig v. Hecht, 263 U. S. 255 .  Cf. McCann v. New York Stock Exchange, 80 F. 2d 211, 213 .  Contempts which obstruct justice because of their effect on the good order and tranquillity of the court must be in the presence of the court or geographically near enough to have that effect.  Contempts which are surreptitious obstructions to justice, through tampering with witnesses, jurors and the like, must be proximately related to the condemned effect.  We are pointed to no legislative history which militates against such a construction of the statute.  In the Savin, the Craig , and the Sinclair cases, as well as in the Toledo case, the contempts were of this latter kind.  The contempt held summarily punishable by this Court in the Savin case, decided sixty years ago, was the attempted bribery of a witness at a place in the court house but outside the courtroom, without any disorder or disturbance of the court. The contemptuous acts in the other cases took place at points distant from the court in the city where it sat. In all, the injurious effect on the administration of justice was unrelated to the distance from the court. In holding that they were con-tempts within the summary jurisdiction of the court this Court definitely decided that “so near thereto” is not confined to a spatial application where the evil effect of the alleged contempt does not depend upon its physical nearness to the court. *56 The Savin and Sinclair cases were decided by a unanimous court. The dissenting judges in the Toledo and Craig cases, in which the acts held to be contemptuous were the publication, at a distance from the court, of comments derogatory to the judge, made no contention that the phrase imposed a geographical limitation on the power of the court. Their position was that the particular contemptuous acts charged did not in fact have the effect of obstructing justice, a contention which cannot be urged here.  In the Toledo case, Justice Holmes said, page 423: “I think that ‘so.  near as to obstruct’ means so near as actually to obstruct — and not merely near enough to threaten a possible obstruction.” And in the Craig case, after commenting on the fact that no cause was pending before the court, he said, p. 281: “Suppose the petitioner falsely and unjustly charged the judge with having excluded him from knowledge of the facts, how can it be pretended that the charge obstructed the administration of justice.  .  .  .” Complete agreement with the dissents, in these- cases neither requires the- Court’s decision here nor lends it any support.  I do not understand my brethren to maintain that the secret bribery or intimidation of a witness in the court room may not be summarily punished.  Cf. <citedDecision>Savin, supra;</citedDecision> Sinclair, supra. If so, it is only because of the effect of the contemptuous act in obstructing justice, which is precisely the same if the bribery or intimidation took place outside the court house.  If it may be so punished I can hardly believe that Congress, by use of the phrase “so near thereto,” intended to lay down a different rule if the contemptuous acts took place across the corridor, the street, in another block, or -a mile away.  If the point were more doubtful than it seems to me, I should still think that we should leave undisturbed a construction of the ¡statute so long applied and not hitherto doubted in this Court. We recently declined to *57 consider the contention that the Sherman Act can never apply to a labor union, because of long standing decisions of this Court to the contrary, a construction which Congress had not seen fit to change.  See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U. S. 469, 487, 488 .  In view of our earlier decisions and of the serious consequences to the.  administration of justice if courts are powerless to stop, summarily, obstructions like the present, I think the responsibility of departing from the long accepted construction of this statute should be left to the legislative branch of the Government, to which it rightfully belongs.

**Combined Opinion**
 The two sections of the Act of March 2, 1831 when read together, as they must be clearly indicate that the category of criminal cases which could be tried without a jury was narrowly confined.  That the previously undefined power of the courts was *48 substantially curtailed by that Act was early recognized by lower federal courts.  United States v. Holmes, Fed. Cas. No. 15,383, at p. 363; Ex parte Poulson, Fed. Cas. No. 11,350; United States v. New Bedford Bridge, Fed. Cas. No. 15,867, at p. 104; United States v. Seeley, Fed. Cas. No. 16,248a; United States v.
