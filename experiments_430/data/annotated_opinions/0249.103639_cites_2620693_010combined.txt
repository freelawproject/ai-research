**Combined Opinion**
 To the extent of any property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent (a) by will .  .  • An order of the New York Surrogate’s Court, 172 Misc. 426 , 15 N. Y. S. 2d 208, reduced the estate tax assessed against the decedent’s estate by excluding from his gross estate the share of the trust fund passing to the widow by the exercise of the power, on the ground that the state was without constitutional authority to tax the exercise by a resident donee of a power of appointment created by a *660 nonresident donor, citing Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton, 272 U. S. 567 .  The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the order without opinion, 286 N. Y. 596 , 35 N. E. 2d 937 , but certified by its remittitur that it held that the taxing statute, as sought to be applied in this proceeding, violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  We granted certiorari, 314 U. S. 601 , because of the importance of the question presented.  For purposes of estate and inheritance taxation, the power to dispose of property at death is the equivalent of ownership.  Bullen v. Wisconsin, <citedDecision>240 U. S. 625</citedDecision> ; Whitney v. Tax Comm’n, 309 U. S. 530, 538 ; see Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities, 3d ed. 1916, § 524.  It is a potential source of wealth to the appointee.  The disposition of wealth effected by its exercise or relinquishment at death is one form of the enjoyment of wealth and is an appropriate subject of taxation.  The power to tax “is an incident of sovereignty, and is coextensive with that to which it is an incident.  All subjects over which the sovereign power of a State extends are objects of taxation.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429 .  Intangibles, which are legal relationships between persons and which in fact have no geographical location, are so associated with the owner that they and their transfer at death are taxable at the place of his domicile, where his person and the exercise of his property rights are subject to the control of the sovereign power.  His transfer of interests in intangibles, by virtue of the exercise of a donated power instead of that derived from ownership, stands on the same footing.  In both cases the sovereign’s control over his person and estate at the place of his domicile, and his duty to contribute to the financial support of government there, afford adequate constitutional basis for the imposition of a tax. Curry v. McCanless, 307 U. S. 357 ; cf. Graves v. Elliott, 307 U. S. 383 .  *661 These were not novel propositions, when they were restated in the McCanless and Elliott cases, 1 and they were challenged then, though unsuccessfully, only on the ground that the transfer of the intangibles was subject to taxation in another state where they were held in trust.  But the contention that the due process clause forecloses taxation of an interest in intangibles by the state of its owner when they are held in trust in another state was rejected in Bullen v. Wisconsin, <citedDecision>240 U. S. 625</citedDecision> .  In that case, a fund had been given in trust reserving to the donor a general power of revocation and the disposition of the trust income during life. This Court held that upon his death an inheritance tax could be levied by the state of his domicile although the trustee and the trust fund were outside the state.  In numerous other cases the jurisdiction to tax the use and enjoyment of interests in intangibles, regardless of the location of the paper evidences of them, has been thought to depend on no factor other than the domicile of the owner within the taxing state.  And it has been held that they may be constitutionally taxed there even though in some instances they may be subject to taxation in other jurisdictions, to whose control they are subject and whose legal protection they enjoy.  2 And such interests taxable *662 at the domicile of the owner have been deemed to include the exercise or relinquishment of a power to dispose of intangibles.  Chan ler v. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466 ; <citedDecision>Bullen</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wisconsin, supra;</citedDecision> cf. Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278 ; Salton stall v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260 .  Decedent’s complete and exclusive power to dispose of the intangibles at death was property in his hands in New York, where he was domiciled.  Graves v. Elliott, supra. He there made effective use of the power to bestow his bounty on the widow.  Its exercise by his will to make a gift was as much an enjoyment of a property right as would have been a like bequest to his widow from his own securities.  See Helvering v. Horst, 311 U. S. 112, 117 .  Eor such enjoyment of property rights, through resort to New York law, decedent was under the highest obligation to contribute to the support of the government whose protection he enjoyed in common with other residents.  Taxation of such enjoyment of the power to dispose of property is as much within the constitutional power of the state of his domicile as is the taxation of the transfer at death of intangibles which he owns.

 A transfer in one state of a chose in action or a share of stock may be taxed there even though the transferee in order to enjoy its benefits must depend in part upon the law of the state of the debtor or of the corporation.  Blodgett v. Silberman, 277 U. S. 1, 10-17 .  Here the relationship of the power to Massachusetts does not leave New York without sufficient control over the donee and his exercise of the power to support its constitutional authority to tax. For the fact remains that he, as a resident enjoying the protection of New York's laws and owing to it the duty of financial support, has disposed of wealth by a will executed and probated in New York with the same result as if he had owned the property.  This transmission of wealth at death by a resident is not a forbidden source of revenue to the state.  Wachovia Trust Co. v. Doughton, supra, on which respondents rely, denied the constitutional power of a state to tax the effective exercise of a testamentary power in circumstances like the present.  The only grounds for the decision were that the intangibles held in trust in another state, which were the subject of the power, had no situs in the state where the domiciled testator had exercised the power by his will; that its exercise was subject to the laws *665 of Massachusetts where the will donating the power and establishing the trust had been probated, and that no “right” exercised by the donee was conferred by the state of his domicile where it was exercised.  The conclusion there reached and the reasons advanced in its support cannot be reconciled with the decision and the reasoning of the <citedDecision>Bullen</citedDecision> , the McCanless and the Elliott cases. It is plain that if appropriate emphasis be placed on-the orderly administration of justice rather than blind adherence to conflicting precedents, the Wachovia case must be overruled.  There is no reason why the state should continue to be deprived of revenue from a subject which from the beginning has been within the reach of its taxing power; a subject over which we cannot say the state’s control has been curtailed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  No interest which could be served by so rigid an adherence to stare decisis is superior to the demands of a system of justice based on a considered and a consistent application of the Constitution.  See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 , footnote 1; and cf. Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376, 387 .  The Wachovia case should be and now is overruled and the constitutional power of New York to levy the present tax is sustained.  Reversed.  Me. Justice Robeets concurs in the result only because he considers himself bound by the decisions in Curry v. McCanless, 307 U. S. 357 , and Graves v. Elliott, 307 U. S. 383 .  Otherwise he would vote to affirm.  1 See Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278 ; Chanler v. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466 ; Bullen v. Wisconsin, <citedDecision>240 U. S. 625</citedDecision> ; Saltonstall v.
