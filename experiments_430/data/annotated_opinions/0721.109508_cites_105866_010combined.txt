 We must spell out from conflicting indications of congressional will the area in which state action is still permissible." Garner v. Teamsters Union, 346 U. S. 485, 488 (1953).  Federal labor policy as reflected in the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, has been construed not to preclude the States from regulating aspects of labor relations that involve "conduct touch[ing] interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that .  .  .  we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act." San Diego Unions v. Garmon, <citedDecision>359 U. S. 236, 244</citedDecision> (1959).  Policing of actual or threatened violence to persons or destruction of property has been held most clearly a matter for the States.  [2] *137 Similarly, the federal law governing labor relations does not withdraw "from the States .  .  .  power to regulate where the activity regulated [is] a merely peripheral concern of the Labor Management Relations Act." <citedDecision>Id., at 243</citedDecision> .  [3] *138 Cases that have held state authority to be pre-empted by federal law tend to fall into one of two categories: (1) those that reflect the concern that "one forum would enjoin, as illegal, conduct which the other forum would find legal" and (2) those that reflect the concern "that the [application of state law by] state courts would restrict the exercise of rights guaranteed by the Federal Acts." Automobile Workers v. Russell, 356 U. S. 634, 644 (1958).  "[I]n referring to decisions holding state laws pre-empted by the NLRA, care must be taken to distinguish pre-emption based on federal protection of the conduct in question .  .  .  from that based predominantly on the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board .  .  .  , although the two are often not easily separable." Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S. 369 , 383 n. 19 (1969).  Each of these distinct aspects of labor law pre-emption has had its own history in our decisions, to which we now turn.  We consider first pre-emption based predominantly on the primary jurisdiction of the Board.  This line of pre-emption analysis was developed in <citedDecision>San Diego Unions</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Garmon, supra</citedDecision> , and its history was recently summarized in Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 290-291 (1971): "[V]arying approaches were taken by the Court in initially grappling with this pre-emption problem.  Thus, for example, some early cases suggested the true distinction lay between judicial application of general common law, which was permissible, as opposed to state rules specifically designed to regulate *139 labor relations, which were pre-empted.  See, e. g., Automobile Workers v. Russell, 356 U. S. 634, 645 (1958).  Others made pre-emption turn on whether the States purported to apply a remedy not provided for by the federal scheme, e. g., Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 348 U. S. 468, 479-480 (1955), while in still others the Court undertook a thorough scrutiny of the federal Act to ascertain whether the state courts had, in fact, arrived at conclusions inconsistent with its provisions, e. g., Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd., 336 U. S. 245 (1949).  .  .  .  [N]one of these approaches proved satisfactory, however, and each was ultimately abandoned.  It was, in short, experience not pure logicwhich initially taught that each of these methods sacrificed important federal interests in a uniform law of labor relations centrally administered by an expert agency without yielding anything in return by way of predictability or ease of judicial application.  "The failure of alternative analyses and the interplay of the foregoing policy considerations, then, led this Court to hold in Garmon, <citedDecision>359 U. S., at 244</citedDecision> : " `When it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under § 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield.  To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law.' " See also <citedDecision>San Diego Unions</citedDecision> v. Garmon, <citedDecision>359 U. S., at 244-247</citedDecision> ; Lockridge, supra, at 286-290 .  *140 However, a second line of pre-emption analysis has been developed in cases focusing upon the crucial inquiry whether Congress intended that the conduct involved be unregulated because left "to be controlled by the free play of economic forces." NLRB v. Nash-Finch Co., 404 U. S. 138, 144 (1971).  [4] Concededly this inquiry was not made in 1949 in the so-called Briggs-Stratton case, Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 336 U. S. 245 (1949), the decision of this Court heavily relied upon by the court below in reaching its decision that state regulation of the conduct at issue is not pre-empted by national labor law. In Briggs-Stratton, the union, in order to bring pressure on the employer during negotiations, *141 adopted a plan whereby union meetings were called at irregular times during working hours without advance notice to the employer or any notice as to whether or when the workers would return.  In a proceeding under the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act, the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board issued an order forbidding the union and its members to engage in concerted efforts to interfere with production by those methods.  This Court did not inquire whether Congress meant that such methods should be reserved to the union "to be controlled by the free play of economic forces." Rather, because these methods were "neither made a right under federal law nor a violation of it" the Court held that there "was no basis for denying to Wisconsin the power, in governing her internal affairs, to regulate" such conduct.
**Combined Opinion**
 The Court had earlier recognized in pre-emption cases that Congress meant to leave some activities unregulated and to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.  Garner v. Teamsters Union , in finding pre-empted state power to restrict peaceful recognitional picketing, said: "The detailed prescription of a procedure for restraint of specified types of picketing would seem to imply that other picketing is to be free of other methods and sources of restraint.  For the policy of the national Labor Management Relations Act is not to condemn all picketing but only that ascertained by its prescribed processes to fall within its prohibitions.  Otherwise, it is implicit in the Act that the public interest is served by freedom of labor to use the weapon of picketing.  For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act prohibits." 346 U. S., at 499-500 .  [5] Moreover, <citedDecision>San Diego Unions</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Garmon</citedDecision> expressly recognized that "the Board may decide that an activity is neither protected nor prohibited, and thereby raise the *145 question whether such activity may be regulated by the States." <citedDecision>359 U. S., at 245</citedDecision> .  [6] It is true, however, that many decisions fleshing out the concept of activities "protected" because Congress meant them to be "unrestricted by any governmental power to regulate," Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 488 , involved review of per se NLRB rules applied in the regulation of the bargaining process.  E. g., NLRB v. American National Ins. Co., 343 U. S. 395 (1952); NLRB v. Insurance Agents, supra ; NLRB v. Drivers Local Union, 362 U. S. 274 (1960); NLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S. 278 (1965); American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300 (1965); cf. NLRB v. Truck Drivers Union, 353 U. S. 87 (1957); H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S. 99 (1970); Florida Power & Light v. Electrical Workers, 417 U. S. 790 , 805 n. 16 (1974).  But the analysis of Garner and Insurance Agents came full bloom in the pre-emption area in Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 (1964), which held pre-empted the application *146 of state law to award damages for peaceful union secondary picketing.  Although Morton involved conduct neither "protected nor prohibited" by § 7 or § 8 of the NLRA, we recognized the necessity of an inquiry whether " `Congress occupied this field and closed it to state regulation.' " 377 U. S., at 258 .  Central to Morton 's analysis was the observation that "[i]n selecting which forms of economic pressure should be prohibited .

 .  .  left for the free play of contending economic forces, .  .  .  is not merely [to fill] a gap [by] outlaw[ing] what federal law fails to outlaw; it is denying one party to an economic contest a weapon that Congress meant him to have available." Lesnick, Preemption Reconsidered: The Apparent Reaffirmation of <citedDecision>Garmon</citedDecision> , 72 Col. L. Rev. 469, 478 (1972).  [12] Accordingly, such regulation by *151 the State is impermissible because it " `stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' " Hill v. Florida, 325 U. S. 538 , 542 (1945).  IV There remains the question of the continuing vitality of Briggs-Stratton.  San Diego Unions v. Garmon, <citedDecision>359 U. S., at 245</citedDecision> n. 4, made clear that the Briggs-Stratton approach to pre-emption is "no longer of general application." See also Insurance Agents, supra, at 493 n. 23.  We hold today that the ruling of Briggs-Stratton, permitting state regulation of partial strike activities such as are involved in this case is likewise "no longer of general application." [13] *152 Briggs-Stratton assumed "management .  .  .  would be disabled from any kind of self-help to cope with these coercive tactics of the union" and could not "take any steps to resist or combat them without incurring the sanctions of the Act."
**Combined Opinion**
 This is equally true whether the self-help activities *156 are those of the employer or the Union.  I agree with the Court that the Wisconsin law, as applied in this case, is pre-empted since it directly curtails the self-help capability of the Union and its members, resulting in a significant shift in the balance of free economic bargaining power struck by Congress.  I write to make clear my understanding that the Court's opinion does not, however, preclude the States from enforcing, in the context of a labor dispute, "neutral" state statutes or rules of decision: state laws that are not directed toward altering the bargaining positions of employers or unions but which may have an incidental effect on relative bargaining strength.  Except where Congress has specifically provided otherwise, the States generally should remain free to enforce, for example, their law of torts or of contracts, and other laws reflecting neutral public policy.  [*] See Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1337 , 1355-1356 (1972).  With this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court. MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, dissenting.  If the partial strike activity in this case were protected, or even arguably protected, by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, the Court's conclusion would be supported by San Diego Unions v. Garmon, <citedDecision>359 U. S. 236</citedDecision> .  But in Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 336 U. S. 245 ( Briggs-Stratton ), the Court rejected the argument that comparable activity was protected by § 7.  And as I understand the Court's holding today, it assumes *157 that this activity remains unprotected.  [1] Moreover, if such activity were prohibited, or arguably prohibited, by § 8 of the Act, the Court's conclusion would also be supported by <citedDecision>Garmon</citedDecision> .  But ever since NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , it has been clear that this activity is not even arguably prohibited.  If Congress had focused on the problems presented by partial strike activity, and had enacted special legislation dealing with this subject matter, but left the form of the activity disclosed by this record unregulated, the Court's conclusion would be supported by Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 .  But this is not such a case. Despite the numerous statements in the Court's opinion about Congress' intent to leave partial strike activity wholly unregulated, I have found no legislative expression of any such intent nor any evidence that Congress has scrutinized such activity.  [2] *158 If this Court had previously held that the no-man's land in which conduct is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited by federal law is nevertheless pre-empted by an unexpressed legislative intent, I would follow such a holding.  But none of the cases reviewed in the Court's opinion so holds.  [3] Ever since 1949, when Briggs-Stratton was decided, the rule has been that partial strike activity within that area may be regulated by the States.
**Combined Opinion**
Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 336 U. S. 245, 253 (1949).  [3]  Thus Machinists v. Gonzales, 356 U. S. 617 (1958), held that a state court was not precluded from ordering the reinstatement by a union of a wrongfully expelled member and awarding him damages, even though the union's conduct might also involve an unfair labor practice, since there was only a remote possibility of conflict with enforcement by the National Labor Relations Board of national policy.  And in Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181 (1965), we resolved the "troublesome question of where lies the line between permissible and federally preempted state regulation of [the] union activities" there presented, id., at 183 , by concluding that the Act's amendment expressly to exclude supervisory employees from the critical definition of "employees" eliminated any serious problems of pre-emption since "many provisions of the Act employing that pivotal term would cease to operate where supervisors were the focus of concern." Id., at 188 .  Further, in Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53 (1966), we held that the availability of a state judicial remedy for malicious libel would not impinge upon the national labor policy.  [4]  See Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1337 , 1352 (1972): "An appreciation of the true character of the national labor policy expressed in the NLRA and the LMRA indicates that in providing a legal framework for union organization, collective bargaining, and the conduct of labor disputes, Congress struck a balance of protection, prohibition, and laissez-faire in respect to union organization, collective bargaining, and labor disputes that would be upset if a state could also enforce statutes or rules of decision resting upon its views concerning accommodation of the same interests." Cf. Lesnick, Preemption Reconsidered: The Apparent Reaffirmation of <citedDecision>Garmon</citedDecision> , 72 Col. L. Rev. 469, 478, 480 (1972): "[T]he failure of Congress to prohibit certain conduct warrant[s a] negative inference that it was deemed proper, indeed desirable at least, desirable to be left for the free play of contending economic forces.  Thus, the state is not merely filling a gap when it outlaws what federal law fails to outlaw; it is denying one party to an economic contest a weapon that Congress meant him to have available.  ..... "The premise is .  .  .  that Congress judged whether the conduct was illicit or legitimate, and that `legitimate' connotes, not simply that federal law is neutral, but that the conduct is to be assimilated to the large residual area in which a regime of free collective bargaining economic warfare,' if you preferis thought to be the course of regulatory wisdom." [5]  It is true, of course, that the seeds of the <citedDecision>Garmon</citedDecision> "primary jurisdiction of the NLRB" approach to labor law pre-emption are also contained within the Garner opinion.  See, in addition to the textual quotation, Garner, 346 U. S., at 490-491 .  [6]  Although Mr. Justice Harlan took issue with the statement in <citedDecision>Garmon</citedDecision> that States may "be powerless to act when the underlying activities are clearly `neither protected nor prohibited' by the federal Act," <citedDecision>359 U. S., at 253</citedDecision> (concurring in result), his later opinions make plain that the point of disagreement concerned the use of the term "protected" rather than the substantive concept.  "In the context of labor relations law, this word is fraught with ambiguity.  `Protected conduct' may, for example, refer to employee conduct which the States may not prohibit, .  .  .  or to conduct against which the employer may not retaliate." Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S. 369 , 382 n. 17 (1969).  Indeed, Mr. Justice Harlan thereafter expressly adopted the <citedDecision>Garmon</citedDecision> formulation.  Hanna Mining v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S., at 187 .  It has been suggested that rather than "protected," `[p]ermitted activities' would be better shorthand for this category of employee conduct because it may beindeed isprotected against state, but not employer interference." Cox, supra, n. 4, at 1346 (footnote omitted).  [7]  "[T]he Taft-Hartley Act was, to a marked degree, the result of conflict and compromise between strong contending forces and deeply held views on the .  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 The Union argues that Congress focused upon partial strike activity during passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136 , relying upon a provision passed by the House, but rejected in the Conference Committee, that declared unlawful "any sit-down strike or other concerted interference with an employer's operations conducted by remaining on the employer's premises." H. R. 3020, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., § 12 (a) (3) (A) (1947).  See H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 27-28, 43-44 (1947); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38-39, 42-43, 58-59 (1947).  The concerted refusal to work overtime in this case does not involve "concerted interference with an employer's operations conducted by remaining on the employer's premises." [3]  In NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , the Court held that the partial strike activity in that case did not violate the union's duty to bargain in good faith; in other words, even though the activity was not protected by § 7, it was not prohibited by § 8.  Contrary to the Court's implication, ante, at 141, the case did not hold that the States could not prohibit such activity, but only that the NLRB had not been authorized to do so. Congress' failure to grant power over such activity to the NLRB hardly amounts to withdrawal of the same power from the States.  The Court's quotation, ibid., from Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181, 187 , when read in context, is nothing more than a reference to a statement in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, <citedDecision>359 U. S. 236</citedDecision> , which poses, but does not answer, the question whether pre-emption extends to activity that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.  [4]  See n. 2, supra. [5]  I cannot agree with the Court's conclusion that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, overruled today, numbers among those that have been eroded rather than preserved.  See ante, at 151-154, and n. 12.  The decision in Insurance Agents, supra, is readily distinguishable.  See n. 3, supra. It is true that Briggs-Stratton has been limited to its facts insofar as it sanctions judicial determination whether conduct arguably protected by § 7 or prohibited by § 8 is actually protected or prohibited.  Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 291 ; <citedDecision>San Diego Unions</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Garmon, supra,</citedDecision> at 245 n. 4; see Insurance Agents, supra, at 492-494 , and nn. 22, 23.  But the rule established in <citedDecision>Garmon</citedDecision> , and reaffirmed in Lockridge , is fully consistent with the conclusion that the States may regulate conduct that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.
