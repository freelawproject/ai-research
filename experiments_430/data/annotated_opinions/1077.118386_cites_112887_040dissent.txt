 The Court began to employ “neutrality” in a sense different from equipoise, however, as it explicated the distinction between “religious” and “secular” benefits to religious schools, the latter being in some circumstances permissible.  See infra, at 884-899 (discussing considerations).  Even though both Everson and Allen had anticipated some such distinction, neither ease had used the term “neutral” in this way.  In Everson , Justice Black indicated that providing *880 police, fire, and similar government services to religious institutions was permissible, in part because they were “so separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function.” 330 U. S., at 18 .  Allen similarly focused on the fact that the textbooks lent out were “secular” and approved by secular authorities, 392 U. S., at 245 , and assumed that the secular textbooks and the secular elements of education they supported were not so intertwined with religious instruction as “in fact [to be] instrumental in the teaching of religion,” id., at 248 .  Such was the Court’s premise in Lemon for shifting the use of the word “neutral” from labeling the required position of the government to describing a benefit that was nonreligious.  We spoke of “[o]ur decisions from Everson to Allen [as] permitting] the States to provide church-related schools with secular, neutral, or nonideological services, facilities, or materials,” 403 U. S., at 616, and thereafter, we regularly used “neutral” in this second sense of “secular” or “nonreligious.” See, e. g., Tilton, supra, at 687-688 (characterizing subsidized teachers in Lemon as “not necessarily religiously neutral,” but buildings as “religiously neutral”); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 365-366 (1975) (describing instructional materials as “ ‘secular, nonideologi-eal and neutral’ ” and “wholly neutral”); id., at 372 (describing auxiliary services as “religiously neutral”); Roemer, supra, at 751 (opinion of Blaekmun, J.) (describing Tilton’s approved buildings as “neutral or nonideologieal in nature”); 426 U. S., at 754 (describing Meek’s speech and hearing services as “neutral and nonideologieal”); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dish, <citedDecision>509 U. S. 1, 10</citedDecision> (1993) (discussing translator as “neutral service”); Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 232 (1997) (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was “neutral and nonideologieal”); cf. Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 478 (1973) (noting that District Court approved testing cost reimbursement as payment for services that were “ ‘secular, neutral, or nonideologieal’ ” in character, citing Lemon, 403 U. S., at *881 616 ); Wolman, supra, at 242 (quoting Lemon, supra, at 616 (describing permitted services aid as “secular, neutral, or nonideologieal”)).  The shift from equipoise to secular was not, however, our last redefinition, for the Court again transformed the sense of “neutrality” in the 1980’s.  Reexamining and reinterpreting Everson and Allen , we began to use the word “neutral” to mean “evenhanded,” in the sense of allocating aid on some common basis to religious and secular recipients.  Again, neither Everson nor Allen explicitly used “neutral” in this manner, but just as the label for equipoise had lent itself to referring to the secular characteristic of what a government might provide, it was readily adaptable to referring to the generality of government services, as in Everson’s paradigms, to which permissible benefits were compared.  The increased attention to a notion of evenhanded distribution was evident in Nyquist , where the Court distinguished the program under consideration from the government services approved in Allen and Everson , in part because “the class of beneficiaries [in Everson and Allen] included all schoolchildren, those in public as well as those in private schools.” 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38.  Nyquist then reserved the question whether “some form of public assistance .  .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 First, we have recognized the fact that the overriding religious mission of certain schools, those sometimes called *886 “pervasively sectarian,” is not confined to a discrete element of the curriculum, Everson, 330 U. S., at 22-24 (Jackson, J., dissenting); id., at 45-47 (Rutledge, J., dissenting), but permeates their teaching.  6 Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 671 (1970); Lemon, supra, at 636-637 (“A school which operates to commingle religion with other instruction plainly cannot completely secularize its instruction.  Parochial schools, in large measure, do not accept the assumption that secular subjects should be unrelated to religious teaching”); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 621-622 (1988) (discussing pervasively sectarian private schools).  Based on record evidence and long experience, we have concluded that religious teaching in such schools is at the core of the instructors’ individual and personal obligations, cf. Canon 803, §2, Text & Commentary 568 (“It is necessary that the formation and education given in a Catholic school be based upon the principles of Catholic doctrine; teachers are to be outstanding for their correct doctrine and integrity of life”), and that individual religious teachers will teach religiously.  7 Lemon, 403 U. S., at 615-620 ; id., at 635- *887 641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 ; Meek, 421 U. S., at 369-371 ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 249-250 (discussing nonseverability of religious and secular education); Ball, 473 U. S., at 399-400 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by Agostini, 521 U. S., at 236 .  As religious teaching cannot be separated from secular education in such schools or by such teachers, we have concluded that direct government subsidies to such schools are prohibited because they will inevitably and impermissibly support religious indoctrination.  Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 12</citedDecision> (discussing Meek and Ball).  Second, we have expressed special concern about aid to primary and secondary religious schools.  Tilton, 403 U. S., at 685-686 .  On the one hand, we have understood how the youth of the students in such schools makes them highly susceptible to religious indoctrination.  Lemon, supra, at 616 (“This process of inculcating religious doctrine is, of course, enhanced by the impressionable age of the pupils, in primary schools particularly”).  On the other, we have recognized that the religious element in the education offered in most sectarian primary and secondary schools is far more intertwined with the secular than in university teaching, where the natural and academic skepticism of most older students may separate the two, see Tilton, supra, at 686-689 ; Roermer, 426 U. S., at 750 .  Thus, government benefits accruing to these pervasively religious primary and secondary schools raise special dangers of diversion into support for the religious indoctrination of children and the involvement of government in religious training and practice.  *888 2 We have also evaluated the portent of support to an organization’s religious mission that may be inherent in the method by which aid is granted, finding pertinence in at least two characteristics of distribution.  First, we have asked whether aid is direct or indirect, observing distinctions between government schemes with individual beneficiaries and those whose beneficiaries in the first instance might be religious schools.  Everson, supra, at 18 (bus fare supports parents and not schools); Allen, 392 U. S., 243 -244, and n. 6 (textbooks go to benefit children and parents, not schools); Lemon, supra, at 621 (invalidating direct aid to schools); Levitt, supra, at 480, 482 (invalidating direct testing aid to schools); Witters, 474 U. S., at 487-488 (evaluating whether aid was a direct subsidy to schools).  Direct aid obviously raises greater risks, although recent eases have discounted this risk factor, looking to other features of the distribution mechanism.  Agostini, supra, at 225-226 .  8 *889 Second, we have distinguished between indirect aid that reaches religious schools only incidentally as a result of numerous individual choices and aid that is in reality directed to religious schools by the government or in practical terms selected by religious schools themselves.  Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 ; Witters, supra, at 488 ; <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 10</citedDecision> .  In these cases, we have declared the constitutionality of programs providing aid directly to parents or students as tax deductions or scholarship money, where such aid may pay for education at some sectarian institutions, Mueller, supra, at 399 ; Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , but only as the result of “genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients,” id., at 487 .  We distinguished this path of aid from the route in Ball and Wolman , where the opinions indicated that “[wjhere ... no meaningful distinction can be made between aid to the student and aid to the school, the concept of a loan to individuals is a transparent fiction.” 474 U. S., at 487, n. 4 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  9 3 In addition to the character of the school to which the benefit accrues, and its path from government to school, a number of features of the aid itself have figured in the elassifica- *890 tions we have made.  First, we have barred aid with actual religious content, which would obviously run afoul of the ban on the government’s participation in religion, Everson, 330 U. S., at 16 ; Walz, 397 U. S., at 668 ; cf. Lemon, 403 U. S., at 617 (discussing variable ideological and religious character of religious teachers compared to fixed content of books).  In eases where we have permitted aid, we have regularly characterized it as “neutral” in the sense (noted supra, at 879-881) of being without religious content.  See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 688 (characterizing buildings as “religiously neutral”); Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> (describing translator as “neutral service”); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 232 (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was “neutral and nonideological”).  See also ante, at 820 (plurality opinion) (barring aid with religious content).  10 Second, we have long held government aid invalid when circumstances would allow its diversion to religious education.  The risk of diversion is obviously high when aid in the form of government funds makes its way into the coffers of religious organizations, and so from the start we have understood the Constitution to bar outright money grants of aid to religion.  11 See Everson, 830 U. S., at 16 (“[The State] *891 cannot consistently with the ‘establishment of religion’ clause of the First Amendment contribute tax-raised funds to the support of an institution which teaches the tenets and faith of any church”); id., at 18 (“The State contributes no money to the schools.  It does not support them”); Allen, 892 U. S., at 243-244 (“[N]o funds or books are furnished to parochial schools, and the financial benefit is to parents and children, not schools”); Walz, supra, at 675 (“Obviously a direct money subsidy would be a relationship pregnant with involvement and, as with most governmental grant programs, could encompass sustained and detailed administrative relationships for enforcement of statutory or administrative standards”); Lemon, supra, at 612 (identifying “three main evils” against which Establishment Clause was to protect as “sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity,” citing Walz); 403 U. S., at 621 (distinguishing direct financial aid program from Everson and Allen and noting problems with required future surveillance); Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 762, 774 (striking down “direct money grants” for maintaining buildings because there was no attempt to restrict payments to those expenditures related exclusively to secular purposes); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480, 482 (striking down “direct money grant” for testing expenses); 12 Hunt v. *892 McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 745, n. 7 (1973) (noting approved aid is “no expenditure of public funds, either by grant or loan”); Wolman, 433 U. S., at 239 , and n. 7 (noting that “statute does not authorize any payment to nonpublic school personnel for the costs of administering the tests”); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228-229 (emphasizing that approved services are not “distributed ‘directly to the religious schools.’ ... No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a school-wide basis” (citations omitted)); Bowen, 487 U. S., at 614-615 ; Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 (noting that “we have recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions”); ef.  Lemon, 403 U. S., at 619-620 (noting that safeguards and accounting inspections required to prevent government funds from supporting religious education will cause impermissible entanglement); Roemer, 426 U. S., at 753-757 (approving segregated funds after finding recipients not pervasively religious); Ball, 473 U. S., at 392-393 (noting that “[w]ith but one exception, our subsequent eases have struck down attempts by States to make payments out of *893 public tax dollars directly to primary or secondary religious educational institutions”)?
**Dissenting Opinion**
 And the most recent example of attention to the significance of divertibility occurred in our explanation that public school teachers could be assigned to provide limited instruction in religious schools in Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-227 , a majority of the Court rejecting the factual assumption that public school teachers could be readily lured into providing religious instruction.  16 *896 Third, our cases have recognized the distinction, adopted by statute in the Chapter 2 legislation, between aid that merely supplements and aid that supplants expenditures for offerings at religious schools, the latter being barred.  Although we have never adopted the position that any benefit that flows to a religious school is impermissible because it frees up resources for the school to engage in religious indoctrination, Hunt, supra, at 743 , from our first decision holding it permissible to provide textbooks for religious schools we have repeatedly explained the unconstitutionality of aid that supplants an item of the school’s traditional expense.  See, e. g., Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370, 375 (1930) (noting that religious schools “are not the beneficiaries of these appropriations.  They obtain nothing from them, nor are they relieved of a single obligation because of them” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Everson, 330 U. S., at 18 (specifically noting that bus fare program did not support or fund religious schools); Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 (stating that “the financial benefit [of providing the textbooks] is to parents and children, not to schools” (footnote omitted)); id., *897 at 244, n. 6 (explicitly recognizing that “the record contains no evidence that any of the private schools in appellants’ districts previously provided textbooks for their students”); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 656 (opinion of Brennan, J.) (noting no aid to schools was involved in Allen).  We ignored this prohibition only once, in Regan, 444 U. S., at 646 ; see also ante, at 16, n. 7, where reimbursement for budgeted expenses of required testing was not struck down, but we then quickly returned to the rule as a guideline for permissible aid.  17 In Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 12</citedDecision> , the Court specifically distinguished Meek and Ball by explaining that the invalid programs in those eases “relieved sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students.” In Agostini , the Court made a point of noting that the objects of the aid were “by law supplemental to the regular curricula” and, citing <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , explained that the remedial education services did not relieve the religious schools of costs they would otherwise have borne.  521 U. S., at 228 (citing <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 12</citedDecision> ).  The Court explicitly stated that the *898 services in question did not “supplant the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already provided in New York City’s sectarian schools.” 521 U. S., at 229 .  Finally, we have recognized what is obvious (however imprecise), in holding “substantial” amounts of aid to be unconstitutional whether or not a plaintiff can show that it supplants a specific item of expense a religious school would have borne.  18 In Meek, 421 U. S., at 366 , we invalidated the loan of instructional materials to religious schools because “faced with the substantial amounts of direct support authorized by [the program], it would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania’s church-related elementary and secondary schools and then characterize [the program] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.” Id., at 365 .  See id., at 366 (“Substantial aid to the educational function of such schools ... necessarily results in aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole”); see also Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 783 ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 250-251 .  In Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , the Court asked whether the aid in question was a direct subsidy to religious schools and addressed the substantiality of the aid obliquely in noting that “nothing in the record indicates that.  .  .  any significant portion of the *899 aid expended under the Washington program as a whole will end up flowing to religious education.” In <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 12</citedDecision> , the Court spoke of the substantiality test in Meek , noting that “[disabled children, not sectarian schools, are the primary beneficiaries of the [Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA)]; to the extent sectarian schools benefit at all from the IDEA, they are only incidental beneficiaries.” C This stretch of doctrinal history leaves one point clear beyond peradventure: together with James Madison we have consistently understood the Establishment Clause to impose a substantive prohibition against public aid to religion and, hence, to the religious mission of sectarian schools.  Even-handedness neutrality is one, nondispositive pointer toward an intent and (to a lesser degree) probable effect on the permissible side of the line between forbidden aid and general public welfare benefit.  Other pointers are facts about the religious mission and education level of benefited schools and their pupils, the pathway by which a benefit travels from public treasury to educational effect, the form and content of the aid, its adaptability to religious ends, and its effects on school budgets.  The object of all enquiries into such matters is the same whatever the particular circumstances: is the benefit intended to aid in providing the religious element of the education and is it likely to do so?  The substance of the law has thus not changed since Ever-son.  Emphasis on one sort of fact or another has varied depending on the perceived utility of the enquiry, but all that has been added is repeated explanation of relevant considerations, confirming that our predecessors were right in their prophecies that no simple test would emerge to allow easy application of the establishment principle.  The plurality, however, would reject that lesson.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The concern with divertibility thus predicated is underscored by the fact that the religious schools in question here covered the primary and secondary grades, the grades in which the sectarian nature of instruction is characteristically the most pervasive, see Lemon, 403 U. S., at 616 ; cf. Tilton, 403 U. S., at 686-689 , and in which pupils are the least critical of the schools’ religious objectives, see Lemon, swpra, at 616.  No one, indeed, disputes the trial judge’s findings, based on a detailed record, that the Roman Catholic schools, 21 which made up the majority of the private schools participating, 22 were pervasively sectarian, 23 that *905 their common objective and mission was to engage in religious education, 24 and that their teachers taught religiously, 25 making them precisely the kind of primary and *906 secondary religious schools that Taise the most serious Establishment Clause concerns.  See Watz, 397 U. S., at 671 ; Hunt, 413 U. S., at 743 ; Lemon, supra, at 636-637 .  The threat to Establishment Clause values wáfe accordingly at its highest in the circumstances of this case. Such precautionary features as there were in the Jefferson Parish scheme were grossly inadequate to counter the threat.  To be sure, the disbursement of the aid was subject to statutory admonitions against diversion, see, e. g., 20 U. S. C. §§7332 , 8897, and was supposedly subject to a variety of safeguards, see ante, at 802-803, 832-834.  But the provisions for onsite monitoring visits, labeling of government property, and government oversight cannot be accepted as sufficient in the face of record evidence that the safeguard provisions proved to be empty phrases in Jefferson Parish.  Cf. Agos-tini, 521 U. S., at 228-229 ; Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 13</citedDecision> (accepting precautionary provisions in absence of evidence of them uselessness).  The plurality has already noted at length the ineffectiveness of the government’s monitoring program.  Ante, at 832-834; see also App. Illa (“A system to monitor nonpublie schools was often not in operation and therefore the [local educational agency] did not always know: (a) what was purchased or (b) how it was utilized”).  Monitors visited a non-publie school only sporadically, discussed the program with a single contact person, observed nothing more than attempts at recordkeeping, and failed to inform the teachers of the restrictions involved.  <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 154a-155a.  Although Chapter 2 required labeling of government property, it occurred haphazardly at best, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 113a, and the government’s sole monitoring system for computer use amounted to nothing more *907 than questioning school officials and examining the location of computers at the schools, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 118a.  No records of software and computer use were kept, and no such recordkeep-ing was even planned.  <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 118a, 164a-166a.  State and local officials in Jefferson Parish admitted that nothing prevented the Chapter 2 computers from being used for religious instruction, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 102a, 118a, 164a-166a, and although.  they knew of methods of monitoring computer usage, such as locking the computer functions, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 165a-166a, they implemented no particular policies, instituted no systems, and employed no technologies to minimize the likelihood of diversion to religious uses, 26 <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 118a, 165a-166a.  The watchdogs did require the religious schools to give not so much as an assurance that they would use Chapter 2 computers solely for secular purposes, Helms v. Picard, 151 F. 3d 347, 368 (1998), amended, 165 F. 3d 311 (CA5 1999); App. 94a-95a.  Government officials themselves admitted that there was no way to tell whether instructional materials had been diverted, id., at 118a, 139a, 144a-145a, and, as the plurality notes, the only screening mechanism in the library book scheme was a review of titles by a single government official, ante, at 832-833, n. 15; see App. 137a.  The government did not even have a policy on the consequences of noncompliance.  Id., at 145a.  The risk of immediate diversion of Chapter 2 benefits had its complement in the risk of future diversion, against which the Jefferson Parish program had absolutely no protection.  By statute all purchases with Chapter 2 aid were to remain the property of the United States, 20 U.S.C. §7372 (e)(1), merely being “lent” to the recipient nonpublic schools.
