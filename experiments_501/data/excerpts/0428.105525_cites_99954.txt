 Id., §4086.  Secretary of State Blaine referred to these consular powers as “greater than ever the Roman law conferred on the pro-consuls of the empire, to an officer who, under the terms of the commitment of this astounding trust, is practically irresponsible.” S. Exec. Doc. No. 21, 47th Cong., 1st Sess. 4.  Seward, at a time when he was Consul-General, declared: “[t]here is no reason, excepting the absence of appropriate legislation, why American citizens in China, charged with grave offenses, should not have the privilege of a trial by jury as elsewhere throughout the world where the institution of civilization prevails.” Id., at 7.  In re Ross, supra, at 464 .  Ibid. See cases cited in note 10, supra. See, e. g., Kawakita v. United States, 343 U. S. 717 ; United States v. Flores, 289 U. S. 137 ; United States v. Bowman, 260 U.

Bidwell, 182 U. S. 244 , the first of the “Insular Cases” was decided over vigorous dissents from Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, joined by Justices Harlan, Brewer, and Peckham, and from Mr. Justice Harlan separately.  The four dissenters took the position that all the restraints of the Bill of Rights and of other parts of the Constitution were applicable to the United States Government wherever it acted.  This was the position which the Court had consistently followed prior to the “Insular Cases.” See, e. g., Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 ; Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540 .

 We return, therefore, to the Ross question: to what extent do these provisions of the Constitution apply outside the United States?  As I have already stated, I do not think that it can be said that these safeguards of the Constitution are never operative without the United States, regardless of the particular circumstances.  On the other hand, I cannot agree with the suggestion that every provision of the Constitution must always be deemed automatically applicable to American citizens in every part of the world.  For Ross and the Insular Cases do stand for an important proposition, one which seems to me a wise and necessary gloss on our Constitution.  The proposition is, of course, not that the Constitution “does not apply” overseas, but that there are provisions in the Constitution which do not necessarily apply in all circumstances in every foreign place.  In other words, it seems to me that the basic teaching of Ross and the Insular Cases is that there is no rigid and abstract rule that Congress, as a condition precedent to exercising power over Americans overseas, must exercise it subject to all the guarantees of the Constitution, no matter what the conditions and considerations are that would make adherence to a specific guarantee altogether impracticable and anomalous.  To take but one example: Balzac v. Porto Rico, <citedDecision>258 U. S. 298</citedDecision> , is not good authority for the proposition that jury trials need never be provided for American citizens tried by *75 the United States abroad; but the case is good authority for the proposition that there is no rigid rule that jury trial must always be provided in the trial of an American overseas, if the circumstances are such that trial by jury would be impractical and anomalous.  In other words, what Ross and the Insular Cases hold is that the particular local setting, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives are relevant to a question of judgment, namely, whether jury trial should be deemed a necessary condition of the exercise of Congress’ power to provide for the trial of Americans overseas.  I think the above thought is crucial in approaching the cases before us.  Decision is easy if one adopts the constricting view that these constitutional guarantees as a totality do or do not “apply” overseas.  But, for me, the question is which guarantees of the Constitution should apply in view of the particular circumstances, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives which Congress had before it.  The question is one of judgment, not of compulsion.  And so I agree with my brother ErankfuRter that, in view of Ross and the Insular Cases, we have before us a question analogous, ultimately, to issues of due process; one can say, in fact, that-the question of which specific safeguards of the Constitution are appropriately to be applied in a particular context overseas can be reduced to the issue of what process is “due” a defendant in the particular circumstances of a particular case. On this basis, I cannot agree with the sweeping proposition that a full Article III trial, with indictment and trial by jury, is required in every case for the trial of a civilian dependent of a serviceman overseas.

 .  .  the trial should be in our courts.” I see no reason for not applying the same principle to any case where a civilian *78 dependent stands trial on pain of life itself.  The number of such cases would appear to be so negligible that the practical problems of affording the defendant a civilian trial would not present insuperable problems.  On this narrow ground I concur in the result in these cases. 50 U. S. C. § 552 (11).  The cases were argued on May 3, 1956, and decided on June 11, 1956.  Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 244 ; Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197 ; Dorr v. United States, 195 U. S. 138 ; Balzac v. Porto Rico, <citedDecision>258 U. S. 298</citedDecision> .  Article I, § 8, cl. 18 of the Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power “to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.” Thus, proposals to limit the size of the standing army in times of peace to a specific number of men in the Constitution were defeated at the Constitutional Convention.  See 5 Elliot’s Debates 442-443 (“no room for .  .  .  distrust of the representatives of the people”).

 They are transported at government expense, carry passports identifying them as service dependents, are admitted to the host country without visas, use military payment certificates, and receive the benefit of army postal facilities and privileges.  They enjoy the tax exemptions and customs benefits of the military.  They are treated at service hospitals, their children go to schools maintained by the Government, and they share with the military the recreational facilities provided by the Government.  They are housed and furnished heat, light, fuel, water, and telephone service by the military, as well as receiving transportation, food, and clothing from military sources.  This necessity is particularly acute with regard to peculiarly “military” and “local” offenses which must be dealt with swiftly and effectively.  Thus security regulations at these military installations must be enforced against civilian dependents as well as servicemen; the same is true of base traffic violations, black marketeering, and misuse of military customs and post-exchange privileges.  The practical circumstances requiring some sort of disciplinary jurisdiction have already been adverted <citedDecision>to, supra, pp. 71-73</citedDecision> .  These circumstances take on weight when viewed in light of the alternatives available to Congress — certainly a crucial question in weighing the need for dispensing with particular constitutional guarantees abroad.  What are these alternatives?  (1) One is to try all offenses committed by civilian dependents abroad in the United States.  But the practical problems in the way of such a choice are obvious and overwhelming.  To require the transportation home for trial of every petty black marketeer or violator of security regulations would be a ridiculous burden on the Government, quite aside from the problems of persuading foreign witnesses to make the' trip and of preserving evidence.  It can further be deemed doubtful in the extreme whether’foreign governments would permit crimes punishable under local law to be tried thousands of miles away in the United States.
