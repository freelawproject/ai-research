Rather, it limited the application of Ex Parte Young in the specific context of IGRA's enforcement scheme. The Court held that the doctrine of Ex Parte Young 'may not be used to enforce § 2710(d)(3) against a state official' because Congress created a specific remedial scheme in IGRA. This represents a limitation on Young's application in a particular statutory context, not an overruling of the doctrine itself. The Court explicitly acknowledges the continuing validity of the Ex Parte Young doctrine in other contexts.""
