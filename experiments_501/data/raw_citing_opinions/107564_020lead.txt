<author id="b458-6">Mr. Justice Stewart</author>
<p id="A9Y">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b458-7">The petitioner was convicted in the District Court for the Southern District of California under an eight-count indictment charging him with transmitting wagering information by telephone from Los Angeles to Miami and Boston, in violation of a federal statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial the Government was permitted, over the petitioner’s objection, to introduce evidence of the petitioner’s end of telephone conversations, overheard by FBI agents who had attached an electronic listening and recording device to the outside of the public telephone booth from which he had placed his calls. In affirming his conviction, the Court of Appeals rejected the contention that the recordings had been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index="1" label="349">*349</page-number>ment, because “[tjhere was no physical entrance into the area occupied by [the petitioner].”<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted certiorari in order to consider the constitutional questions thus presented.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b459-5">The petitioner has phrased those questions as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b459-6">“A. Whether a public telephone booth is a constitutionally protected area so that evidence obtained by attaching an electronic listening recording device to the top of such a booth is obtained in violation of the right to privacy of the user of the booth.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b460-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="350">*350</page-number>“B. Whether physical penetration of a constitutionally protected area is necessary before a search and seizure can be said to be violative of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”</blockquote>
<p id="b460-6">We decline to adopt this formulation of the issues. In the first place, the correct solution of Fourth Amendment problems is not necessarily promoted by incantation of the phrase “constitutionally protected area.” Secondly, the Fourth Amendment cannot be translated into a general constitutional “right to privacy.” That Amendment protects individual privacy against certain kinds of governmental intrusion, but its protections go further, and often have nothing to do with privacy at all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Other provisions of the Constitution protect personal privacy from other forms of governmental invasion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the protection of a person’s <em>general </em>right to privacy— his right to be let alone by other people<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> — is, like the <page-number citation-index="1" label="351">*351</page-number>protection of his property and of his very life, left largely to the law of the individual States.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b461-5">Because of the misleading way the issues have been formulated, the parties have attached great significance to the characterization of the telephone booth from which the petitioner placed his calls. The petitioner has strenuously argued that the booth was a “constitutionally protected area.” The Government has maintained with equal vigor that it was not.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But this effort to decide whether or not a given “area,” viewed in the abstract, is “constitutionally protected” deflects attention from the problem presented by this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107312"><a href="/opinion/107312/lewis-v-united-states/#210" aria-description="Citation for case: Lewis v.

Lee">274 U. S. 559, 563</a></span>. But what he seeks-to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally pro<page-number citation-index="1" label="352">*352</page-number>tected. See <em>Rios </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106108"><a href="/opinion/106108/rios-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rios v. United States">364 U. S. 253</a></span>; <em>Ex parte Jackson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="89759"><a href="/opinion/89759/ex-parte-jackson/#733" aria-description="Citation for case: Ex Parte Jackson">96 U. S. 727, 733</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b462-6">The Government stresses the fact that the telephone booth from which the petitioner made his calls was constructed partly of glass, so that he was as visible after he entered it as he would have been if he had remained outside. But what he sought to exclude when he entered the booth was not the intruding eye — it was the uninvited ear. He did not shed his right to do so simply because he made his calls from a place where he might be seen. No less than an individual in a business office,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in a friend’s apartment,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or in a taxicab,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a person in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the Fourth Amendment. One who occupies it, shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world. To read the Constitution more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the public telephone has come to play in private communication.</p>
<p id="b462-7">The Government contends, however, that the activities of its agents in this case should not be tested by Fourth Amendment requirements, for the surveillance technique they employed involved no physical penetration of the telephone booth from which the petitioner placed his calls. It is true that the absence of such penetration was at one time thought to foreclose further Fourth Amendment inquiry, <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101320"><a href="/opinion/101320/olmstead-v-united-states/#457" aria-description="Citation for case: Olmstead v. United States">277 U. S. 438, 457, 464, 466</a></span>; <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103664"><a href="/opinion/103664/goldman-v-united-states/#134" aria-description="Citation for case: Goldman v. United States">316 U. S. 129, 134-136</a></span>, for that Amendment was thought to limit only searches and seizures of tangible <page-number citation-index="1" label="353">*353</page-number>property.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But “[t]he premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.” <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107465"><a href="/opinion/107465/warden-maryland-penitentiary-v-hayden/#304" aria-description="Citation for case: Warden, Maryland Penitentiary v. Hayden">387 U. S. 294, 304</a></span>. Thus, although a closely divided Court supposed in <em><span class="citation" data-id="101320"><a href="/opinion/101320/olmstead-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Olmstead v. United States">Olmstead</a></span> </em>that surveillance without any trespass and without the seizure of any material object fell outside the ambit of the Constitution, we have since departed from the narrow view on which that decision rested. Indeed, we have expressly held that the Fourth Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements, overheard without any “technical trespass under . . . local property law.” <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106187"><a href="/opinion/106187/silverman-v-united-states/#511" aria-description="Citation for case: Silverman v. United States">365 U. S. 505, 511</a></span>. Once this much is acknowledged, and once it is recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects people— and not simply “areas” — against unreasonable searches and seizures, it becomes clear that the reach of that Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure.</p>
<p id="b463-5">We conclude that the underpinnings of <em><span class="citation" data-id="101320"><a href="/opinion/101320/olmstead-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Olmstead v. United States">Olmstead</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="103664"><a href="/opinion/103664/goldman-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Goldman v. United States">Goldman</a></span> </em>have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the “trespass” doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling. The Government’s activities in electronically listening to and recording the petitioner’s words violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied while using the telephone booth and thus constituted a “search and seizure” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The fact that the electronic device employed to achieve that end did not happen to penetrate the wall of the booth can have no constitutional significance.</p>
<p id="b464-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="354">*354</page-number>The question remaining for decision, then, is whether the search and seizure conducted in this case complied with constitutional standards. In that regard, the Government’s position is that its agents acted in an entirely defensible manner: They did not begin their electronic surveillance until investigation of the petitioner’s activities had established a strong probability that he was using the telephone in question to transmit gambling information to persons in other States, in violation of federal law. Moreover, the surveillance was limited, both in scope and in duration, to the specific purpose of establishing the contents of the petitioner’s unlawful telephonic communications. The agents confined their surveillance to the brief periods during which he used the telephone booth,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and they took great care to overhear only the conversations of the petitioner himself.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b464-6">Accepting this account of the Government’s actions as accurate, it is clear that this surveillance was so narrowly circumscribed that a duly authorized magistrate, properly notified of the need for such investigation, specifically informed of the basis on which it was to proceed, and clearly apprised of the precise intrusion it would entail, could constitutionally have authorized, with appropriate safeguards, the very limited search and seizure that the Government asserts in fact took place. Only last Term we sustained the validity of <page-number citation-index="1" label="355">*355</page-number>such an authorization, holding that, under sufficiently “precise and discriminate circumstances,” a federal court may empower government agents to employ a concealed electronic device “for the narrow and particularized purpose of ascertaining the truth of the . . . allegations” of a “detailed factual affidavit alleging the commission of a specific criminal offense.” <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107319"><a href="/opinion/107319/osborn-v-united-states/#329" aria-description="Citation for case: Osborn v. United States">385 U. S. 323, 329-330</a></span>. Discussing that holding, the Court in <em>Berger </em>v. <em>New York, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107483"><a href="/opinion/107483/berger-v-new-york/" aria-description="Citation for case: Berger v. New York">388 U. S. 41</a></span>, said that “the order authorizing the use of the electronic device” in <em><span class="citation" data-id="107319"><a href="/opinion/107319/osborn-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Osborn v. United States">Osborn</a></span> </em>“afforded similar protections to those ... of conventional warrants authorizing the seizure of tangible evidence.” Through those protections, “no greater invasion of privacy was permitted than was necessary under the circumstances.” <em>Id., </em>at 57.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Here, too, a similar <page-number citation-index="1" label="356">*356</page-number>judicial order could have accommodated “the legitimate needs of law enforcement” <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> by authorizing the carefully limited use of electronic surveillance.</p>
<p id="b466-6">The Government urges that, because its agents relied upon the decisions in <em><span class="citation" data-id="101320"><a href="/opinion/101320/olmstead-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Olmstead v. United States">Olmstead</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="103664"><a href="/opinion/103664/goldman-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Goldman v. United States">Goldman</a></span>, </em>and because they did no more here than they might properly have done with prior judicial sanction, we should retroactively validate their conduct. That we cannot do. It is apparent that the agents in this case acted with restraint. Yet the inescapable fact is that this restraint was imposed by the agents themselves, not by a judicial officer. They were not required, before commencing the search, to present their estimate of probable cause for detached scrutiny by a neutral magistrate. They were not compelled, during the conduct of the search itself, to observe precise limits established in advance by a specific court order. Nor were they directed, after the search had been completed, to notify the authorizing magistrate in detail of all that had been seized. In the absence of such safeguards, this Court has never sustained a search upon the sole ground that officers reasonably expected to find evidence of a particular crime and voluntarily confined their activities to the least intrusive <page-number citation-index="1" label="357">*357</page-number>means consistent with that end. Searches conducted without warrants have been held unlawful “notwithstanding facts unquestionably showing probable cause,” <em>Agnello </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="100711"><a href="/opinion/100711/agnello-v-united-states/#33" aria-description="Citation for case: Agnello v. United States">269 U. S. 20, 33</a></span>, for the Constitution requires “that the deliberate, impartial judgment of a judicial officer ... be interposed between the citizen and the police . . ..” <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106515"><a href="/opinion/106515/wong-sun-v-united-states/#481" aria-description="Citation for case: Wong Sun v. United States">371 U. S. 471, 481-82</a></span>. “Over and again this Court has emphasized that the mandate of the [Fourth] Amendment requires adherence to judicial processes,” <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jeffers, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104932"><a href="/opinion/104932/united-states-v-jeffers/#51" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Jeffers">342 U. S. 48, 51</a></span>, and that searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> — subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b467-5">It is difficult to imagine how any of those exceptions could ever apply to the sort of search and seizure involved in this case. Even electronic surveillance substantially contemporaneous with an individual’s arrest could hardly be deemed an “incident” of that arrest.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="358">*358</page-number>Nor could the use of electronic surveillance without prior authorization be justified on grounds of “hot pursuit.” <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> And, of course, the very nature of electronic surveillance precludes its use pursuant to the suspect’s consent.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b468-6">The Government does not question these basic principles. Rather, it urges the creation of a new exception to cover this case.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It argues that surveillance of a telephone booth should be exempted from the usual requirement of advance authorization by a magistrate upon a showing of probable cause. We cannot agree. Omission of such authorization</p>
<blockquote id="b468-7">“bypasses the safeguards provided by an objective predetermination of probable cause, and substitutes instead the far less reliable procedure of an after-the-event justification for the . . . search, too likely to be subtly influenced by the familiar shortcomings of hindsight judgment.” <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106936"><a href="/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/#96" aria-description="Citation for case: Beck v. Ohio">379 U. S. 89, 96</a></span>.</blockquote>
<p id="b468-8">And bypassing a neutral predetermination of the <em>scope </em>of a search leaves individuals secure from Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index="1" label="359">*359</page-number>ment violations “only in the discretion of the police.” <span class="citation" data-id="106936"><a href="/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/#97" aria-description="Citation for case: Beck v. Ohio"><em>Id., </em>at 97</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b469-5">These considerations do not vanish when the search in question is transferred from the setting of a home, an office, or a hotel room to that of a telephone booth. Wherever a man may be, he is entitled to know that he will remain free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The government agents here ignored “the procedure of antecedent justification . . . that is central to the Fourth Amendment,” <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> a procedure that we hold to be a constitutional precondition of the kind of electronic surveillance involved in this case. Because the surveillance here failed to meet that condition, and because it led to the petitioner’s conviction, the judgment must be reversed.</p>

<p id="b464-7"> Based upon their previous visual observations of the petitioner, the agents correctly predicted that he would use the telephone booth for several minutes at approximately the same time each morning. The petitioner was subjected to electronic surveillance only during this predetermined period. Six recordings, averaging some three minutes each, were obtained and admitted in evidence. They preserved the petitioner’s end of conversations concerning the placing of bets and the receipt of wagering information.</p>

A conventional warrant ordinarily serves to notify the suspect of an intended search. But if Osborn had been told in advance that federal officers intended to record his conversations, the point of making such recordings would obviously have been lost; the evidence in question could not have been obtained. In omitting any requirement of advance notice, the federal court that authorized electronic surveillance in <em><span class="citation" data-id="107319"><a href="/opinion/107319/osborn-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Osborn v. United States">Osborn</a></span> </em>simply recognized, as has this Court, that officers need not announce their purpose before conducting an otherwise authorized search if such an announcement would provoke the escape of the suspect or the destruction of critical evidence. See <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106641"><a href="/opinion/106641/ker-v-california/#37" aria-description="Citation for case: Ker v. California">374 U.

<p id="b465-6">Although some have thought that this “exception to the notice requirement where exigent circumstances are present,” <span class="citation" data-id="106641"><a href="/opinion/106641/ker-v-california/#39" aria-description="Citation for case: Ker v. California"><em>id., </em>at 39</a></span>, should be deemed inapplicable where police enter a home before its occupants are aware that officers are present, <span class="citation" data-id="106641"><a href="/opinion/106641/ker-v-california/#55" aria-description="Citation for case: Ker v. California"><em>id., </em>at 55-58</a></span> (opinion of Mr. Justice BrenNAN), the reasons for such a limitation have no bearing here. However true it may be that “[i]nnocent citizens should not suffer the shock, fright or embarrassment attendant upon an unannounced police intrusion,” <span class="citation" data-id="106641"><a href="/opinion/106641/ker-v-california/#57" aria-description="Citation for case: Ker v.

<p id="b466-8">Nor do the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure impose an inflexible requirement of prior notice. Rule 41 (d) does require federal officers to serve upon the person searched a copy of the warrant and a receipt describing the material obtained, but it does not invariably require that this be done before the search takes place. <em>Nordelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1497017"><a href="/opinion/1497017/nordelli-v-united-states/#666" aria-description="Citation for case: Nordelli v.
