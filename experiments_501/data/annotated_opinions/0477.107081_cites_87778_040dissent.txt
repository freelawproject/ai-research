**Dissenting Opinion**
Me. Justice White, with whom Mr. Justice Clark, Mr. Justice Harlan, and Mr. Justice Stewart join, dissenting.  “A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial.” Cummings v. Missouri, <citedDecision>4 Wall. 277, 323</citedDecision> .  When an enactment is challenged as an attainder, the central inquiry must be whether the disability imposed by the act is “punishment”, (i.  e., is directed at an individual or a group of individuals) or is “regulation” (i.  e., is directed at controlling future conduct).  Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, at 613-614 ; accord, Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 95-96 (Warren, C. J., announcing judgment).  Whether a punitive purpose would be inferred has depended in past cases on a number of circumstances, including the nature of the disability, whether it was traditionally regarded as punishment, whether it is rationally connected to a permissible legislative objective, as well as the specificity of the legisla *463 ture’s designation of the persons to be affected.  See generally Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martines, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 .

 Admittedly the degree of specificity is a relevant factor — as when individuals are singled out by name — but because in many instances specificity of the degree here held impermissible may be wholly consistent with a regulatory, rather than a punitive purpose, the Court’s per se approach cuts too broadly and invalidates legitimate legislative activity.  IV. Putting aside the Court’s per se approach based on the nature of the classification specified by the legislation, we must still test § 504 against the traditional definition of the bill of attainder as legislative punishment of particular individuals.  In my view, § 504 does not impose punishment and is not a bill of attainder.  *476 We have said that “only the clearest proof could suffice” to establish that Congress’ purpose was punitive rather than regulatory.  Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 .  A punitive purpose has been found when it could be said that a statute passed amid the fierce passions aroused by the Civil War bore no rational connection to any permissible legislative purpose.  Cummings v. Missouri, <citedDecision>4 Wall. 277, 319, 322</citedDecision> ; see Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114, 128 ; Hawker v. New York, 170 U. S. 189, 198 .  The imposition of a particularly harsh deprivation without any discernible legitimate legislative purpose has similarly been characterized as penal.  Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (Warren, C. J., announcing judgment).  Similarly a punitive purpose has been found when such a purpose clearly appeared in the legislative history.  Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martines, 372 U. S. 144, 169 ; United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 308-314 .  In other cases the analysis is more difficult.  We summarized the relevant considerations in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, supra: “Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment— retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose u) which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions.” 372 TJ. S., at 168-169.
