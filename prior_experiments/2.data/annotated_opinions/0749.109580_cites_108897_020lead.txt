The State brought an ejectment action against Corvallis Sand, seeking to recover 11 separate parcels of riverbed, as well as damages for the use of the parcels. The State’s complaint alleged that by virtue of its sovereignty it was the owner in fee simple of the disputed portions of the riverbed, and that it was entitled to immediate possession and damages. Corvallis Sand denied the State’s ownership of the bed. *366 Each party was partially successful in the Oregon courts, 1 and we granted cross petitions for certiorari. 423 U. S. 1048. Those courts understandably felt that our recent decision in Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 414 U. S. 313 (1973), required that they ascertain and apply principles of federal common law to the controversy. Twenty-six States have joined in three amicus briefs urging that we reconsider <targetCase>Bonelli, supra</targetCase>, because of what they assert is its significant departure from long-established precedent in this Court. I The nature of the litigation and the contentions of the parties may be briefly stated. Title to two distinct portions of land has been at issue throughout. The first of these portions has apparently been within the bed of the Willamette River since Oregon’s admission into the Union. The other portion of the land underlies the river in an area known as Fischer Cut, which was not a part of the riverbed at the time Oregon was admitted to the Union. The trial'court found that prior to a flood which occurred in November 1909, the Willamette flowed around a peninsula-like formation known as Fischer Island, but that by 1890 a clearly discernible overflow channel across the neck of the peninsula had developed. Before 1909 this channel carried *367 the flow of the river only at its intermediate or high stages, and the main channel of the river continued to flow around Fischer Island.
