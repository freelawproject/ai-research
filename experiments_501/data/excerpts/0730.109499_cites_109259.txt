 The court went on to say that it considered their contentions “substantial and that it may well be that the Supreme Court will feel it appropriate to draw back from the far-reaching implications of [Maryland v. Wirtz, supra]; but that is a decision that only the Supreme Court can make, and as a Federal district court we feel obliged to apply the Wirtz opinion as it stands.” National League of Cities v. Brennan, 406 F. Supp, 826, 828 (DC 1974).  *840 We noted probable jurisdiction in order to consider the important questions recognized by the District Court. 420 U. S. 906 (1975).  11 We agree with the District Court that the appellants' contentions are substantial.  Indeed upon full consideration of the question we have decided that the “far-reaching implications” of Wirtz should be overruled, and that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed.  II It is established beyond peradventure that the Commerce Clause of Art. I of the Constitution is a grant of plenary authority to Congress.  That authority is, in the words of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), “the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.” Id., at 196.  When considering the validity of asserted applications of this power to wholly private activity, the Court has made it clear that “[e]ven activity that is purely intrastate in char^ acter may be regulated by Congress, where the activity, combined with like conduct by others similarly situated, affects commerce among the States or with foreign nations.” Fry v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 542, 547</citedDecision> (1975).  Congressional power over areas of private endeavor, even when its exercise may pre-empt express state-law determinations contrary to the result which has commended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress, has been held to be limited only by the requirement that “the means chosen by [Congress] must be reasonably adapted to the end permitted by the Constitution.” Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 262 (1964).  *841 Appellants in no way challenge these decisions establishing the breadth of authority granted Congress under the commerce power.  Their contention, on the contrary, is that when Congress seeks to regulate directly the activities of States as public employers, it transgresses an affirmative limitation on the exercise of its power akin to other commerce power affirmative limitations contained in the Constitution.  Congressional enactments which may be fully within the grant of legislative authority contained in the Commerce Clause may nonetheless be invalid because found to offend against the right to trial by jury contained in the Sixth Amendment, United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570 (1968), or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6 (1969).  Appellants’ essential contention is that the 1974 amendments to the Act, while undoubtedly within the scope of the Commerce Clause, encounter a similar constitutional barrier because they are to be applied directly to the States and subdivisions of States as employers.  12 *842 This Court has never doubted that there are limits upon the power of Congress to override state sovereignty, even when exercising its otherwise plenary powers to tax or to regulate commerce which are conferred- by Art. I of the Constitution.

 .  .  'the utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity/ ” which they feared.  392 U. S., at 196 .  Appellee Secretary in this case, both in his brief and upon oral argument, has agreed that our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.  See, e. g., Brief for Appellee 30-41; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-43.  In <citedDecision>Fry, supra,</citedDecision> the Court recognized that an express declaration of this limitation is found in the Tenth Amendment: “While the Tenth Amendment has been characterized as a 'truism/ stating merely that 'all is retained which has not been surrendered,' United States v. *843 Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 124 (1941), it is not without significance.  The Amendment expressly declares the constitutional policy that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States’ integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.” <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 547</citedDecision> n. 7.  In New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), Mr. Chief Justice Stone, speaking for four Members of an eight-Member Court 13 in rejecting the proposition that Congress could impose taxes on the States so long as it did so in a nondiscriminatory manner, observed: “A State may, like a private individual, own real property and receive income.  But in view of our former decisions we could hardly say that a general non-discriminatory real estate tax (apportioned), or an income tax laid upon citizens and States alike could be constitutionally applied to the State’s capitol, its State-house, its public school houses, public parks, or its revenues from taxes or school lands, even though all real property and all income of the citizen .is taxed.” Id., at 587-588 .  14 *844 The expressions in these more recent cases trace back to earlier decisions of this Court recognizing the essential role of the States in our federal system of government.  Mr. Chief Justice Chase, perhaps because of the particular time at which he occupied that office, had occasion more than once to speak for the Court on this point.  In Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869), he declared that “[t]he Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.” In Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 (1869), his opinion for the Court said: “Both the States and the United States existed before the Constitution.  The people, through that instrument, established a more perfect union by substituting a national government, acting, with ample power, directly upon the citizens, instead of the Confederate government, which acted with powers, greatly restricted, only upon the States.

 We do not believe particularized assessments of actual impact are crucial to resolution of the issue presented, however.  For even if we accept appellee's assessments concerning the impact of the amendments, their application will nonetheless significantly alter or displace the States' abilities to structure employer-employee relationships in such areas as fire prevention, police protection, sanitation, public health, and parks and recreation.  These activities are typical of those performed by state and local governments in discharging their dual functions of administering the public law and furnishing public services.  16 Indeed, it is functions such as these which governments are created to provide, services such as these which the States have traditionally afforded their citizens.  If Congress may withdraw from the States the authority to make those fundamental employment decisions upon which their systems for performance of these functions must rest, we think there would be little left of the States’ “ ‘separate and independent existence.’ ” Coyle, 221 U. S., at 580 .  Thus, even if appellants may have overestimated the effect which the Act will have upon *852 their current levels and patterns of governmental activity, the dispositive factor is that Congress has attempted to exercise its Commerce Clause authority to prescribe minimum wages and maximum hours to be paid by the States in their capacities as sovereign governments.  In so doing, Congress has sought to wield its power in a fashion that would impair the States' “ability to function effectively in a federal system,” Fry, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 547</citedDecision> n. 7.  This exercise of congressional authority does not comport with the federal system of government embodied in the Constitution.  We hold that insofar as the challenged amendments operate to directly displace the States’ freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions, they are not within the authority granted Congress by Art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  17 Ill One final matter requires our attention.  Appellee has vigorously urged that we cannot, consistently with the Court’s decisions in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968), and <citedDecision>Fry, supra,</citedDecision> rule against him here.  It is important to examine this contention so that it will be clear what we hold today, and what we do not.  With regard to <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> , we disagree with appellee.  There the Court held that the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 was constitutional as applied to temporarily freeze the wages of state and local government employees.  The Court expressly noted that the degree of intrusion upon the protected area of state sovereignty was in that case *853 even less than that worked by the amendments to the FLSA which were before the Court in Wirtz .  The Court recognized that the Economic Stabilization Act was “an emergency measure to counter severe inflation that threatened the national economy.” <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 548</citedDecision> .  We think our holding today quite consistent with <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> .  The enactment at issue there was occasioned by an extremely serious problem which endangered the well-being of all the component parts of our federal system and which only collective action by the National Government might forestall.  The means selected were carefully drafted so as not to interfere with the States’ freedom beyond a very limited, specific period of time.  The effect of the across-the-board freeze authorized by that Act, moreover, displaced no state choices as to how governmental operations should be structured, nor did it force the States to remake such choices themselves.  Instead, it merely required that the wage scales and employment relationships which the States themselves had chosen be maintained during the period of the emergency.  Finally, the Economic Stabilization Act operated to reduce the pressures upon state budgets rather than increase them.  These factors distinguish the statute in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> from the provisions at issue here.  The limits imposed upon the commerce power when Congress seeks to apply it to the States are not so inflexible as to preclude temporary enactments tailored to combat a national emergency.  “[Although an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived, nevertheless emergency may afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed.” Wilson v. New, 243 U. S. 332, 348 (1917).  With respect to the Court’s decision in Wirtz , we reach a different conclusion.  Both appellee and the District Court thought that decision required rejection of appel *854 lants’ claims.  Appellants, in turn, advance several arguments by which they seek to distinguish the facts before the Court in Wirtz from those presented by the 1974 amendments to the Act.  There are undoubtedly factual distinctions between the two situations, but in view of the conclusions expressed earlier in this opinion we do not believe the reasoning in Wirtz may any longer be regarded as authoritative.
