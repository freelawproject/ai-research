**Dissenting Opinion**
 And there is very little in the surrounding circumstances of the adoption of the Fifth Amendment or in the provisions of the then existing state constitutions or in state practice which would give the constitutional provision any broader meaning.  Mayers, The Federal Witness’ Privilege Against Self-Incrimination: Constitutional or Common-Law?  4 American Journal of Legal History 107 (1960).  Such a construction, however, was considerably narrower than the privilege at common law, and when eventually faced with the issues, the Court extended the constitutional privilege to the compulsory production of books and papers, to the ordinary witness before the grand jury and to witnesses generally.  Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616 , and Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547 .  Both rules had solid support in common-law history, if not in the history of our own constitutional provision.  A few years later the Fifth Amendment privilege was similarly extended to encompass the then well-established rule against coerced confessions: “In criminal trials, in the courts of the United States, wherever a question arises whether a confession is incompetent because not voluntary, the issue is controlled by that portion of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, commanding that no person ‘shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.’ ” Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532, 542</citedDecision> .  Although this view has found approval in other cases, Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U. S. 465, 475 ; Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303, 313 ; Shotwell v. United States, 371 U. S. 341, 347 , it has also been questioned, see Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278, 285 ; United States v. Carignan, *528 342 U. S. 36, 41 ; Stein v. New York, 346 U. S. 156, 191, n. 35 , and finds scant support in either the English or American authorities, see generally Regina v. Scott, Dears.  & Bell 47; 3 Wigmore, Evidence § 823 (3d ed. 1940), at 249 (“a confession is not rejected because of any connection with the privilege against self-crimination”), and 250, n. 5 (particularly criticizing Bram); 8 Wigmore, Evidence § 2266, at 400-40.1 (McNaughton rev. 1961).  Whatever the source of the rule excluding coerced confessions, it is clear that prior to the application of the privilege itself to state courts, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 , the admissibility of a confession in a state criminal prosecution was tested by the same standards as were applied in federal prosecutions.  Id., at 6-7, 10 .  <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> , however, itself rejected the proposition which the Court now espouses.  The question in <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> was whether a confession, obtained during custodial interrogation, had been compelled, and if such interrogation was to be deemed inherently vulnerable the Court’s inquiry could have ended there.  After examining the English and American authorities, however, the Court declared that: “In this court also it has been settled that the mere fact that the confession is made to a police officer, while the accused was under arrest in or out of .prison, or was drawn out by his questions, does not necessarily render the confession involuntary, but, as one of the circumstances, such imprisonment or interrogation may be taken into account in determining whether or not the statements of the prisoner were voluntary.” <citedDecision>168 U. S., at 558</citedDecision> .  In this respect the Court was wholly consistent with prior and subsequent pronouncements in this Court. Thus prior to <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> the Court, in Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 583-587 , had upheld the admissibility of a *529 confession made to police officers following arrest, the record being silent concerning what conversation had occurred between the officers and the defendant in the short period preceding the confession.  Relying on Hopt , the Court ruled squarely on the issue in Sparf and Hansen v. United States, 156 U. S. 51 , 55: “Counsel for the accused insist that there cannot be a voluntary statement, a free open confession, while a defendant is confined and in irons under an accusation of having committed a capital offence.  We have not been referred to any authority in support of that position.  It is true that the fact of a prisoner being in custody at the time he makes a confession is a circumstance not to be overlooked, because it bears upon the inquiry whether the confession was voluntarily made or was extorted by threats or violence or made under the influence of fear.  But confinement or imprisonment is not in itself sufficient to justify the exclusion of a confession, if it appears to have been voluntary, and was not obtained by putting the prisoner in fear or by promises.  Wharton’s Cr. Ev. 9th ed. §§ 661, 663, and authorities cited.” Accord, Pierce v. United States, 160 U. S. 355, 357 .  And in Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 623 , the Court had considered the significance of custodial interrogation without any antecedent warnings regarding the right to remain silent or the right to counsel.  There the defendant had answered questions posed by a Commissioner, who had failed to advise him of his rights, and his answers were held admissible over his claim of involuntariness.  “The fact that [a defendant] is in custody and manacled does not necessarily render his statement involuntary, nor is that necessarily the effect of popular excitement shortly preceding.  .  .  .  And it is laid down *530 that it is not essential to the admissibility of a confession that it should appear that the person was warned that what he said would be used against him, but on the contrary, if the confession was voluntary, it is sufficient though it appear that he was not so warned.” Since <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> , the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation has been frequently reiterated.  Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303 , cited Wilson approvingly and held admissible as voluntary statements the accused’s testimony at a preliminary hearing even though he was not warned that what he said might be used against him.  Without any discussion of the presence or absence of warnings, presumably because such discussion was deemed unnecessary, numerous other cases have declared that “[t]he mere fact that a confession was made while in the custody of the police does not render it inadmissible,” McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, 346 ; accord, United States v. Mitchell, 322 U. S. 65 , despite its having been elicited by police examination, Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14 ; United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 39 .  Likewise, in Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 437 , the Court said that “the bare fact of police ‘detention and police examination in private of one in official state custody’ does not render involuntary a confession by the one so detained.” And finally, in Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , a confession obtained by police interrogation after arrest was held voluntary even though the authorities refused to permit the defendant to consult with his attorney.  See generally Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 587-602 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); 3 Wigmore, Evidence § 851, at 313 (3d ed. 1940); see also Joy, Admissibility of Confessions 38, 46 (1842).  Only a tiny minority of our judges who have dealt with the question, including today’s majority, have considered in-custody interrogation, without more, to be a violation of the Fifth Amendment.  And this Court, as *531 every member knows, has left standing literally thousands of criminal convictions that rested at least in part on confessions taken in the course of interrogation by the police after arrest.
