**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice White, dissenting.  I would not overrule Robbins v. California, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 420</citedDecision> (1981).  For the reasons stated by Justice Stewart in that *827 case, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I also agree with much of Justice Marshallâ€™s dissent in this case.
