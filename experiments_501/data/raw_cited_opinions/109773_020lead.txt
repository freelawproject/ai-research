<author id="b670-7">Mr. Justice Stevens</author>
<p id="APf">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b670-8">An Arizona trial judge granted the prosecutor’s motion for a mistrial predicated on improper and prejudicial comment during defense counsel’s opening statement. In a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding, a Federal District Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause protected the defendant from another trial. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The questions presented are whether the record reflects the kind of “necessity” for the mistrial ruling that will avoid a valid plea of double jeopardy, and if so, whether the plea must nevertheless be allowed because the Arizona trial judge did not fully explain the reasons for his mistrial ruling.</p>
<p id="b670-9">I</p>
<p id="b670-10">In 1971 respondent was found guilty of murdering a hotel night clerk. In 1973, the Superior Court of Pima County, Ariz., ordered a new trial because the prosecutor had withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the new trial order in an unpublished opinion.</p>
<p id="b670-11">Respondent’s second trial began in January 1975. During the <em>voir dire </em>examination of prospective jurors, the prosecutor made reference to the fact that some of the witnesses whose testimony the jurors would hear had testified in proceedings <page-number citation-index="1" label="499">*499</page-number>four years earlier.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel told the prospective jurors “that there was evidence hidden from [respondent] at the last trial.” In his opening statement, he made this point more forcefully:</p>
<blockquote id="b671-5">“You will hear testimony that notwithstanding the fact that we had a trial in May of 1971 in this matter, that the prosecutor hid those statements and didn’t give those to the lawyer for George saying the man was Spanish speaking, didn’t give those statements at all, hid them.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b671-6">“You will hear that that evidence was suppressed and hidden by the prosecutor in that case. You will hear that that evidence was purposely withheld. You will hear that because of the misconduct of the County Attorney at that time and because he withheld evidence, that the Supreme Court of Arizona granted a new trial in this case.” App. 180-181, 184.</blockquote>
<p id="b671-7">After opening statements were completed, the prosecutor moved for a mistrial. In colloquy during argument of the motion, the trial judge expressed the opinion that evidence concerning the reasons for the new trial, and specifically the ruling of the Arizona Supreme Court, was irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence and therefore inadmissible. Defense counsel asked for an opportunity “to find some law” that would support his belief that the Supreme Court opinion would be admissible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After further argument, the judge stated that <page-number citation-index="1" label="500">*500</page-number>he would withhold ruling on the admissibility of the evidence and denied the motion for mistrial. Two witnesses then testified.</p>
<p id="b672-5">The following morning the prosecutor renewed his mistrial motion. Fortified by an evening’s research, he argued that there was no theory on which the basis for the new trial ruling could be brought to the attention of the jury, that the prejudice to the jury could not be repaired by any cautionary instructions, and that a mistrial was a “manifest necessity.” Defense counsel stated that he still was not prepared with authority supporting his belief that the Supreme Court opinion was admissible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He argued that his comment was invited by the prosecutor’s reference to the witnesses’ earlier testimony <page-number citation-index="1" label="501">*501</page-number>and that any prejudice could be avoided by curative instructions. During the extended argument, the trial judge expressed his concern about the possibility that an erroneous mistrial ruling would preclude another trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b673-5">Ultimately the trial judge granted the motion, stating that his ruling was based upon defense counsel’s remarks in his opening statement concerning the Arizona Supreme Court opinion. The trial judge did not expressly find that there was “manifest necessity” for a mistrial; nor did he expressly state that he had considered alternative solutions and concluded that none would be adequate. The Arizona Supreme Court refused to review the mistrial ruling.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b673-6">Respondent then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleging that another trial would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. After reviewing the transcript of the state proceeding, and hearing the arguments of counsel, the Federal District Judge noted that the Arizona trial judge had not canvassed on the record the possibility of alternatives to a mistrial and expressed the view that before granting a mistrial motion the judge was required “to find that manifest necessity exists for the granting of it.” <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the record contained no such finding, and because the federal judge was not prepared to <page-number citation-index="1" label="502">*502</page-number>make such a finding himself, he granted the writ.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He agreed with the State, however, that defense counsel’s opening statement had been improper.</p>
<p id="b674-5">The Ninth Circuit also characterized the opening statement as improper, but affirmed because, absent a finding of manifest necessity or an explicit consideration of alternatives,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the court was unwilling to infer that the jury was prevented from arriving at a fair and impartial verdict.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In a concurring opinion, two judges noted that, while the question of manifest necessity had been argued, most of the argument on the mistrial motion had concerned the question whether the opening statement was improper. They concluded that, “absent findings that manifest necessity existed, it . . . '[was] quite possible that the grant of mistrial was based on the fact that the impropriety of counsel’s conduct had been established <page-number citation-index="1" label="503">*503</page-number>without reaching the question whether there could, nevertheless, be a fair trial.” 546 F. 2d, at 833.</p>
<p id="b675-5">We are persuaded that the Court of Appeals applied an inappropriate standard of review to mistrial rulings of this kind, and attached undue significance to the form of the ruling. We therefore reverse.</p>
<p id="b675-6">II</p>
<p id="b675-7">A State may not put a defendant in jeopardy twice for the same offense. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U. S. 784. The constitutional protection against double jeopardy unequivocally prohibits a second trial following an acquittal. The public interest in the finality of criminal judgments is so strong that an acquitted defendant may not be retried even though “the acquittal was based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.” See <em>Fong Foo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>369 U. S. 141, 143. If the innocence of the accused has been confirmed by a final judgment, the Constitution conclusively presumes that a second trial would be unfair.</p>
<p id="b675-8">Because jeopardy attaches before the judgment becomes final, the constitutional protection also embraces the defendant’s “valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.”<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The reasons why this “valued right” merits constitutional protection are worthy of repetition. Even if the first trial is not completed, a second prosecution may be grossly unfair. It increases the financial and emotional burden <page-number citation-index="1" label="504">*504</page-number>on the accused,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The danger of such unfairness to the defendant exists whenever a trial is aborted before it is completed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="505">*505</page-number>Consequently, as a general rule, the prosecutor is entitled to one, and only one, opportunity to require an accused to stand trial.</p>
<p id="b677-5">Unlike the situation in which the trial has ended in an acquittal or conviction, retrial is not automatically barred when a criminal proceeding is terminated without finally resolving the merits of the charges against the accused. Because of the variety of circumstances that may make it necessary to discharge a jury before a trial is concluded, and because those circumstances do not invariably create unfairness to the accused, his valued right to have the trial concluded by a particular tribunal is sometimes subordinate to the public interest in affording the prosecutor one full and fair opportunity to present his evidence to an impartial jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Yet in view of the importance of the right, and the fact that it is frustrated by any mistrial, the prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar. His burden is a heavy one. The prosecutor must demonstrate “manifest necessity” for any mistrial declared over the objection of the defendant.</p>
<p id="b677-6">The words “manifest necessity” appropriately characterize the magnitude of the prosecutor’s burden.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For that reason <page-number citation-index="1" label="506">*506</page-number>Mr. Justice Story’s classic formulation of the test<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> has been quoted over and over again to provide guidance in the decision of a wide variety of cases.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nevertheless, those words do not describe a standard that can be applied mechanically or without attention to the particular problem confronting the trial judge.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Indeed, it is manifest that the key word “necessity” cannot be interpreted literally; instead, contrary to the teaching of Webster, we assume that there are degrees of necessity and we require a “high degree” before concluding that a mistrial is appropriate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b679-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="507">*507</page-number>The question whether that “high degree” has been reached is answered more easily in some kinds of cases than in others. At one extreme are cases in which a prosecutor requests a mistrial in order to buttress weaknesses in his evidence. Although there was a time when English judges served the Stuart monarchs by exercising a power to discharge a jury whenever it appeared that the Crown’s evidence would be insufficient to convict,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the prohibition against double jeop<page-number citation-index="1" label="508">*508</page-number>ardy as it evolved in this country was plainly intended to condemn this “abhorrent” practice.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As this Court noted in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U. S. 600, 611:</p>
<blockquote id="b680-5">“The Double Jeopardy Clause does protect a defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby to subject defendants to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions. It bars retrials where ‘bad-faith conduct by judge or prosecutor’ . . . threatens the ‘[hjarassment of an accused by successive prosecutions or declaration of a mistrial so as to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict’ the defendant.”</blockquote>
<p id="b680-6">Thus, the strictest scrutiny is appropriate when the basis for the mistrial is the unavailability of critical prosecution evidence,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or when there is reason to believe that the prosecutor is using the superior resources of the State to harass or to achieve a tactical advantage over the accused.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b681-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="509">*509</page-number>At the other extreme is the mistrial premised upon the trial judge's belief that the jury is unable to peach a verdict, long considered the classic basis for a proper mistrial.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The argument that a jury’s inability to agree establishes reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt, and therefore requires acquittal, has been uniformly rejected in this country. Instead, without exception, the courts have held that the trial judge may discharge a genuinely deadlocked jury and require the defendant to submit to a second trial. This rule accords recognition to society’s interest in giving the prosecution one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws.</p>
<p id="b681-5">Moreover, in this situation there are especially compelling reasons for allowing the trial judge to exercise broad discretion in deciding whether or not “manifest necessity” justifies a discharge of the jury. On the one hand, if he discharges the jury when further deliberations may produce a fair verdict, the defendant is deprived of his “valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.” But if he fails to discharge a jury which is unable to reach a verdict after protracted and exhausting deliberations, there exists a significant risk that a verdict may result from pressures inherent in the situation rather than the considered judgment of all the jurors. If retrial of the defendant were barred whenever an appellate <page-number citation-index="1" label="510">*510</page-number>court views the “necessity” for a mistrial differently from the trial judge, there would be a danger that the latter, cognizant of the serious societal consequences of air erroneous ruling, would employ coercive means to break the apparent deadlock. Such a rule would frustrate the public interest in just judgments.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The trial judge’s decision to declare a mistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is therefore accorded great deference by a reviewing court.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b682-5">We are persuaded that, along the spectrum of trial problems which may warrant a mistrial and which vary in their amenability to appellate scrutiny, the difficulty which led to the mistrial in this case also falls in an area where the trial judge’s determination is entitled to special respect.</p>
<p id="b682-6">In this case the trial judge ordered a mistrial because the defendant’s lawyer made improper and prejudicial remarks during his opening statement to the jury. Although respond<page-number citation-index="1" label="511">*511</page-number>ent insists that evidence of prosecutorial misconduct<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> was admissible as a matter of Arizona law, and therefore that the opening statement was proper, we regard this issue as foreclosed by respondent’s failure to proffer any Arizona precedent supportive of his contention <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and by the state court’s interpretation of its own law, buttressed by the consistent opinion of the Federal District Court and the Court of Appeals. Cf. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U. S. 341, 346-347. We therefore start from the premise that defense counsel’s comment was improper and may have affected the impartiality of the jury.</p>
<p id="b683-5">We recognize that the extent of the possible bias cannot be measured, and that the District Court was quite correct in believing that some trial judges might have proceeded with the trial after giving the jury appropriate cautionary instructions. In a strict, literal sense, the mistrial was not “necessary.” Nevertheless, the overriding interest in the evenhanded administration of justice requires that we accord the highest degree of respect to the trial judge’s evaluation of the likelihood that the impartiality of one or more jurors may have been affected by the improper comment.</p>
<p id="b684-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="512">*512</page-number>The consistent course of decision in this Court in cases involving possible juror bias supports this conclusion. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>142 U. S. 148, involved the possibility of bias caused by a newspaper story describing a letter written by defense counsel denying a charge by a third party that one of the jurors was acquainted with the defendant. Without determining the truth or falsity of the charge, and without examining the jurors to ascertain what influence the story had upon them, the trial judge declared a mistrial because he considered it “ ‘impossible that in the future consideration of this case by the jury there can be that true independence and freedom of action on the part of each juror which is necessary to a fair trial of the accused.’ ” <em>Id., </em>at 150. This Court affirmed, holding that the judge was justified in concluding that the publication of the letter had made it impossible for the jury “to act with the independence and freedom on the part of each juror requisite to a fair trial of the issue between the parties.” <em>Id., </em>at 155.</p>
<p id="b684-5">In <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>155 U. S. 271, 279, the Court concluded that a mistrial was required when it was revealed that one of the trial jurors had served on the grand jury that indicted the defendant. Since it is possible that the grand jury had heard no more evidence — and perhaps even less— than was presented at the trial, and since the juror in question may have had no actual bias against the defendant, the record did not demonstrate that the mistrial was strictly “necessary.” There can be no doubt, however, about the validity of the conclusion that the possibility of bias justified the mistrial.</p>
<p id="b684-6">An improper opening statement unquestionably tends to frustrate the public interest in having a just judgment reached by an impartial tribunal. Indeed, such statements create a risk, often not present in the individual juror bias situation,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> that the entire panel may be tainted. The trial judge, of <page-number citation-index="1" label="513">*513</page-number>course, may instruct the jury to disregard the improper comment. In extreme cases, he may discipline counsel, or even remove him from the trial as he did in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U. S. 600. Those actions, however, will not necessarily remove the risk of bias that may be created by improper argument. Unless unscrupulous defense counsel are to be allowed an unfair advantage, the trial judge must have the power to declare a mistrial in appropriate cases. The interest in orderly, impartial procedure would be impaired if he were deterred from exercising that power by a concern that any time a reviewing court disagreed with his assessment of the trial situation a retrial would automatically be barred. The adoption of a stringent standard of appellate review in this area, therefore, would seriously impede the trial judge in the proper performance of his “duty, in order to protect the integrity of the trial, to take prompt and affirmative action to stop . . . professional misconduct.” <em>Id., </em>at 612.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b685-5">There are compelling institutional considerations militating in favor of appellate deference to the trial judge’s evaluation of the significance of possible juror bias.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> He has seen and <page-number citation-index="1" label="514">*514</page-number>heard the jurors during their <em>voir dire </em>examination. He is the judge most familiar with the evidence and the background of the case on trial. He has listened to the tone of the argument as it was delivered and has observed the apparent reaction of the jurors. In short, he is far more “conversant with the factors relevant to the determination” than any reviewing court can possibly be. See <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>336 U. S. 684, 687.</p>
<p id="b686-5">Ill</p>
<p id="b686-6">Our conclusion that a trial judge’s decision to declare a mistrial based on his assessment of the prejudicial impact of improper argument is entitled to great deference does not, of course, end the inquiry. As noted earlier, a constitutionally protected interest is inevitably affected by any mistrial decision. The trial judge, therefore, “must always temper the decision whether or not to abort the trial by considering the importance to the defendant of being able, once and for all, to conclude his confrontation with society through the verdict of a tribunal he might believe to be favorably disposed to his fate.” <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, </em>400 U. S., at 486 (Harlan, J.). In order to ensure that this interest is adequately protected, reviewing courts have an obligation to satisfy themselves that, in the words of Mr. Justice Story, the trial judge exercised “sound discretion” in declaring a mistrial.</p>
<p id="b686-7">Thus, if a trial judge acts irrationally or irresponsibly, cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, supra; </em>see <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>410 U. S., at 469, his action cannot be condoned. But our review of this record indicates that this was not such a case.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Defense <page-number citation-index="1" label="515">*515</page-number>counsel aired improper and highly prejudicial evidence before the jury, the possible impact of which the trial judge was in the best position to assess. The trial judge did not act precipitately in response to the prosecutor's request for a mistrial. On the contrary, evincing a concern for the possible double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous ruling, he gave both defense counsel and the prosecutor full opportunity to explain <page-number citation-index="1" label="516">*516</page-number>their positions on the propriety of a mistrial. We are therefore persuaded by the record that the trial judge acted responsibly and deliberately, and accorded careful consideration to respondent’s interest in having the trial concluded in a single proceeding. Since he exercised “sound discretion” in handling the sensitive problem of possible juror bias created by the improper comment of defense counsel, the mistrial order is supported by the “high degree” of necessity which is required in a case of this kind.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Neither party has a right to have his case decided by a jury which may be tainted by bias; <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> in these circumstances, “the public’s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgements” <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> must prevail over the defendant’s “valued right” to have his trial concluded before the first jury impaneled.</p>
<p id="b688-5">IY</p>
<p id="b688-6">One final matter requires consideration. The absence of an explicit finding of “manifest necessity” appears to have been determinative for the District Court and may have been so for the Court of Appeals. If those courts regarded that omission as critical,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> they required too much. Since the record provides <page-number citation-index="1" label="517">*517</page-number>sufficient justification for the state-court ruling, the failure to explain that ruling more completely does not render it constitutionally defective.</p>
<p id="b689-5">Review of any trial court decision is, of course, facilitated by findings and by an explanation of the reasons supporting the decision. No matter how desirable such procedural assistance may be, it is not constitutionally mandated in a case such as this. Cf. <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Naughten, </em>414 U. S. 141, 146. The basis for the trial judge’s mistrial order is adequately disclosed by the record, which includes the extensive argument of counsel prior to the judge’s ruling. The state trial judge’s mistrial declaration is not subject to collateral attack in a federal court simply because he failed to find “manifest necessity” in those words or to articulate on the record all the factors which informed the deliberate exercise of his discretion.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>

<p id="b674-9">The importance of the absence of express findings or reasons to the decision below seems apparent.

<p id="b676-9">"[T]he Government witnesses came to drop from their testimony impressions favorable to defendant. Thus a key prosecution witness, the last person to see appellant and the deceased together, who began by testifying that they had acted that evening like newlyweds on a honeymoon, without an unfriendly word spoken, ended up by saying for the first time in four trials that the words between them had been ‘firm,’ and possibly harsh and ‘cross.’</p>
<p id="b676-10">“We also' note that the police officer who readily acquiesced in the two ‘hung jury’ trials that appellant was ‘hysterical,’ later withheld that characterization. This shift, though less dramatic, was by no means inconsequential in view of the significance of appellant’s condition at the time he made a statement inconsistent with what he later told another officer.”</p>

<p id="b678-9"> The English courts have long recognized the truth of this proposition in the “hung jury” context:</p>
<p id="b678-10">“This rule if taken literally seems to command the confinement of the jury till death if they do not agree, and to avoid any such consequence an <page-number citation-index="1" label="507">*507</page-number>exception was introduced in practice which Blackstone has described by the words 'except in case of evident necessity.'</p>
<p id="b679-6">“But the exception so expressed has given rise to further doubts, because necessity is an equivocal word, meaning either irresistible compulsion or a high degree of need. Those who have been interested in objecting to a discharge of a jury before verdict, have disputed whether the discharge was necessary in the stricter sense of the word. The same dispute about the meaning of the word necessity in the exception to this rule is the source of the main questions raised upon this writ of error, and they are in substance answered when we decide on the meaning of that word in the exception to this rule, and apply that meaning to the facts appearing on this record. We assume it to be clear that the discharge of the jury before verdict may be lawful at some time and under some circumstances. Then with reference to the facts on this record, we hold that the judge at the first trial had by law power to discharge the jury before verdict, when a high degree of need for such discharge was made evident to his mind from the facts which he had ascertained. We cannot define the degree of need without some standard for comparison; we cannot approach nearer to precision than by describing the degree as a high degree such as in the wider sense of the word might be denoted by necessity.” <em>Winsor </em>v. <em>The Queen, supra, </em>at 390, 394.</p>

It should be noted, however, that the rationale for this deference in the “hung” jury situation is that the trial court is in the best position to assess all the factors which must be considered in making a necessarily discretionary determination whether the jury will be able to reach a just verdict if it continues to deliberate. If the record reveals that the trial judge has failed to exercise the “sound discretion” entrusted to him, the reason for such deference by an appellate court disappears. Thus, if the trial judge acts for reasons completely unrelated to the trial problem which purports to be the basis for the mistrial ruling, close appellate scrutiny is appropriate.

This case, however, simply stands for the well-accepted proposition that a witness may be impeached with evidence tending to show that he has an interest in giving testimony favorable to the State and against the defendant.

<p id="b685-6"> In his concurring opinion in <em>Dinitz, </em>Mr. Chief Justice Burger emphasized the narrow purpose and scope of a legitimate opening statement:</p>
<p id="b685-7">“It is to state what evidence will be presented, to make it easier for the jurors to understand what is to follow, and to relate parts of the evidence and testimony to the whole; it is not an occasion for argument. To make statements which will not or cannot be supported by proof is, if it relates to significant elements of the case, professional misconduct. Moreover, it is fundamentally unfair to an opposing party to allow an attorney, with the standing and prestige inherent in being an officer of the court, to present to the jury statements not susceptible of proof but intended to influence the jury in reaching a verdict.” 424 U.

<p id="b685-8">Our identification of this reason for according deference to the trial judge in juror bias cases generally is not intended as a comment upon the conduct of defense counsel in this case.</p>

<footnote label="33">
<p id="b685-9"> These considerations must be at least as weighty where a federal court, in considering a state prisoner’s collateral challenge to his conviction on <page-number citation-index="1" label="514">*514</page-number>the ground that it violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, reviews the determination of a state trial judge as to juror bias.</p>
</footnote>
<footnote label="34">
<p id="b686-9"> In this case, defense counsel made brief reference during <em>voir dire </em>to the fact that evidence was withheld from the defense at the previous trial. Later in the <em>voir dire </em>the prosecutor expressed his concern to the trial judge that if the jurors were aware of the fact that respondent obtained a new trial because the prosecution failed to produce some evidence, they might be prejudiced against the State. In response to the <page-number citation-index="1" label="515">*515</page-number>prosecutor’s concern, the trial judge conducted an inquiry into whether the jurors knew the reason for the new trial. The inquiry revealed that the jurors were not then aware of the reason for the new trial. During the opening statements which followed, however, defense counsel did not leave the matter to the jurors’ conjecture; instead, he explicitly stated that they would hear testimony showing that the Supreme Court of Arizona granted respondent a new trial because the prosecutor deliberately withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense. Following completion of opening argument, the prosecutor moved for a mistrial.</p>
<p id="b687-6">During argument on the prosecutor’s motion, defense counsel insisted that evidence of prosecutorial misconduct in a prior proceeding was admissible for impeachment purposes; although he could offer no authority to support this novel proposition, he indicated to the judge that he would appreciate an opportunity to “find . . . some written law, which would allow this type of testimony ... as evidence.” <em>Supra, </em>at 500 n. 3. While the trial judge remarked that he could conceive of no basis for the admission of such evidence and that he was tempted to grant the prosecutor’s request immediately because of defense counsel’s injection of the prosecutorial misconduct issue into the trial, <em>supra, </em>at 499-500, n. 3, he did not act precipitately. Rather, proceeding with caution and giving defense counsel the benefit of the doubt, App. 223, the trial judge reserved ruling on the admissibility question and at first denied the mistrial motion. In avoiding a hasty decision despite his conviction that the evidence was improper, the trial judge was plainly acting out of concern for the double jeopardy interests implicated by an improvident mistrial. <em>Id,., </em>at 225, 253.</p>
<p id="b687-7">The following day the prosecutor renewed his motion. The trial judge heard extensive argument from both sides regarding both the propriety of defense counsel’s opening statement and the need for a mistrial. Defense counsel contended that any prejudice which might have resulted from the references to prosecutorial misconduct could be cured by cautionary instructions; the prosecutor argued that such an alternative would be inadequate to remove the risk of taint.</p>

<p id="b688-7"> Two considerations, while not determinative, add support to this conclusion. First, crowded calendars throughout the Nation impose a constant pressure on our judges to finish the business at hand. Generally, they have an interest in having the trial completed as promptly as possible, an interest which frequently parallels the constitutionally protected interest of the accused in having the trial concluded by a particular tribunal. Second, respondent does not attempt to demonstrate specific prejudice from the mistrial ruling, other than the harm which always accompanies retrial.

<p id="b689-11"> The Court of Appeals was concerned that the trial judge may have granted the State’s mistrial motion because the comments of defense counsel were improper without considering the possible impact of those comments on the impartiality of the jurors. We think this concern was unwarranted. Shortly after defense counsel made his first, brief reference to the withholding of evidence in the earlier trial, the judge indicated his concern regarding the possible “poisoning of the panel.” In addition, both sides argued the question of juror bias and offered their views on whether action short of a mistrial would suffice to eliminate the risk of taint. Finally, the trial judge indicated his awareness of the grave consequences of an erroneous mistrial ruling. We are unwilling to assume that a judge, who otherwise acted responsibly and deliberately, simply neglected to consider one of the central issues presented by the mistrial motion and argued by the parties when he made his ruling.</p>
