**Lead Opinion**
 The holding of United States v. California , as opposed to the language quoted in the text, is quite consistent with our holding today.  There California's activity to which the congressional command was directed was not in an area that the States have regarded as integral parts of their governmental activities.  It was, on the contrary, the operation of a railroad engaged in "common carriage by rail in interstate commerce .  .  .  .” 297 U. S., at 182 .  For the same reasons, despite Mr. Justice Brennan’s claims to the contrary, the holdings in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964), and California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), are likewise unimpaired by our decision today.  It also seems appropriate to note that Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92 (1946), has not been overruled as the dissent asserts.  Indeed that decision, *855 upon which our Brother heavily relies, has no direct application to the questions we consider today at all. For there the Court sustained an application of the Emergency Price Control Act to a sale of timber by the State of Washington, expressly noting that the “only question is whether the State’s power to make the sales must be in subordination to the power of Congress to fix maximum prices in order to carry on war.” Id., at 102 .  The Court rejected the State’s claim of immunity on the ground that sustaining it would impermissibly “impair a prime purpose of the Federal Government’s establishment.” Ibid. Nothing we say in this opinion addresses the scope of Congress’ authority under its war power.  Cf. n. 17, supra. MR. Justice Brennan’s dissent leaves no doubt from its discussion, post, at 876-878, that in its view Congress may under its commerce power deal with the States as States just as they might deal with private individuals.  We venture to say that it is this conclusion, rather than the one we reach, which is in the words of the dissent a “startling restructuring of our federal system .  .
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Blackmun, concurring. The Court’s opinion and the dissents indicate the importance and significance of this litigation as it bears upon the relationship between the Federal Government and our States. Although I am not untroubled by certain possible implications of the Court’s opinion — some of them suggested by the dissents — I do not read the opinion so despairingly as does my Brother Brennan. In my view, the result with respect to the statute under challenge here is necessarily correct. I may misinterpret the Court’s opinion, but it seems to me that it adopts a balancing approach, and does not outlaw federal power in areas such as environmental protection, where the federal interest is demonstrably greater and where state facility compliance with imposed federal standards would be essential. See ante, at 852-853. With this understanding on my part of the Court’s opinion, I join it.

 They are the restraints on which the people must often rely solely, in all representative governments.” Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 197 (1824) (emphasis added).  1 Only 34 years ago, Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 120 (1942), reaffirmed that “[a]t the beginning Chief Justice Marshall .  .  .  made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature of [Congress’ commerce] power by *858 warning that effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes.” My Brethren do not successfully obscure today’s patent usurpation of the role reserved for the political process by their purported discovery in the Constitution of a restraint derived from sovereignty of the States on Congress’ exercise of the commerce power.  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall recognized that limitations “prescribed in the constitution,” Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, at 196 , restrain Congress’ exercise of the power.  See Parden v. Terminal R. Co., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184, 191</citedDecision> (1964); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 305 (1964); United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 114 (1941).  Thus laws within the commerce power may not infringe individual liberties protected by the First Amendment, Mabee v. White Plains Publishing Co., 327 U. S. 178 (1946); the Fifth Amendment, Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6 (1969); or the Sixth Amendment, United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570 (1968).  But there is no restraint based on state sovereignty requiring or permitting judicial enforcement anywhere expressed in the Constitution; our decisions over the last century and a half have explicitly rejected the existence of any such restraint on the commerce power.  2 *859 We said in United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175, 184 (1936), for example: “The sovereign power of the states is necessarily diminished to the extent of the grants of power to the federal government in the Constitution.  .  .  .

 See, e. g., Mulford v. Smith, supra, at 51 (Butler, J., dissenting); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, at 76 (McReynolds, J., dissenting) .  9 *869 That no precedent justifies today's result is particularly clear from the awkward extension of the doctrine of state immunity from federal taxation — an immunity conclusively distinguished by Mr. Justice Stone in California , and an immunity that is “narrowly limited” because “the people of all the states have created the national government and are represented in Congress,” Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 416 (1938) (Stone, J.) 10 — to fashion a judicially enforceable restraint on *870 Congress’ exercise of the commerce power that the Court has time and again rejected as having no place in our constitutional jurisprudence.  11 “[W]here [Congress] *871 keeps within its sphere and violates no express constitutional limitation it has been the rule of this Court, going back almost to the founding days of the Republic, not to interfere.” Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S., at 305 .  To argue, as do my Brethren, that the 1974 amendments are directed at the “States qua States,” and “dis-plací] state policies regarding the manner in which they will structure delivery of those governmental services which their citizens require,” ante, at 847, and therefore “directly penaliz[e] the States for choosing to hire governmental employees on terms different from those which Congress has sought to impose,” ante, at 849, is only to advance precisely the unsuccessful arguments made by the State of Washington in Case v. Bowles and the State of California in United States v. California .  The 1974 amendments are, however, an entirely legitimate exercise of the commerce power, not in the slightest restrained by any doctrine of state sovereignty cognizable in this Court, as Case v. Bowles, United States v. California, Maryland v. Wirtz , and our other pertinent precedents squarely and definitively establish.  Moreover, since Maryland v. Wirtz is overruled, the Fair Labor Standards Act is invalidated in its application to all state employees “in [any areas] that the States have regarded as integral parts of their governmental activities.” Ante, at 854 n. 18.  This standard is a meaningless limitation on the Court’s state-sovereignty doctrine, and thus today’s holding goes beyond even what the States of Washington and California urged in Case v. Bowles and United States v. California , and by its logic would overrule those cases and with them Parden v. Terminal R. Co., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964), and certain reasoning in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S. 279, 284-285 (1973).  I cannot recall another instance in the Court’s history when the reasoning of so many decisions covering so long a span of time has been *872 discarded in such a roughshod manner.  That this is done without any justification not already often advanced and consistently rejected, clearly renders today’s decision an ipse dixit reflecting nothing but displeasure with a congressional judgment.  My Brethren’s treatment of Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), further illustrates the paucity of legal reasoning or principle j ustifying today’s result.  Although the Economic Stabilization Act “displace[d] the States’ freedom,” ante, at 852 — the reason given for invalidating the 1974 amendments — the result in Fry is not disturbed since the interference was temporary and only a national program enforced by the Federal Government could have alleviated the country’s economic crisis.  Thus, although my Brethren by fiat strike down the 1974 amendments without analysis of countervailing national considerations, Fry by contrary logic remains undisturbed because, on balance, countervailing national considerations override the interference with the State’s freedom.  Moreover, it is sophistry to say the Economic Stabilization Act “displaced no state choices,” ante, at 853, but that the 1974 amendments do, ante, at 848.

 See Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, *870 269 U. S. 514 [1926]; cf. Thomson v. Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall. 579, 588, 590 [1870], With the steady expansion of the activity of state governments into new fields they have undertaken the performance of functions not known to the states when the Constitution was adopted, and have taken over the management of business enterprises once conducted exclusively by private individuals subject to the national taxing power.  In a complex economic society tax burdens laid upon those who directly or indirectly have dealings with the states, tend, to some extent not capable of precise measurement, to be passed on economically and thus to burden the state government itself.  But if every federal tax which is laid on some new form of state activity, or whose economic burden reaches in some measure the state or those who serve it, were to be set aside as an infringement of state sovereignty, it is evident that a restriction upon national power, devised only as a shield to protect the states from curtailment of the essential operations of government which they have exercised from the beginning, would become a ready means for striking down the taxing power of the nation.  See South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 454-455 [1905].  Once impaired by the recognition of a state immunity found to be excessive, restoration of that power is not likely to be secured through the action of state legislatures; for they are without the inducements to act which have often persuaded Congress to waive immunities thought to be excessive.” Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S., at 416-417 (footnote omitted).  My Brethren also ignore our holdings that the principle of state sovereignty held to be embodied in the Eleventh Amendment can be overridden by Congress under the Commerce Clause.  Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976); Farden v. Terminal R. Co., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964).  Although the Eleventh Amendment can be overcome by exercise of the power to regulate commerce, my Brethren never explain why the protections of state sovereignty they erroneously find embodied in the Tenth Amendment cannot similarly be overcome.  Instead, they merely tell us which delegated powers are limited by state sovereignty, ante, at 843-844, n. 14, and which are not, ante, at 854-855, n. 18, see also Kleppe v. New Mexico, ante, p. 529, but neither reason nor precedent distinguishing among these powers is provided.  My Brethren’s reluctance to rely on the cost of compliance to invalidate this legislation is advisable.  “Such matters raise not constitutional issues but questions of policy.  They relate to the wisdom, need, and effectiveness of a particular project.  They are therefore questions for the Congress, not the courts.” Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Atkinson Co., 313 U. S., at 527 .

 Fry only last Term emphasized "that States are not immune from all federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status.  " 421 U. S., at 548 (emphasis added).  For "[b]y empowering Congress to regulate commerce.  .  .  the States necessarily surrendered any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regulation." <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> v. Terminal R. Co., supra, at 192; see Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., supra, at 286.  Employment relations of States that subject themselves to congressional regulation by participating in regulable commerce are subject to congressional regulation.  California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553, 568 (1957).  Plainly it has gotten no earlier since we declared it "too late in the day to question the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause to regulate .  .  .  activities and instrumentalities [in interstate commerce].
