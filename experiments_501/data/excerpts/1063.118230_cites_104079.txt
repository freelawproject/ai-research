**Lead Opinion**
 Today’s holding conforms our eommonsense practice to the statutory scheme, making it unnecessary to invoke our extraordinary jurisdiction in routine eases, which present important and meritorious claims.  The United States does not dispute that Hohn’s claim has considerable merit and acknowledges that the trial court committed an error of constitutional magnitude.  The only contested issue is whether the constitutional violation was a substantial one.  Brief in Opposition 7-8.  Were we to adopt the position advanced by the dissent, the only way we could consider his meritorious claim would be through the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. *251 § 1651 (a).  Our rule permits us to carry out our normal function of reviewing possible misapplications of law by the courts of appeals without having to resort to extraordinary remedies.  Our decision, we must acknowledge, is in direct conflict with the portion of our decision in House v. Mayo, <citedDecision>324 U. S. 42, 44</citedDecision> (1945) (per curiam), holding that we lack statutory certiorari jurisdiction to review refusals to issue certificates of probable cause.  Given the number and frequency of the cases, and the difficulty of reconciling our practice with a requirement that only an extraordinary writ can be used to address them, we do not think stare decisis concerns require us to adhere to that decision.  Its conclusion was erroneous, and it should not be followed.  Stare decisis is “the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).  “Considerations of stare decisis have special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done.” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989).  We have recognized, however, that stare decisis is a “principle of policy” rather than “an inexorable command.” Payne, supra, at 828 .  For example, we have felt less constrained to follow precedent where, as here, the opinion was rendered without full briefing or argument.  Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U. S. 648, 651, n. 1 (1987) (questioning the prece-dential value of Davis v. Georgia, 429 U. S. 122 (1976) (per curiam)).  The role of stare decisis, furthermore, is “somewhat reduced ... in the case of a procedural rule ... which does not serve as a guide to lawful behavior.” United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995) (citing Payne, supra, at *252 828 ).  Here we have a rule of procedure that does not alter primary conduct.  And what is more, the rule of procedure announced in <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Mayo</citedDecision> has often been disregarded in our own practice.  Both Hohn and the United States cite numerous instances in which we have granted writs of certiorari to review denials of certificate applications without requiring the petitioner to move for leave to file for an extraordinary writ, as previously required by our rules, and without requiring any extraordinary showing or exhibiting any doubts about our jurisdiction to do so. 17 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §4036, pp. 15-16 (2d ed. 1988) (collecting cases).  Included among these examples are several noteworthy decisions which resolved significant issues of federal law. See, e. g., Allen v. Hardy, 478 U. S. 255, 257-258 (1986) (per curiam) (refusing to permit retroactive application of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), on collateral attack); Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U. S. 433, 436 (1997) (holding the cancellation of early release credits violated the Ex Post Facto Clause).  These deviations have led litigants and the legal community to question the vitality of the rule announced in <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Mayo</citedDecision> .  As commentators have observed: “More recent cases .  .  .  have regularly granted certiorari following denial of leave to proceed in forma pauperis, or refusal to certify probable cause, without any indication that review was by common law writ rather than statutory certiorari.  At least as to these two questions, statutory certiorari should be available.” Wright, Miller, & Cooper, supra, at 15-16 (footnotes omitted).  Our frequent disregard for the rule announced in <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Mayo</citedDecision> weakens the suggestion that Congress could have placed significant reliance on it, especially in light of the commentary on our practice in the legal literature.  This is not to say opinions passing on jurisdictional issues sub silentio may be said to have overruled an opinion addressing the issue directly.  See, e. g., United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805) (Marshall, C. J.).  Our decisions re *253 main binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about' their continuing vitality.  Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).  Once we have decided to reconsider a particular rule, however, we would be remiss if we did not consider the consistency with which it has been applied in practice.  Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965); see also Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962).  This consideration, when combined with our analysis of the legal issue in question, convinces us the contrary holding of <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Mayo</citedDecision> cannot stand.  We hold this Court has jurisdiction under § 1254(1) to review denials of applications for certificates of appealability by a circuit judge or a panel of a court of appeals.  The portion of <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Mayo</citedDecision> holding this Court lacks statutory cer-tiorari jurisdiction over denials of certificates of probable cause is overruled.  In light of the position asserted by the Solicitor General nr the brief for the United States filed August 18, 1997, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further consideration consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice Souter, concurring.  I would be content to decide this ease on the authority of House v. Mayo, <citedDecision>324 U. S. 42</citedDecision> (1945) (per curiam), that common-law certiorari is available to review the denial of the certificate, leaving House’s precarious future for another day when its precedential value might have to be faced squarely.  But that course would command no more than a minority of one, and there is good reason to deny it even that support.  House’s holding on what may be “ fin’ the court of appeals,” <citedDecision>id., at 44</citedDecision> , was virtually unreasoned, and the Court correctly notes our subsequent practice of honoring this rule in the breach.  Given the weakness of the precedent, the *254 advantage of having a clear majority for a rule governing our jurisdiction to reverse erroneous denials of certificates of appealability persuades me to join the others in overruling <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> insofar as it would bear on issuance of a statutory writ of certiorari under 28 U. S. C. § 1254 (1).
**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.  Today’s opinion permits review where Congress, with unmistakable clarity, has denied it.  To reach this result, the Court ignores the obvious intent of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, distorts the meaning of our own jurisdictional statute, 28 U. S. C. § 1254 (1), and overrules a 53-year-old precedent, House v. Mayo, <citedDecision>324 U. S. 42</citedDecision> (1945) (per curiam).  I respectfully dissent.  I This Court’s jurisdiction under 28 TJ. S. C. § 1254(1) is limited to “[cjases in the courts of appeals.” Section 102 of AEDPA provides that “[ujnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from .  .  .  the final order in a habeas eorpus proceeding under section 2255,” that is, a district court habeas proceeding challenging federal custody.  Petitioner, who is challenging federal custody under 28 U. S. C. §2255 , did not obtain a certificate of appealability (COA).  By the plain language of AEDPA, his appeal “from” the district court’s “final order” “may not be taken to the court of appeals.” Because it could not be taken to the Court of Appeals, it quite obviously was never in the Court of Appeals; and because it was never in the Court of Appeals, we lack jurisdiction under § 1254(1) to entertain it.  We have already squarely and explicitly endorsed this straightforward interpretation.  In <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> v. Mayo, <citedDecision>324 U. S., at 44</citedDecision> , involving the predecessors to §§1254(1) and *255 2253(c)(1), the statutorily required certificate was called a “certificate of probable cause” rather than a certificate of ap-pealability, but the effect of failure to obtain it was precisely the same: The ease could not proceed to the court of appeals.  On an attempt to obtain review of denial of the certificate in this Court, we held that since petitioner’s “case was never 'in’ the court of appeals, for want of a certificate,” we lacked jurisdiction under § 1254(1).  Ibid. The Court concedes that <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> is squarely on point but opts to overrule it because its “conclusion was erroneous,” ante, at 251.  The Court does not dispute that petitioner’s §2255 action was never in the Court of Appeals; its overruling of <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> is instead based on the proposition that petitioner’s request for a COA is, in and of itself, a “ease” within the meaning of § 1254(1), see ante, at 241-242, 246-249, and that that case was “in” the Court of Appeals and hence can be reviewed here, ante, at 241-246.  Most of the Court’s analysis is expended in the effort to establish that petitioner made his request for a COA to the Court of Appeals as such, rather than to the circuit judges in their individual capacity, ibid. Even that effort is unsuccessful, since it comes up against the pellucid language of AEDPA to the contrary.  Section 102 does not permit application for a COA to a court of appeals; it states that the application must be made to a “circuit justice or judge.” That this means precisely what it says is underscored by § 103 of AEDPA, which amends Rule 22 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure: “If [a COA] request is addressed to the eourt of appeals, it shall be deemed addressed to the judges thereof and shall be considered by a circuit judge or judges as the eourt deems appropriate.” As though drafted in anticipatory refutation of the Court’s eountertextual holding today, the Advisory Committee’s Notes on Rule 22 explicitly state that “28 U. S. C. §2253 does not authorize the court of appeals as a eourt to grant a certificate of probable cause.” 28 U. S. C. App., p. 609.  *256 Proclaiming the request for a COA to be "in” the Court of Appeals is the most obvious of the Court’s statutory distortions, but not the one with the most serious collateral consequences.  The latter award goes to the Court’s virtually un-analyzed pronouncement (also essential to its holding) that the request for a COA was itself a "case” within the meaning of § 1254(1).  The notion that a request pertaining to a case constitutes its own "case” for purposes of § 1254 is a jaw-dropper.  To support that remarkable assertion, the Court relies upon circumstantial evidence — that the "application moved through the Eighth Circuit in the same manner as cases in general do.” Ante, at 242.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Quirin held that a petition for habeas corpus constituted the institution of a suit, and that it was not necessary for the writ to issue for the matter to be considered a case or controversy.  317 U. S., at 24 .  Quirin relied upon our decision in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 , 110-113 (1866), which reasoned that a petition for habeas corpus is a suit because the petitioner seeks “That remedy which the law affords him’” to recover his liberty.  Id., at 113 (quoting Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 464 (1829)).  Petitioner’s request for §2255 relief is analogous to a petition for habeas corpus, but his request for a COA is of a wholly different nature.  That is no “remedy” for any harm, but a threshold procedural requirement that petitioner must meet in order to carry his §2255 suit to the appellate stage.  That is why the Court in <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> , decided less than three years after Quirin, did not treat the application for a certificate as a separate case but did recognize the petition for habeas corpus as a ease even though it was decided without a hearing or a call for a return.  <citedDecision>324 U. S., at 43</citedDecision> .  I have described above why <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> was entirely correct, but a few words are in order concerning the inappropriate *259 ness of overruling <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> , regardless of its virtue as an original matter.  “[T]he "burden borne by the party advocating abandonment of an established precedent is greater where the Court is asked to overrule a point of statutory construction.” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989); see also Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  The Court acknowledges this principle, but invokes cases of ours that say that stare decisis concerns are “ ‘somewhat reduced’ ” in the ease of a procedural rule.  Ante, at 251.  The basis for that principle, of course, is that procedural rules do not ordinarily engender detrimental reliance — and in this ease, as I shall discuss, detrimental reliance by the Congress of the United States is self-evident.  In any event, even those cases cited by the Court as applying the “somewhat reduced” standard to procedural holdings still felt the need to set forth special factors justifying the overruling.  United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995), concluded that “the decision in question had been proved manifestly erroneous, and its underpinnings eroded, by subsequent decisions of this Court”; and Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828-830 (1991), noted that the overruled cases had been “decided by the narrowest of margins, over spirited dissents challenging [their] basic underpinnings,” had been “questioned by Members of the Court in later decisions,” and had “defied consistent application by the lower courts.” The Court’s next excuse is that <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> was decided without full briefing or argument.  The sole precedent it cites for the proposition that this makes a difference is Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U. S. 648, 651, n. 1 (1987).  Gray , however, did not deny stare decisis effect to an opinion rendered without full briefing and argument — it accorded stare decisis effect.  Id., at 666-667 .  What the Court relies upon is the mere dictum, rendered in the course of this opinion (and dictum in a footnote, at that), that “summary action here does not have the *260 same precedential effect as does a case decided upon Ml briefing and argument.” Id., at 651, n. 1 .  But tbe sole authority cited for that dictum was Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974), which declined to give stare decisis effect, not to opinions that had been issued without briefing and argument, but to judgments that had been issued without opinion — “summary affirmances” that did not “contain any substantive discussion” of the point at issue or any other point, id., at 670-671 .  Such judgments, affirming without comment the disposition appealed from, were common in the days when this Court had an extensive mandatory jurisdiction; they carried little more weight than denials of certio-rari.  <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> , by contrast, was a six-page opinion with substantive discussion on the point at issue here.  It reasoned: (1) “Our authority... extends only to cases In a circuit court of appeals ....’” (2) “Here the case was never fin’ the court of appeals,” because of (3) “want of a certificate of probable cause.” <citedDecision>324 U. S., at 44</citedDecision> .  2 And it cited as authority Ferguson v. District of Columbia, 270 U. S. 633 (1926).  The new rule that the Court today announces — that our opinions rendered without Ml briefing and argument (hitherto thought to be the strongest indication of certainty in the outcome) have a diminished stare decisis effect — may well turn out to be the principal point for which the present opinion will be remembered.  It can be expected to affect the treatment of many significant per curiam opinions by the lower courts, and the willingness of Justices to undertake summary disposition in the future.  *261 Of course even if one accepts that the two factors the Court alludes to (procedural ruling plus absence of full briefing or argument) reduce House’s stare decisis effect, one must still acknowledge that its stare decisis effect is increased by the fact that it was a statutory holding.  The Court does not contend that stare decisis is utterly inapplicable, and so it must come up with some reason for ignoring it.  Its reason is that we have “disregarded” <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> in practice.  Ante, at 252.  The opinions it cites for this proposition, however, not only fail to mention <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> ; they fail to mention the jurisdictional issue to which <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> pertains.  And “we have repeatedly held that the existence of unaddressed jurisdictional defects has no precedential effect.” Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 352, n. 2 (1996) (emphasis added).  Surely it constitutes “precedential effect” to reduce the stare decisis effect of one of the Court’s holdings.  It is significant, moreover, that when Members of the Court have discussed <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> or the jurisdictional effect of a COA denial, they have agreed that jurisdiction is not available under § 1254.  See Davis v. Jacobs, 454 U. S. 911, 912 (1981) (Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari); id., at 916-917 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Powell, J., dissenting); Jeffries v. Barksdale, 453 U. S. 914 , 915-916 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Powell, J., dissenting).  The Court’s new approach to unaddressed jurisdictional defects is perhaps the second point for which the present opinion will be remembered.  While there is scant reason for denying stare decisis effect to <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> , there is special reason for according it: the reliance of Congress upon an unrepudiated decision central to the procedural scheme it was creating.  Section 102 of AEDPA continues a long tradition of provisions enacted by Congress that limit appellate review of petitions.  In 1908, Congress required a certificate of probable cause in habeas corpus eases involving state prisoners before an appeal would lie to *262 this Court, see Act of Mar. 10, 1908, ch. 76, 35 Stat. 40 .  In 1925, this requirement was extended to intermediate appellate proceedings, see Act of Feb. 18,1925, ch. 229, §§ 6(d), 13, 43 Stat. 940 , 942.  Before 1925, this Court readily concluded it had no jurisdiction over appeals brought before it in the absence of a certificate, see, e. g., Bilik v. Strassheim, 212 U. S. 551 (1908); Ex parte Patrick, 212 U. S. 555 (1908), and <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> interpreted the 1925 amendment to produce the same effect in the courts of appeals and, consequently, in this Court under the predecessor to § 1254(1).  Quite obviously, with <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> on the books — neither overruled nor even cited in the later opinions that the Court claims “disregarded” it— Congress presumably anticipated that §102 of AEDPA would be interpreted in the same manner.  3 In yet another striking departure from our ordinary practice, the Court qualifies the rule that statutes are deemed to adopt the extant holdings of this Court, see Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 212 (1993): They will not be deemed to adopt them, the Court says, when legal commentators “question *263 the vitality” of the holdings.  Ante, at 252.  The confusion that will be introduced by this new approach is obvious.  At bottom, the only justification for the Court’s holding— and the only one that prompts the concurrence to overrule <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> — is convenience: it “permits us to carry out our normal function” of appellate review.  Ante, at 251.  Our “normal” function of appellate review, however, is no more and no less than what Congress says it is.  U. S. Const., Art. Ill, § 2.  The Court’s defiance of the scheme created by Congress in evident reliance on our precedent is a display not of “common sense,” ante, at 250, but of judicial willfulness.  And a doctrine of stare decisis that is suspended when five Justices find it inconvenient (or indeed, as the concurrence suggests, even four Justices in search of a fifth) is no doctrine at all, but simply an excuse for adhering to cases we like and abandoning those we do not.  II Since I find no jurisdiction under § 1254(1), I must address the Government’s further argument that we can issue a common-law writ of certiorari under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. § 1651 .  The All Writs Act provides that “[t]he Supreme Court... may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of [its] jurisdietio[n] and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” As expressly noted in this Court’s Rule 20.1, issuance of a writ under § 1651 “is not a matter of right, but of discretion sparingly exercised,” and “[t]o justify the granting of any such writ, the petition must show that the writ will be in aid of the Court’s appellate jurisdiction, that exceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of the Court’s discretionary powers, and that adequate relief cannot be obtained in any other form or from any other court.” Petitioner (who filed a petition for a writ of certiorari under § 1254(1), not under the All Writs Act, Pet. for Cert. 1) has failed to establish that he meets these requirements.  To begin with, he has not shown that adequate relief is unobtainable in any form or from any other court. AEDPA dif *264 fers from the gatekeeping statute at issue in <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> in a crucial respect: when <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> was decided, claimants could seek certificates of probable cause only from “the United States court by which the final decision was rendered or a judge of the circuit court of appeals,” 28 U. S. C. §466 (1940 ed.), whereas § 102 of AEDPA permits claimants to seek COA’s from a “circuit justice or judge.” Because petitioner may obtain the relief he seeks from a circuit justice, relief under the All Writs Act is not “necessary.” Relief under the Act is also not “appropriate.” The only circumstance alleged by petitioner to justify relief is that the Eighth Circuit erroneously concluded that he failed to present a substantial constitutional question.  There is nothing “exceptional” about this claim; it is in fact the same claim available to every petitioner when a COA is denied, and entertaining it would render application for this “extraordinary” writ utterly routine.  Issuance of the writ is not “appropriate” for another reason as well: It would frustrate the purpose of AEDPA, which is to prevent review unless a COA is granted.  ‘Where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.  Although that Act empowers federal courts to fashion extraordinary remedies when the need arises, it does not authorize them to issue ad hoe writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.” Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U. S. 34, 43 (1985).  4 * * * The purpose of AEDPA is not obscure.  It was to eliminate the interminable delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, and the shameful overloading of *265 our federal criminal justice system, produced by various aspects of this Court’s habeas corpus jurisprudence.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Its observation that a dispute over venue is not unreviewable simply because it is preliminary, ante, at 248-249, is accurate but irrelevant.  The issue is not whether a venue dispute may be reviewed at all, but whether it may be reviewed in isolation from some ease of which it is a part.  It may not, because a venue dispute, standing alone — like a request for a COA, standing alone — lacks the requisite qualities of a case. If the entire §2255 proceeding was not “in” the Court of Appeals, the COA request alone was not a “case” that § 1254 authorizes us to review.  The concurrence asserts that this analysis was “virtually unreasoned.” Ante, at 253 (opinion of Souter, J.).  It seems to me, to the contrary, that there was virtually nothing more to be said.  Not until today has anyone thought that a “ease” could consist of a disembodied request to appeal.  The concurrence joins the Court in relying upon a truly eccentric argument, and then blames the <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> Court for not discussing this eccentricity at length.  The Court points to the fact that another provision of AEDPA, which requires court of appeals authorization before a state prisoner can file a second or successive habeas petition in district court, specifically states that the denial of the authorization “shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition ... for a writ of certiorari.” 28 U. S. C. § 2244 (b)(3)(E) (1994 ed., Supp. II).  This provision, the Court says, would be rendered “superfluous” if we followed House, ante, at 249.  That is not so. Section 2244(b)(3) addresses whether there will be district-court consideration of a second or successive petition at all, not whether the district court’s consideration may be reviewed by an appellate court. Only the latter is covered by the holding of <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> .  It is true enough that the reasoning of <citedDecision>House</citedDecision> , if carried over to the other question, would produce the same result; but Congress’s specification of that result when there is no Supreme Court holding precisely in point would more accurately be described as cautious than superfluous.  Indeed, the greater relevance of § 2244(b)(3) to the question before us is this: It would be exceedingly strange to foreclose certiorari review of the denial of all federal intervention, as that provision does, while according certiorari review of the denial of appeal from the federal district court to the court of appeals.  Because petitioner has not demonstrated that issuance of the writ is “necessary” or “appropriate” under § 1651,1 need not discuss whether it fails the further requirement that it be “in aid of” our jurisdiction.
