 But as we emphasized in Kennedy itself, no one factor should be considered controlling as they “may often point in differing directions.” 372 U. S., at 169 .  The second significant departure in Halper .  was the Court’s decision to “asses[s] the character of the actual sanctions imposed,” 490 U. S., at 447 , rather than, as Kennedy demanded, evaluating the “statute on its face” to determine whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction, 372 U. S., at 169 .  We believe that Halper’s deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered.  5 AlS subsequent *102 eases have demonstrated, Hamper’s test for determining whether a particular sanction is “punitive,” and thus subject to the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause, has proved unworkable.  We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect.  See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14 (1994); United States v. Ursery, <citedDecision>518 U. S. 267, 284-285, n. 2</citedDecision> (1996).  6 If a sanction must be “solely” remedial (i.  e., entirely nonde-terrent) to avoid implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause, then no civil penalties are beyond the scope of the Clause.  Under Halper’s method of analysis, a court must also look at the “sanction actually imposed” to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated.  Thus, it will not be possible to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is violated until a defendant has proceeded through a trial to judgment.  But in those eases where the civil proceeding follows the criminal proceeding, this approach flies in the face of the notion that the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the government from even “attempting a second time to punish criminally.” Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399 (emphasis added).  Finally, it should be noted that some of the ills at which Halper was directed are addressed by other constitutional *103 provisions.

 Applying traditional double jeopardy principles to the facts of this ease, it is clear that the criminal prosecution of these petitioners would not.  violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  It is evident that Congress intended the OCC money penalties and debarment sanctions imposed for violations of 12 U. S. C. §§ 84 and 375b to be civil in nature.  As for the money penalties, both §§ 93(b)(1) and 504(a), which authorize the imposition of monetary penalties for violations of §§ 84 and 375b respectively, expressly provide that such penalties are “civil.” While the provision authorizing debarment contains no language explicitly denominating the sanction as civil, we think it significant that the authority to issue debarment orders is conferred upon the “appropriate Federal banking agencies].” §§ 1818(e)(1)-(3).  That such authority was conferred upon administrative agencies is prima facie evidence that Congress intended to provide for a civil sanction.  See Helvering, supra, at 402 ; United States v. Spector, 343 U. S. 169, 178 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (“Administrative determinations of liability to deportation have been sustained as constitutional only by considering them to be-exclusively civil in nature, with no criminal consequences or connotations”); Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 235 (1896) (holding that quintessential criminal punishments may be imposed only “by a judicial trial”).  *104 Turning to the second stage of the Ward test, we find-that there is little evidence, much less the clearest proof that we require, suggesting that either OCC money penalties or debarment sanctions are “so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal despite Congress’ intent to the contrary.” <citedDecision>Ursery, supra, at 290</citedDecision> .  First, neither money penalties nor debarment has historically been viewed as punishment.  We have long recognized that “revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted,” such as a debarment, “is characteristically free of the punitive criminal element.” Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399 , and n. 2.  Similarly, “the payment of fixed or variable sums of money [is a] sanction which ha[s] been recognized as enforeible by civil proceedings since the original revenue law of 1789.” Id., at 400 .  Second, the sanctions imposed not an tive disability or restraint,” as that term is normally understood.  While petitioners have been prohibited from further participating in the banking industry, this is “certainly nothing approaching the 'infamous punishment’ of imprisonment.” Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960).  Third, neither sanction comes into play “only” on a finding of scienter.

 “Good faith” is considered by OCC in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed, § 93(b)(2), but a penalty ean be imposed even in the absence of bad faith.  The fact that petitioners’ “good faith” was considered in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed in this case is irrelevant, as we look only'to “the statute on its face” to determine whether a penalty is criminal in nature.  Kennedy, 372 U. S., at 169 .  Similarly, while debarment may be imposed for a “willful” disregard “for the safety or soundness of [an] insured depository institution,” *105 willfulness is not a prerequisite to debarment; it is sufficient that the disregard for the safety and soundness of the institution was “continuing." § 1818(e)(1)(C)(ii).  Fourth, the conduct for which OCC sanctions are imposed may also be criminal (and in this ease formed the basis for petitioners’ indictments).  This fact is insufficient to render the money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, <citedDecision>518 U. S., at 292</citedDecision> , particularly in the double jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704 (1993) (rejecting “same-conduct” test for double jeopardy purposes).  Finally, we recognize that the imposition of both money penalties and debarment sanctions will deter others from emulating petitioners’ conduct, a traditional goal of criminal punishment.  But the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence “may serve civil as well as criminal goals.” <citedDecision>Ursery, supra, at 292</citedDecision> ; see also Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 452 (1996) (“[Forfeiture .  .  .  serves a deterrent purpose distinct from any punitive purpose”).  For example, the sanctions at issue here, while intended to deter future wrongdoing, also serve to promote the stability of the banking industry.  To hold that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions “criminal” for double jeopardy purposes would severely undermine the Government’s ability to engage in effective regulation of institutions sueh as banks.  In sum, there simply is very little showing, to say nothing of the “clearest proof ” required by Ward , that OCC money penalties and debarment sanctions are criminal.. The Double Jeopardy Clause is therefore no obstacle to their trial on the pending indictments, and it may proceed.

 But the question upon which we granted certiorari in this ease is “whether imposition upon petitioners of monetary-fines as in personam civil penalties by the Department of the Treasury, together with other sanctions, is ‘punishment’ for purposes of the Double *102 Jeopardy Clause.” Pet. for Cert. i.  It is this question, and not the Blockburger issue, upon which there is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in this case did not even pass upon the Bloekbwrger question, finding it unnecessary to do so. 92 F. 3d, at 1028, n. 3 .  In Kurth Ranch , we held that the presence a purpose effect is not dispositive of the double jeopardy question.  511 U. S., at 781 .  Rather, we applied a Kennedy-like test, see 511 U. S., at 780-783 , before concluding that Montana’s dangerous drug tax was “the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution,” id., at 784 .  Similarly, in <citedDecision>Ursery</citedDecision> , we rejected the notion that civil in rem forfeitures violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  <citedDecision>518 U. S., at 270-271</citedDecision> .  We upheld such forfeitures, relying on the historical support for the notion that such forfeitures are civil and thus do not implicate double jeopardy.  <citedDecision>Id., at 292</citedDecision> .  “We... hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution.” United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448-449 (1989).
