 Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, 249 U. S. 236 (1919); Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 252 U. S. 23 (1920).  These questions settled, the Court again was called upon in natural gas cases to consider state rate-making claimed to be invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment.  United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, 278 U. S. 300 (1929); United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, 278 U. S. 322 (1929).  Then, as now, the differences were “due chiefly to the difference in value ascribed by each to the gas rights and leaseholds.” 278 U. S. 300, 311 .  No one seems to have questioned that the rate base method must be pursued and the controversy was as to what rate base must be used.  Later the “value” of gas in the field was questioned in determining the amount a regulated company should be allowed to pay an affiliate therefor — a state determination also reviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 290</citedDecision> (1934); Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 292 U. S. 398 (1934).  In both cases, one of which sustained and one of which struck down a fixed rate, the Court assumed the rate base method as the legal way of testing reasonableness of natural gas prices fixed by public authority, without examining its real relevancy to the inquiry.  Under the weight of such precedents we cannot expect the Commission to initiate economically intelligent methods of fixing gas prices.  But the Court now faces a new plan of federal regulation based on the power to fix the price at which gas shall be allowed to move in interstate commerce.  I should now consider whether these rules devised under the Fourteenth Amendment are the exclusive tests of a just and reasonable rate under the federal statute, inviting reargument directed to that point *652 if necessary.  As I see it now I would be prepared to hold that these rules do not apply to a natural gas case arising under the Natural Gas Act.  Such a holding would leave the Commission to fix the price of gas in the field as one would fix maximum prices •of oil or milk or coal, or any other commodity.

 Report on Utility Corporations by Federal Trade Commission, Sen. Doc. 92, Pt. 84-A, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., 28.  In 1915, so it was reported to the Governor of West Virginia, 87 per cent of the total gas production of that state was under control of eight companies.  Steptoe and Hoffheimer, Legislative Regulation of Natural Gas Supply in West Virginia, 17 West Virginia Law Quarterly 257, 260.  Of these, three were subsidiaries of the Columbia system and others were subsidiaries of larger systems.  In view of inter-system sales and interlocking interests it may be doubted whether there is much real competition among these companies.  This pattern with its effects on local regulatory efforts will be observed in our decisions.  See United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, 278 U. S. 300 ; United Fuel Gas Co. v.
