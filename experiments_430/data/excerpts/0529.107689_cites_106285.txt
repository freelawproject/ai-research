**Lead Opinion**
Mr. Justice Fortas delivered the opinion of the Court. This case has a lengthy procedural history.  In 1960, petitioner was convicted of burglary and grand larceny in New York state court proceedings and was sentenced to concurrent terms of three to five years.  On direct appeal (following Mapp v. Ohio, <citedDecision>367 U. S. 643</citedDecision> (1961)), petitioner claimed that illegally obtained evidence had been introduced against him at trial. The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction without opinion, People v. Carafas, 14 App. Div. 2d 886, 218 N. Y. S. 2d 536 (1961), as did the New York Court of Appeals, 11 N. Y. 2d 891, 182 N. E. *236 2d 413 (1962).  1 This Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari.  372 U. S. 948 (1963).  Thereafter, complex proceedings took place in which petitioner sought in both federal and state courts to obtain relief by writ of habeas corpus, based on his claim that illegally seized evidence was used against him.  334 F. 2d 331 (1964); petition for writ of certiorari denied, 381 U. S. 951 (1965).  On November 5, 1965, the United States District Court, as directed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ( 334 F. 2d 331 (1964)), heard petitionerâ€™s claim on the merits.  It dismissed his petition on the ground that he had failed to show a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring. Although we joined the per curiam decision in Parker v. Ellis, 362 U. S. 574 , we are now persuaded that what the Court there decided was wrong insofar as it held that even though a man be in custody when he initiates *243 a habeas corpus proceeding, the statutory power of the federal courts to proceed to a final adjudication of his claims depends upon his remaining in custody. Consequently we concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court. Mr. Justice Harlan also notes that his views upon the issue discussed in his separate concurring opinion in Parker, id., at 576 , have not changed.
**Combined Opinion**
 CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.  *235 James J. Cally argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.  Brenda Soloff, Assistant Attorney General of New York, argued the cause for respondent.  With her on the brief were Louis J. Lefkowitz, Attorney General, Samuel A. Hirshowitz, First Assistant Attorney General, and Michael H. Rauch, Assistant Attorney General.  MR. JUSTICE FORTAS delivered the opinion of the Court. This case has a lengthy procedural history.
