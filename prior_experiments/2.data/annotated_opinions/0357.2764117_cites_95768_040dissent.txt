I cannot bring myself to believe that the Full Faith and Credit Clause gave to the few States which offer bargain-counter divorces constitutional power to control the social policy governing domestic relations of the many States which do not. [This is also a dissent to Coe v. Coe, post, p. 378.] Nor do I regard Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32, as contrary authority. That case did not depend for its result on the fact that there had been an adjudication of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the divorce enforced, inasmuch as this Court found that the State granting the divorce was in fact that of the domicile. 305 U. S. at 41. Moreover this Court’s citation therein of Andrews v. Andrews, *359 <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> indicates an absence of intention to overrule the holding of that case that opportunity to litigate the issue of domicile does not foreclose inquiry as to the true facts. Andrews v. Andrews has since been cited with respect, as recently as Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 309, 320, n. 7, and 325 U. S. 226, 229, 240, 242. Compare the English laws providing for a King’s Proctor to represent the interests of the Crown in divorce proceedings. Sections 5-7, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1860, 23 & 24 Vict., c. 144; § 1, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1873, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 31; § 181, The Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, 15 & 16 Geo. 5, c. 49, 9 Halsbury’s Statutes of England 393-94. Rev. L. 1835, c. 76: § 39.

See S. 1960,80th Cong., 2d Sess. The most vigorous efforts, however, have been made in the direction of securing uniform State legislation. President Theodore Roosevelt, in calling on Congress to provide for compilation of marriage and divorce statistics, included a suggestion of cooperation among the States in enacting uniform laws. 15 Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents 6942. On the initiative of the Governor of Pennsylvania, a National Congress on Uniform Divorce Laws, in which forty-two States were represented, was called in 1906. This Congress resolved that a constitutional amendment was not feasible and drafted resolutions concerning uniform State legislation. Lich-tenberger, <targetCase>supra, 191-96</targetCase>. See also Proceedings, National Congress on Uniform Divorce Laws (1906) passim; Proceedings 2d Meeting of the Governors of the States of the Union (1910) pp. 185-98. It is interesting to note that even these proponents of uniformity advocated that each State “adopt a statute embodying the principle contained in” the very Massachusetts statute now held unconstitutional by the Court perhaps in the interests of uniformity. Lichtenberger, <targetCase>supra, at 194</targetCase>. The bill prepared by the Congress was also approved by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (Proceedings, 17th Ann. Conf., Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (1907) pp. 120 et seq.) but was adopted by only three States. See pp. 360-361, supra.
