**Dissenting Opinion**
 The majority’s observation that in these cases there were alternative grounds that could have been used to reach the same result, ante, at 763, n. 8, disguises neither the fact that the holding that actually appears in these opinions rests on conspiracy between affiliated entities, nor that today’s holding is inconsistent with what was actually held in these cases. In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211 (1951), the Court’s holding was plain and unequivocal: *782 This holding is so clear that even the Court, which is not wanting for inventiveness in its reading of the prior cases, cannot explain it away.  The Court suggests only that today Kiefer-Stewart might be decided on alternative grounds, ante, at 764, ignoring the fact that today’s holding is inconsistent with the ground on which the case actually was decided.  4 *781 “Respondents next suggest that their status as ‘mere in-strumentalities of a single manufacturing-merchandizing unit’ makes it impossible for them to have conspired in a manner forbidden by the Sherman Act.  But this suggestion runs counter to our past decisions that common ownership and control does not liberate corporations from the impact of the antitrust laws.  E. g. United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218 .  The rule is especially applicable where, as here, respondents hold themselves out as competitors.” Id., at 215.  *782 A construction of the statute that reaches agreements between corporate parents and subsidiaries was again embraced by the Court in Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 598 (1951), 5 and Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., <citedDecision>392 U. S. 134</citedDecision> (1968).  6 The majority only notes that there might have been .  other grounds for decision available in these cases, ante, at 764-766, but again it cannot deny that its new rule is inconsistent with what the Court actually did write in these cases. *783 Thus, the rule announced today is inconsistent with what this Court has held on at least seven previous occasions.  7 Perhaps most illuminating is the fact that until today, whether they favored the doctrine or not, it had been the universal conclusion of both the lower courts 8 and the commentators 9 that this Court’s cases establish that a parent *784 and a wholly owned subsidiary corporation are capable of conspiring in violation of § 1.  In this very case the Court of Appeals observed: “[T]he salient factor is that the Supreme Court’s decisions, while they need not be read with complete literalism, of course they cannot be ignored.  It is no accident that every Court of Appeals to consider the question has concluded that a parent and its subsidiary have the same capacity to conspire, whether or not they can be found to have done so in a particular case.” 691 F. 2d 310 , 317 (CA7 1982) (footnotes omitted).  Thus, we are not writing on a clean slate.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Thus the Kiefer-Stewart Court considered and rejected exactly the same argument embraced by today’s majority.  “The fact that there is common ownership or control of the contracting corporations does not liberate them from the impact of the antitrust laws.  E. g., Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, [340 U. S.,] at 215.  Nor do we find any support in reason or authority for the proposition that agreements between legally separate persons and companies to suppress competition among themselves and others can be justified by labeling the project a ‘joint venture.’ Perhaps every agreement and combination to restrain trade could be so labeled.” 341 U. S., at 598.  “There remains for consideration only the Court of Appeals’ alternative holding that the Sherman Act claim should be dismissed because respondents were all part of a single business entity and were therefore entitled to cooperate without creating an illegal conspiracy.  But since respondents Midas and International availed themselves of the privilege of doing business through separate corporations, the fact of common ownership could not save them from any of the obligations that the law imposes on separate entities.  See Timken Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 593, 598 (1951); United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218, 227 (1947).” <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 141-142</citedDecision> .  Also pertinent is United, States v. Citizens & Southern National Bank, 422 U. S. 86 (1975), in which the Court wrote: “The central message of the Sherman Act is that a business entity must find new customers and higher profits through internal expansion — that is, by competing successfully rather than by arranging treaties with its competitors.  This Court has held that even commonly owned firms must compete against each other, if they hold themselves out as distinct entities.  ‘The corporate interrelationships of the conspirators .  .  .  are not determinative of the applicability of the Sherman Act.’ United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218, 227 .  See also Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211, 215 ; Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.
