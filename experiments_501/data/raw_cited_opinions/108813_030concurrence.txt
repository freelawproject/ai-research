<p id="b574-4">Although I join the opinion of the Court, I would add that I find unimpeachably correct the District Court’s conclusion that appellants failed to comply with the requirements of the Due Process Clause in denying renewal of appellees’ liquor licenses. Nevertheless, since the defendants named in the complaints were the municipalities of Kenosha and Racine, jurisdiction cannot be based on 28 U. S. C. § 1343. <em>Moor </em>v. <em>County of Alameda, </em>411 U. S. 693 (1973); <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, </em>365 U. S. 167 (1961). Appellees did assert 28 U. S. C. § 1331 as an alternative ground of jurisdiction, but I agree with the Court’s conclusion that existence of the requisite amount in controversy is not, on this record, clearly established. If appellees can prove their allegation that at least $10,000 is in controversy, then § 1331 jurisdiction is available, <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>327 U. S. 678 (1946); cf. <em>Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Fed. Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U. S. 388 (1971), and they are clearly entitled to relief.</p>
