<p id="b182-6">The issue in this case is whether the imposition of the sentence of death for the crime of murder under the law of Georgia violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>
<p id="b182-7">I</p>
<p id="b182-8">The petitioner, Troy Gregg, was charged with committing armed robbery and murder. In accordance with Georgia procedure in capital cases, the trial was in two stages, a guilt stage and a sentencing stage. The evidence at the guilt trial established that on November 21, 1973, the petitioner and a traveling companion, Floyd Allen, while hitchhiking north in Florida were picked up by Fred Simmons and Bob Moore. Their car broke down, but they continued north after Simmons purchased another vehicle with some of the cash he was carrying. While still in Florida, they picked up another hitchhiker, Dennis Weaver, who rode with them to Atlanta, where he was let out about 11 p. m. <page-number citation-index="1" label="159">*159</page-number>A short time later the four men interrupted their journey for a rest stop along the highway. The next morning the bodies of Simmons and Moore were discovered in a ditch nearby.</p>
<p id="b183-5">On November 23, after reading about the shootings in an Atlanta newspaper, Weaver comunicated with the Gwinnett County police and related information concerning the journey with the victims, including a description of the car. The next afternoon, the petitioner and Allen, while in Simmons’ car, were arrested in Asheville, N. C. In the search incident to the arrest a .25-caliber pistol, later shown to be that used to kill Simmons and Moore, was found in the petitioner’s pocket. After receiving the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107252"><a href="/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/" aria-description="Citation for case: Miranda v. Arizona">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), and signing a written waiver of his rights, the petitioner signed a statement in which he admitted shooting, then robbing Simmons and Moore. He justified the slayings on grounds of self-defense. The next day, while being transferred to Lawrence-ville, Ga., the petitioner and Allen were taken to the scene of the shootings. Upon arriving there, Allen recounted the events leading to the slayings. His version of these events was as follows: After Simmons and Moore left the car, the petitioner stated that he intended to rob them. The petitioner then took his pistol in hand and positioned himself on the car to improve his aim. As Simmons and Moore came up an embankment toward the car, the petitioner fired three shots and the two men fell near a ditch. The petitioner, at close range, then fired a shot into the head of each. He robbed them of valuables and drove away with Allen.</p>
<p id="b183-6">A medical examiner testified that Simmons died from a bullet wound in the eye and that Moore died from bullet wounds in the cheek and in the back of the head. He further testified that both men had several bruises <page-number citation-index="1" label="160">*160</page-number>and abrasions about the face and head which probably were sustained either from the fall into the ditch or from being dragged or pushed along the embankment. Although Allen did not testify, a police detective recounted the substance of Allen’s statements about the slayings and indicated that directly after Allen had made these statements the petitioner had admitted that Allen’s account was accurate. The petitioner testified in his own defense. He confirmed that Allen had made the statements described by the detective, but denied their truth or ever having admitted to their accuracy. He indicated that he had shot Simmons and Moore because of fear and in self-defense, testifying they had attacked Allen and him, one wielding a pipe and the other a knife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b184-5">The trial judge submitted the murder charges to the jury on both felony-murder and nonfelony-murder theories. He also instructed on the issue of self-defense but declined to instruct on manslaughter. He submitted the robbery case to the jury on both an armed-robbery theory and on the lesser included offense of robbery by intimidation. The jury found the petitioner guilty of two counts of armed robbery and two counts of murder.</p>
<p id="b184-6">At the penalty stage, which took place before the same jury, neither the prosecutor nor the petitioner’s lawyer offered any additional evidence. Both counsel, however, made lengthy arguments dealing generally with the propriety of capital punishment under the circumstances and with the weight of the evidence of guilt. The trial judge instructed the jury that it could recommend either a death sentence or a life prison sentence on each count. <page-number citation-index="1" label="161">*161</page-number>The judge further charged the jury that in determining what sentence was appropriate the jury was free to consider the facts and circumstances, if any, presented by the parties in mitigation or aggravation.</p>
<p id="b185-5">Finally, the judge instructed the jury that it “would not be authorized to consider [imposing] the penalty of death” unless it first found beyond a reasonable doubt-one of these aggravating circumstances:</p>
<blockquote id="b185-6">“One — That the offense of murder was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of two other capital felonies, to-wit the armed robbery of [Simmons and Moore].</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b185-7">“Two — That the offender committed the offense of murder for the purpose of receiving money and the automobile described in the indictment.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b185-8">“Three — The offense of murder was outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman, in that they [sic] involved the depravity of [the] mind of the .defendant.” Tr. 476-477.</blockquote>
<p id="b185-9">Finding the first and second of these circumstances, the jury returned verdicts of death on each count.</p>
<p id="b185-10">The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the convictions and the imposition of the death sentences for murder. <span class="citation" data-id="1335744"><a href="/opinion/1335744/gregg-v-state/" aria-description="Citation for case: Gregg v.

E. 2d 659</a></span> (1974). After reviewing the trial transcript and the record, including the evidence, and comparing the evidence and sentence in similar cases in accordance with the requirements of Georgia law, the court concluded that, considering the nature of the crime and the defendant, the sentences of death had not resulted from prejudice or any other arbitrary factor and were not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty applied in similar cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The death <page-number citation-index="1" label="162">*162</page-number>sentences imposed, for armed robbery, however, were vacated on the grounds that the death penalty had rarely been imposed in Georgia for that offense and that the jury improperly considered the murders as aggravating circumstances for the robberies after having considered the armed robberies as aggravating circumstances for the murders. <span class="citation" data-id="1335744"><a href="/opinion/1335744/gregg-v-state/#127" aria-description="Citation for case: Gregg v.

<p id="b186-5">We granted the petitioner’s application for a writ of certiorari limited to his challenge to the imposition of the death sentences in this case as “cruel and unusual” punishment in violation of the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendments. <span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./423/1082/">423 U.

<p id="b186-6">II</p>
<p id="b186-7">Before considering the issues presented it is necessary to understand the Georgia statutory scheme for the imposition of the death penalty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Georgia statute, as amended after our decision in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">408 U. S. 238</a></span> (1972), retains the death penalty for six categories of crime: murder,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> kidnaping for ransom or where <page-number citation-index="1" label="163">*163</page-number>the victim is harmed, armed robbery,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rape, treason, and aircraft hijacking.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <span class="citation no-link">Ga. Code Ann. §§ 26-1101</span>, 26-1311, 26-1902, 26-2001, 26-2201, 26-3301 (1972). The capital defendant’s guilt or innocence is determined in the traditional manner, either by a trial judge or a jury, in the first stage of a bifurcated trial.</p>
<p id="b187-5">If trial is by jury, the trial judge is required to charge lesser included offenses when they are supported by any view of the evidence. <em>Sims </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="3401349"><a href="/opinion/3406914/sims-v-state/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sims v.

See <em>Linder </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1306486"><a href="/opinion/1306486/linder-v-state/#625" aria-description="Citation for case: Linder v. State">132 Ga.

E. 2d 630, 631</a></span> (1974). After a verdict, finding, or plea of guilty to a capital crime, a presentence hearing is conducted before whoever made the determination of guilt. The sentencing procedures are essentially the same in both bench and jury trials. At the hearing:</p>
<blockquote id="b187-6">“[T]he judge [or jury] shall hear additional evidence in extenuation, mitigation, and aggravation of punishment, including the record of any prior criminal convictions and pleas of guilty or pleas of nolo contendere of the defendant, or the absence of any prior conviction and pleas: Provided, however, that <page-number citation-index="1" label="164">*164</page-number>only such evidence in aggravation as the State has made known to the defendant prior to his trial shall be admissible. The judge [or jury] shall also hear argument by the defendant or his counsel and the prosecuting attorney . . . regarding the punishment to be imposed.” §27-2503 (Supp. 1975).</blockquote>
<p id="b188-5">The defendant is accorded substantial latitude as to the types of evidence that he may introduce. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1301607"><a href="/opinion/1301607/brown-v-state/#647" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown v.

<p id="b188-6">In the assessment of the appropriate sentence to be imposed the judge is also required to consider or to include in his instructions to the jury “any mitigating circumstances or aggravating circumstances otherwise authorized by law and any of [10] statutory aggravating circumstances which may be supported by the evidence....” §27-2534.1 (b) (Supp. 1975). The scope of the non-statutory aggravating or mitigating circumstances is not delineated in the statute. Before a convicted defendant may be sentenced to death, however, except in cases of treason or aircraft hijacking, the jury, or the trial judge in cases tried without a jury, must find beyond a reasonable doubt one of the 10 aggravating circumstances speci-<page-number citation-index="1" label="165">*165</page-number>fled in the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The sentence of death may be imposed only if the jury (or judge) finds one of the statutory aggravating circumstances and then elects to <page-number citation-index="1" label="166">*166</page-number>impose that sentence. §26-3102 (Supp. 1975). If the verdict is death, the jury or judge must specify the aggravating circumstance(s) found. § 27-2534.1 (c) (Supp. 1975). In jury cases, the trial judge is bound by the jury’s recommended sentence. §§ 26-3102, 27-2514 (Supp. 1975).</p>
<p id="b190-5">In addition to the conventional appellate process available in all criminal cases, provision is made for special expedited direct review by the Supreme Court of Georgia of the appropriateness of imposing the sentence of death in the particular case. The court is directed to consider “the punishment as well as any errors enumerated by way of appeal,” and to determine:</p>
<blockquote id="b190-6">“(1) Whether the sentence of death was imposed <page-number citation-index="1" label="167">*167</page-number>under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and</blockquote>
<p id="b191-5">“(2) Whether, in cases other than treason or aircraft hijacking, the evidence supports the jury’s or judge’s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance as enumerated in section 27.2534.1 (b), and</p>
<p id="ApV">“(3) Whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.” §27-2537 (Supp. 1975).</p>
<p id="b191-6">If the court affirms a death sentence, it is required to include in its decision reference to similar cases that it has taken into consideration. § 27-2537 (e) (Supp. 1975).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b191-7">A transcript and complete record of the trial, as well as a separate report by the trial judge, are transmitted to the court for its use in reviewing the sentence. § 27-2537 (a) (Supp. 1975). The report is in the form of a 6%-page questionnaire, designed to elicit information about the defendant, the crime, and the circumstances of the trial. It requires the trial judge to characterize the trial in several ways designed to test for arbitrariness and disproportionality of sentence. Included in the report are responses to detailed questions concerning the quality of the defendant’s representation, whether race played a role in the trial, and, whether, in the trial court’s judgment, there was any doubt about <page-number citation-index="1" label="168">*168</page-number>the defendant's guilt or the appropriateness of the sentence. A copy of the report is served upon defense counsel. Under its special review authority, the court may either affirm the death sentence or remand the case for resentencing. In cases in which the death sentence is affirmed there remains the possibility of executive clemency.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b192-5">Ill</p>
<p id="b192-6">We address initially the basic contention that the punishment of death for the crime of murder is, under all circumstances, “cruel and unusual” in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. In Part IV of this opinion, we will consider the sentence of death imposed under the Georgia statutes at issue in this case.</p>
<p id="b192-7">The Court on a number of occasions has both assumed and asserted the constitutionality of capital punishment. In several cases that assumption provided a necessary foundation for the decision, as the Court was asked to decide whether a particular method of carrying out a capital sentence would be allowed to stand under the Eighth Amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But until <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">408 U. S. 238</a></span> (1972), the Court never confronted squarely the fundamental claim that the punishment of death always, regardless of the enormity of the offense or the procedure followed in imposing the sentence, is cruel and <page-number citation-index="1" label="169">*169</page-number>unusual punishment in violation of the Constitution. Although this issue was presented and addressed in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span>, </em>it was not resolved by the Court. Four Justices would have held that capital punishment is not unconstitutional <em>per </em>se;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> two Justices would have reached the opposite conclusion;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and three Justices, while agreeing that the statutes then before the Court were invalid as applied, left open the question whether such punishment may ever be imposed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We now hold that the punishment of death does not invariably violate the Constitution.</p>
<p id="b193-5">A</p>
<p id="b193-6">The history of the prohibition of “cruel and unusual” punishment already has been reviewed at length.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The phrase first appeared in the English Bill of Rights of 1689, which was drafted by Parliament at the accession of William and Mary. See Granucci, “Nor Cruel and Unusual Punishments Inflicted:” The Original Meaning, <span class="citation no-link">57 Calif. L. Rev. 839</span>, 852-853 (1969). The English version appears to have been directed against punishments unauthorized by statute and beyond the jurisdiction of the sentencing court, as well as those disproportionate to the offense involved. <span class="citation no-link"><em>Id., </em>at 860</span>. The <page-number citation-index="1" label="170">*170</page-number>American draftsmen, who adopted the English phrasing in drafting the Eighth Amendment, were primarily concerned, however, with proscribing “tortures” and other “barbarous” methods of punishment.” <span class="citation no-link"><em>Id., </em>at 842</span>.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b194-5">In the earliest cases raising Eighth Amendment claims, the Court focused on particular methods of execution to determine whether they were too cruel to pass constitutional muster. The constitutionality of the sentence of death itself was not at issue, and the criterion used to evaluate the mode of execution was its similarity to “torture” and other “barbarous” methods. See <em>Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Utah, </em><span class="citation" data-id="89923"><a href="/opinion/89923/wilkerson-v-utah/#136" aria-description="Citation for case: Wilkerson v. Utah">99 U. S. 130, 136</a></span> (1879) (“[I]t is safe to affirm that punishments of torture . . . and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbidden by that amendment . . .”); <em>In re Kemmler, </em><span class="citation" data-id="92834"><a href="/opinion/92834/in-re-kemmler/#447" aria-description="Citation for case: In Re Kemmler">136 U. S. 436, 447</a></span> (1890) (“Punishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death . . .”). See also <em>Louisiana ex rel. Francis </em>v. <em>Resweber, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104355"><a href="/opinion/104355/louisiana-ex-rel-francis-v-resweber/#464" aria-description="Citation for case: Louisiana Ex Rel. Francis v. Resweber">329 U. S. 459, 464</a></span> (1947) (second attempt at electrocution found not to violate <page-number citation-index="1" label="171">*171</page-number>Eighth Amendment, since failure of initial execution attempt was “an unforeseeable accident” and “[t]here [was] no purpose to inflict unnecessary pain nor any unnecessary pain involved in the proposed execution”).</p>
<p id="b195-5">But the Court has not confined the prohibition embodied in the Eighth Amendment to “barbarous” methods that were generally outlawed in the 18th century. Instead, the Amendment has been interpreted in a flexible and dynamic manner. The Court early recognized that “a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth.” <em>Weems </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="97242"><a href="/opinion/97242/weems-v-united-states/#373" aria-description="Citation for case: Weems v. United States">217 U. S. 349, 373</a></span> (1910). Thus the Clause forbidding “cruel and unusual” punishments “is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.” <span class="citation" data-id="97242"><a href="/opinion/97242/weems-v-united-states/#378" aria-description="Citation for case: Weems v.

That punishment included imprisonment for at least 12 years and one day, in chains, at hard and painful labor; the loss of many basic civil rights; and subjection to lifetime surveillance. Although the Court acknowledged the possibility that “the cruelty of pain” may be present in the challenged punishment, <span class="citation" data-id="97242"><a href="/opinion/97242/weems-v-united-states/#366" aria-description="Citation for case: Weems v.

<blockquote id="b195-7">“Such penalties for such offenses amaze those who have formed their conception of the relation of a state to even its offending citizens from the practice <page-number citation-index="1" label="172">*172</page-number>of the American commonwealths, and believe that it is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to offense.” <span class="citation" data-id="97242"><a href="/opinion/97242/weems-v-united-states/#366" aria-description="Citation for case: Weems v.

Although the concept of proportionality was not the basis of the holding, the plurality observed in dicta that “[fjines, imprisonment and even execution may be imposed depending upon the enormity of the crime.” <span class="citation" data-id="105659"><a href="/opinion/105659/trop-v-dulles/#100" aria-description="Citation for case: Trop v.

<p id="b196-6">The substantive limits imposed by the Eighth Amendment on what can be made criminal and punished were discussed in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106451"><a href="/opinion/106451/robinson-v-california/" aria-description="Citation for case: Robinson v. California">370 U. S. 660</a></span> (1962). The Court found unconstitutional a state statute that made the status of being addicted to a narcotic drug a criminal offense. It held, in effect, that it is “cruel and unusual” to impose any punishment at all for the mere status of addiction. The cruelty in the abstract of the actual sentence imposed was irrelevant: “Even one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the 'crime' of having a common cold.” <span class="citation" data-id="106451"><a href="/opinion/106451/robinson-v-california/#667" aria-description="Citation for case: Robinson v.

<p id="b196-7">It is clear from the foregoing precedents that the <page-number citation-index="1" label="173">*173</page-number>Eighth Amendment has not been regarded as a static concept. As Mr. Chief Justice Warren said, in an oft-quoted phrase, “[t]he Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="105659"><a href="/opinion/105659/trop-v-dulles/" aria-description="Citation for case: Trop v.

Thus, an assessment of contemporary values concerning the infliction of a challenged sanction is relevant to the application of the Eighth Amendment. As we develop below more fully, see <em>infra, </em>at 175-176, this assessment does not call for a subjective judgment. It requires, rather, that we look to objective indicia that reflect the public attitude toward a given sanction.</p>
<p id="b197-5">But our cases also make clear that public perceptions of standards of decency with respect to criminal sanctions are not conclusive. A penalty also must accord with “the dignity of man,” which is the “basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="105659"><a href="/opinion/105659/trop-v-dulles/" aria-description="Citation for case: Trop v.

This means, at least, that the punishment not be “excessive.” When a form of punishment in the abstract (in this case, whether capital punishment may ever be imposed as a sanction for murder) rather than in the particular (the propriety of death as a penalty to be applied to a specific defendant for a specific crime) is under consideration, the inquiry into “excessiveness” has two aspects.

<p id="b200-6">In the discussion to this point we have sought to identify the principles and considerations that guide a court in addressing an Eighth Amendment claim. We now consider specifically whether the sentence of death for the crime of murder is a <em>per se </em>violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. We note first that history and precedent strongly support a negative answer to this question.</p>
<p id="b200-7">The imposition of the death penalty for the crime of murder has a long history of acceptance both in the United States and in England. The common-law rule <page-number citation-index="1" label="177">*177</page-number>imposed a mandatory death sentence on all convicted murderers. <em>McGautha </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108329"><a href="/opinion/108329/mcgautha-v-california/#197" aria-description="Citation for case: McGautha v. California">402 U. S. 183, 197-198</a></span> (1971). And the penalty continued to be used into the 20th century by most American States, although the breadth of the common-law rule was diminished, initially by narrowing the class of murders to be punished by death and subsequently by widespread adoption of laws expressly granting juries the discretion to recommend mercy. <span class="citation" data-id="108329"><a href="/opinion/108329/mcgautha-v-california/#199" aria-description="Citation for case: McGautha v. California"><em>Id., </em>at 199-200</a></span>. See <em>Woodson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, post, </em>at 289-292.</p>
<p id="b201-5">It is apparent from the text of the Constitution itself that the existence of capital punishment was accepted by the Framers. At the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, capital punishment was a common sanction in every State. Indeed, the First Congress of the United States enacted legislation providing death as the penalty for specified crimes. C. 9, <span class="citation no-link">1 Stat. 112</span> (1790). The Fifth Amendment, adopted at the same time as the Eighth, contemplated the continued existence of the capital sanction by imposing certain limits on the prosecution of capital cases:</p>
<blockquote id="b201-6">“No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury . . . ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; . . . nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . .</blockquote>
<p id="b201-7">And the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted over three-quarters of a century later, similarly contemplates the existence of the capital sanction in providing that no State shall deprive any person of “life, liberty, or property” without due process of law.</p>
<p id="b201-8">For nearly two centuries, this Court, repeatedly and <page-number citation-index="1" label="178">*178</page-number>often expressly, has recognized that capital punishment is not invalid per <em>se. </em>In <em><span class="citation" data-id="89923"><a href="/opinion/89923/wilkerson-v-utah/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wilkerson v. Utah">Wilkerson</a></span> </em>v. <em>Utah, </em><span class="citation" data-id="89923"><a href="/opinion/89923/wilkerson-v-utah/#134" aria-description="Citation for case: Wilkerson v. Utah">99 U. S., at 134-135</a></span>, where the Court found no constitutional violation in inflicting death by public shooting, it said:</p>
<blockquote id="b202-5">“Cruel and unusual punishments are forbidden by the Constitution, but the authorities referred to are quite sufficient to show that the punishment of shooting as a mode of executing the death penalty for the crime of murder in the first degree is not included in that category, within the meaning of the eighth amendment.”</blockquote>
<p id="b202-6">Rejecting the contention that death by electrocution was “cruel and unusual,” the Court in <span class="citation" data-id="92834"><a href="/opinion/92834/in-re-kemmler/#447" aria-description="Citation for case: In Re Kemmler"><em>In re Kemmler, supra, </em>at 447</a></span>, reiterated:</p>
<blockquote id="b202-7">“[T]he punishment of death is not cruel, within the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution. It implies there something inhuman and barbarous, something more than the mere extinguishment of life.”</blockquote>
<p id="b202-8">Again, in <em><span class="citation" data-id="104355"><a href="/opinion/104355/louisiana-ex-rel-francis-v-resweber/" aria-description="Citation for case: Louisiana Ex Rel. Francis v.

Francis v. Resweber">329 U. S., at 464</a></span>, the Court remarked: “The cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted man is cruelty inherent in the method of punishment, not the necessary suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely.” And in <em><span class="citation" data-id="105659"><a href="/opinion/105659/trop-v-dulles/" aria-description="Citation for case: Trop v.

S., at 99</a></span>, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, for himself and three other Justices, wrote:</p>
<blockquote id="b202-9">“Whatever the arguments may be against capital punishment, both on moral grounds and in terms of accomplishing the purposes of punishment . . . the death penalty has been employed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is still widely accepted, it cannot be said to violate the constitutional concept of cruelty.”</blockquote>
<p id="b203-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="179">*179</page-number>Four years ago, the petitioners in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>and its companion cases predicated their argument primarily upon the asserted proposition that standards of decency had evolved to the point where capital punishment no longer could be tolerated. The petitioners in those cases said, in effect, that the evolutionary process had come to an end, and that standards of decency required that the Eighth Amendment be construed finally as prohibiting capital punishment for any crime regardless of its depravity and impact on society. This view was accepted by two Justices.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Three other Justices were unwilling to go so far; focusing on the procedures by which convicted defendants were selected for the death penalty rather than on the actual punishment inflicted, they joined in the conclusion that the statutes before the Court were constitutionally invalid.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b203-5">The petitioners in the capital cases before the Court today renew the "standards of decency” argument, but developments during the four years since <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>have undercut substantially the assumptions upon which their argument rested. Despite the continuing debate, dating back to the 19th century, over the morality and utility of capital punishment, it is now evident that a large proportion of American society continues to regard it as an appropriate and necessary criminal sanction.</p>
<p id="b203-6">The most marked indication of society's endorsement of the death penalty for murder is the legislative response to <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span>. </em>The legislatures of at least 35 States<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> have enacted new statutes that provide for the <page-number citation-index="1" label="180">*180</page-number>death penalty for at least some crimes that result in the death of another person. And the Congress of the United States, in 1974, enacted a statute providing the death penalty for aircraft piracy that results in death.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> These recently adopted statutes have attempted to address the concerns expressed by the Court in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>primarily (i) by specifying the factors to be weighed and the procedures to be followed in deciding when to impose a capital sentence, or (ii) by .making the death penalty mandatory for specified crimes. But all of the <em>post-Furman </em>statutes make clear that capital punish<page-number citation-index="1" label="181">*181</page-number>ment itself has not been rejected by the elected representatives of the people.</p>
<p id="b205-5">In the only statewide referendum occurring since <em>Fur-man </em>and brought to our attention, the people of California adopted a constitutional amendment that authorized capital punishment, in effect negating a prior ruling by the Supreme Court of California in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1260876"><a href="/opinion/1260876/people-v-anderson/" aria-description="Citation for case: People v.

<p id="b205-6">The jury also is a significant and reliable objective index of contemporary values because it is so directly involved. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v.

The Court has said that “one of the most important functions any jury can perform in making ... a selection [between life imprisonment and death for a defendant convicted in a capital case] is to maintain a link between contemporary community values and the penal system.” <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107715"><a href="/opinion/107715/witherspoon-v-illinois/" aria-description="Citation for case: Witherspoon v. Illinois">391 U. S. 510</a></span>, 519 n. 15 (1968). It may be true that evolving standards have influenced juries in <page-number citation-index="1" label="182">*182</page-number>recent decades to be more discriminating in imposing the sentence of death.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But the relative infrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death sentence does not indicate rejection of capital punishment <em>per se. </em>Rather, the reluctance of juries in many cases to impose the sentence may well reflect the humane feeling that this most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a small number of extreme cases. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v.

Indeed, the actions of juries in many States since <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>are fully compatible with the legislative judgments, reflected in the new statutes, as to the continued utility and necessity of capital punishment in appropriate cases. At the close of 1974 at least 254 persons had been sentenced to death since Furman,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and by the end of March 1976, more than 460 persons were subject to death sentences.</p>
<p id="b206-5">As we have seen, however, the Eighth Amendment demands more than that a challenged punishment be acceptable to contemporary society. The Court also must ask whether it comports with the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the Amendment. <em><span class="citation" data-id="105659"><a href="/opinion/105659/trop-v-dulles/" aria-description="Citation for case: Trop v.

Indeed, the decision that capital punishment may be the appropriate sanction in extreme cases is an expression of the community’s belief that certain crimes are themselves so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b208-5">Statistical attempts to evaluate the worth of the death penalty as a deterrent to crimes by potential offenders have occasioned a great deal of debate.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The results <page-number citation-index="1" label="185">*185</page-number>simply have been inconclusive. As one opponent of capital punishment has said:</p>

<blockquote id="b209-6">"The inescapable flaw is . . . that social conditions in any state are not constant through time, and that social conditions are not the same in any two states. If an effect were observed (and the observed effects, one way or another, are not large) then one could not at all tell whether any of this effect is attributable to the presence or absence of capital punishment. A 'scientific’ — that is to say, a soundly based — conclusion is simply impossible, and no methodological path out of this tangle suggests itself.” C. Black, Capital Punishment: The Inevitability of Caprice and Mistake 25-26 (1974).</blockquote>
<p id="b209-7">Although some of the studies suggest that the death penalty may not function as a significantly greater deterrent than lesser penalties,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> there is no convincing empirical evidence either supporting or refuting this view. We may nevertheless assume safely that there are murderers, such as those who act in passion, for whom the threat of death has little or no deterrent effect. But for many others, the death penalty undoubtedly is a signifi<page-number citation-index="1" label="186">*186</page-number>cant deterrent. There are carefully contemplated murders, such as murder for hire, where the possible penalty of death may well enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> And there are some categories of murder, such as murder by a life prisoner, where other sanctions may not be adequate.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b210-4">The value of capital punishment as a deterrent of crime is a complex factual issue the resolution of which properly rests with the legislatures, which can evaluate the results of statistical studies in terms of their own local conditions and with a flexibility of approach that is not available to the courts. <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v.

Georgia"><em>Georgia, </em>supra, at 403-405</a></span> (Burger, C. J., dissenting). Indeed, many of the <em>post-Furman </em>statutes reflect just such a responsible effort to define those crimes and those criminals for which capital punishment is most probably an effective deterrent.</p>
<p id="b210-5">In sum, we cannot say that the judgment of the Georgia Legislature that capital punishment may be necessary in some cases is clearly wrong. Considerations of federalism, as well as respect for the ability of a legislature <page-number citation-index="1" label="187">*187</page-number>to evaluate, in terms of its particular State, the moral consensus concerning the death penalty and its social utility as a sanction, require us to conclude, in the absence of more convincing evidence, that the infliction of death as a punishment for murder is not without justification and thus is not unconstitutionally severe.</p>
<p id="b211-5">Finally, we must consider whether the punishment of death is disproportionate in relation to the crime for which it is imposed. There is no question that death as a punishment is unique in its severity and irrevocability. <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v.

But we are concerned here only with the imposition of capital punishment for the crime of murder, and when a life has been taken deliberately by the offender,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> we cannot say that the punishment is invariably disproportionate to the crime.

<p id="b214-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="190">*190</page-number>The cited studies assumed that the trial judge would be the sentencing authority. If an experienced trial judge, who daily faces the difficult task of imposing sentences, has a vital need for accurate information about a defendant and the crime he committed in order to be able to impose a rational sentence in the typical criminal case, then accurate sentencing information is an indispensable prerequisite to a reasoned determination of whether a defendant shall live or die by a jury of people who may never before have made a sentencing decision.</p>
<p id="b214-5">Jury sentencing has been considered desirable in capital cases in order “to maintain a link between contemporary community values and the penal system — a link without which the determination of punishment could hardly reflect ‘the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.’ ” <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> But it creates special problems. Much of the information that is relevant to the sentencing decision may have no relevance to the question of guilt, or may even be extremely prejudicial to a fair determination of that question.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> This problem, however, is scarcely insurmountable. Those who have studied the question suggest that a bifurcated procedure — one in which the <page-number citation-index="1" label="191">*191</page-number>question of sentence is not considered until the determination of guilt has been made — is the best answer. The drafters of the Model Penal Code concluded:</p>
<blockquote id="b215-5">“ [If a unitary proceeding is used] the determination of the punishment must be based on less than all the evidence that has a bearing on that issue, such for example as a previous criminal record of the accused, or evidence must be admitted on the ground that it is relevant to sentence, though it would be excluded as irrelevant or prejudicial with respect to guilt or innocence alone. Trial lawyers understandably have little confidence in a solution that admits the evidence and trusts to an instruction to the jury that it should be considered only in determining the penalty and disregarded in assessing guilt.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b215-6"><em>. </em>. The obvious solution ... is to bifurcate the proceeding, abiding strictly by the rules of evidence until and unless there is a conviction, but once guilt has been determined opening the record to the further information that is relevant to sentence. This is the analogue of the procedure in the ordinary case when capital punishment is not in issue; the court conducts a separate inquiry before imposing sentence.” ALI, Model Penal Code § 201.6, Comment 5, pp. 74 — 75 (Tent. Draft No. 9, 1959).</blockquote>

Pa. L. Rev. 1099</span>, 1135-1136 (1953). When a human life is at stake and when the jury must have information prejudicial to the question of guilt but relevant to the question of penalty in order to impose a rational sentence, a bifur<page-number citation-index="1" label="192">*192</page-number>cated system is more likely to ensure elimination of the constitutional deficiencies identified in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v.

<p id="b216-5">But the provision of relevant information under fair procedural rules is not alone sufficient to guarantee that the information will be properly used in the imposition of punishment, especially if sentencing is performed by a jury. Since the members of a jury will have had little, if any, previous experience in sentencing, they are unlikely to be skilled in dealing with the information they are given. See American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures, § 1.1 (b), Commentary, pp. 46-47 (Approved Draft 1968); President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice: The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society, Task Force Report: The Courts 26 (1967). To the extent that this problem is inherent in jury sentencing, it may not be totally cor-rectible. It seems clear, however, that the problem will be alleviated if the jury is given guidance regarding the factors about the crime and the defendant that the State, representing organized society, deems particularly relevant to the sentencing decision.</p>
<p id="b216-6">The idea that a jury should be given guidance in its <page-number citation-index="1" label="193">*193</page-number>decisionmaking is also hardly a novel proposition. Juries are invariably given careful instructions on the law and how to apply it before they are authorized to decide the merits of a lawsuit. It would be virtually unthinkable to follow any other course in a legal system that has traditionally operated by following prior precedents and fixed rules of law.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> See <em>Gasoline Products Co. </em>v. <em>Champlin Refining Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="101754"><a href="/opinion/101754/gasoline-products-co-v-champlin-refining-co/#498" aria-description="Citation for case: Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co.">283 U. S. 494, 498</a></span> (1931); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 51. When erroneous instructions are given, retrial is often required. It is quite simply a hallmark of our legal system that juries be carefully and adequately guided in their deliberations.</p>
<p id="b217-5">While some have suggested that standards to guide a capital jury's sentencing deliberations are impossible to formulate,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> the fact is that such standards have been developed. When the drafters of the Model Penal Code faced this problem, they concluded “that it is within the realm of possibility to point to the main circumstances of aggravation and of mitigation that should be weighed <em>and weighed against each other </em>when they are presented in a concrete case." ALI, Model Penal Code § 201.6, Comment. 3, p. 71 (Tent. Draft No. 9, 1959) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> While such standards are by <page-number citation-index="1" label="194">*194</page-number>necessity somewhat general, they do provide guidance to the sentencing authority and thereby reduce the likelihood that it will impose a sentence that fairly can be <page-number citation-index="1" label="195">*195</page-number>called capricious or arbitrary.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Where the sentencing authority is required to specify the factors it relied upon in reaching its decision, the further safeguard of meaningful appellate review is available to ensure that death sentences are not imposed capriciously or in a freakish manner.</p>
<p id="b219-5">In summary, the concerns expressed in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>that the penalty of death not be imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner can be met by a carefully drafted statute that ensures that the sentencing authority is given adequate information and guidance. As a general proposition these concerns are best met by a system that provides for a bifurcated proceeding at which the sentencing authority is apprised of the information relevant to the imposition of sentence and provided with standards to guide its use of the information.</p>
<p id="b219-6">We do not intend to suggest that only the above-described procedures would be permissible under <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>or that any sentencing system constructed along these general lines would inevitably satisfy the concerns of Furman,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> for each distinct system must be examined on an individual basis. Rather, we have embarked upon this general exposition to make clear that it is possible to construct capital-sentencing systems capable of meeting Furman’s constitutional concerns.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b220-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="196">*196</page-number>B</p>
<p id="b220-4">We now turn to consideration of the constitutionality of Georgia’s capital-sentencing procedures. In the wake of <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span>, </em>Georgia amended its capital punishment statute, but chose not to narrow the scope of its murder provisions. See Part II, <em>supra. </em>Thus, now as before <em>Fur-man, </em>in Georgia “[a] person commits murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied, causes the death of another human being.” Ga. Code Ann., § 26-1101 (a) (1972). All persons convicted of murder “shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for life.” § 26-1101 (c) (1972).</p>
<p id="b220-5">Georgia did act, however, to narrow the class of murderers subject to capital punishment by specifying 10 <page-number citation-index="1" label="197">*197</page-number>statutory aggravating circumstances, one of which must be found by the jury to exist beyond a reasonable doubt before a death sentence can ever be imposed.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In addition, the jury is authorized to consider any other appropriate aggravating or mitigating circumstances. § 27-2534.1 (b) (Supp. 1975). The jury is not required to find any mitigating circumstance in order to make a recommendation of mercy that is binding on the trial court, see § 27-2302 (Supp. 1975), but it must find a <em>statutory </em>aggravating circumstance before recommending a sentence of death.</p>
<p id="b221-5">These procedures require the jury to consider the circumstances of the crime and the criminal before it recommends sentence. No longer can a Georgia jury do as Furman's jury did: reach a finding of the defendant’s guilt and then, without guidance or direction, decide whether he should live or die. Instead, the jury’s attention is directed to the specific circumstances of the crime: Was it committed hr the course of another capital felony? Was it committed for money? Was it committed upon a peace officer or judicial officer? Was it committed in a particularly heinous way or in a manner that endangered the lives of many persons? In addition, the jury’s attention is focused on the characteristics of the person who committed the crime: Does he have a record of prior convictions for capital offenses? Are there any special facts about this defendant that mitigate against imposing capital punishment (e. <em>g., </em>his youth, the extent of his cooperation with the police, his emotional state at the time of the crime).<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> As a result, while <page-number citation-index="1" label="198">*198</page-number>some jury discretion still exists, “the discretion to be exercised is controlled by clear and objective standards so as to produce non-discriminatory application.” <em>Coley </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1220970"><a href="/opinion/1220970/coley-v-state/#834" aria-description="Citation for case: Coley v.

E. 2d 612, 615</a></span> (1974).</p>
<p id="b222-5">As an important additional safeguard against arbitrariness and caprice, the Georgia statutory scheme provides for automatic appeal of all death sentences to the State’s Supreme Court. That court is required by statute to review each sentence of death and determine whether it was imposed under the influence of passion or prejudice, whether the evidence supports the jury’s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and whether the sentence is disproportionate compared to those sentences imposed in similar cases. § 27-2537 (c) (Supp. 1975).</p>
<p id="b222-6">In short, Georgia’s new sentencing procedures require as a prerequisite to the imposition of the death penalty, specific jury findings as to the circumstances of the crime or the character of the defendant. Moreover, to guard further against a situation comparable to that presented in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span>, </em>the Supreme Court of Georgia compares each death sentence with the sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants to ensure that the sentence of death in a particular case is not disproportionate. On their face these procedures seem to satisfy the concerns of <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v.

<p id="b222-7">The petitioner contends, however, that the changes in the Georgia sentencing procedures are only cosmetic, that the arbitrariness and capriciousness condemned by <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>continue to exist in Georgia — both in traditional practices that still remain and in the new sentencing procedures adopted in response to <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v.

<p id="b223-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="199">*199</page-number>1</p>
<p id="b223-5">First, the petitioner focuses on the opportunities for discretionary action that are inherent in the processing of any murder case under Georgia law. He notes that the state prosecutor has unfettered authority to select those persons whom he wishes to prosecute for a capital offense and to plea bargain with them. Further, at the trial the jury may choose to convict a defendant of a lesser included offense rather than find him guilty of a crime punishable by death, even if the evidence would support a capital verdict. And finally, a defendant who is convicted and sentenced to die may have his sentence commuted by the Governor of the State and the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles.</p>
<p id="b223-6">The existence of these discretionary stages is not determinative of the issues before us. At each of these stages an actor in the criminal justice system makes a decision which may remove a defendant from consideration as a candidate for the death penalty. <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span>, </em>in contrast, dealt with the decision to impose the death sentence on a specific individual who had been convicted of a capital offense. Nothing in any of our cases suggests that the decision to afford an individual defendant mercy violates the Constitution. <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>held only that, in order to minimize the risk that the death penalty would be imposed on a capriciously selected group of offenders, the decision to impose it had to be guided by standards so that the sentencing authority would focus on the particularized circumstances of the crime and the defendant.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b224-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="200">*200</page-number>2</p>
<p id="b224-5">The petitioner further contends that the capital-sentencing procedures adopted by Georgia in response to <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v.

Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>to be violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. He claims that the statute is so broad and vague as to leave juries free to act as arbitrarily and capriciously as they wish in deciding whether to impose the death penalty. While there is no claim that the jury in this case relied upon a vague or overbroad provision to establish the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance, the petitioner looks to the sentencing system as a whole (as the Court did in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>and we do today) and argues that it fails to reduce sufficiently the risk of arbitrary infliction of death sentences. Specifically, Gregg urges that the statutory aggravating circumstances are too broad and too vague, that the sentencing procedure allows for arbitrary grants of mercy, and that the scope of the evidence and argument that can be considered at the presentence hearing is too wide.</p>
<p id="b225-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="201">*201</page-number>The petitioner attacks the seventh statutory aggravating circumstance, which authorizes imposition of the death penalty if the murder was “outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim/’ contending that it is so broad that capital punishment could be imposed in any murder case.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> It is, of course, arguable that any murder involves depravity of mind or an aggravated battery. But this language need not be construed in this way, and there is no reason to assume that the Supreme Court of Georgia will adopt such an open-ended construction.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> In only one case has it upheld a jury’s decision to sentence a defendant to death when the only statutory aggravating circumstance found was that of the seventh, see <em>McCorquodale </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1323558"><a href="/opinion/1323558/mccorquodale-v-state/" aria-description="Citation for case: McCorquodale v.

E. 2d 577</a></span> (1974), and that homicide was a horrifying torture-murder.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b226-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="202">*202</page-number>The petitioner also argues that two of the statutory aggravating circumstances are vague and therefore susceptible of widely differing interpretations, thus creating a substantial risk that the death penalty will be arbitrarily inflicted by Georgia juries.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> In light of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia we must disagree. First, the petitioner attacks that part of § 27-2534.1 (b) (1) that authorizes a jury to consider whether a defendant has a “substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions.” The Supreme Court of Georgia, however, has demonstrated a concern that the new sentencing procedures provide guidance to juries. It held this provision to be impermissibly vague in <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1292960"><a href="/opinion/1292960/arnold-v-state/#540" aria-description="Citation for case: Arnold v. State">236 Ga. 534, 540</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="1292960"><a href="/opinion/1292960/arnold-v-state/#391" aria-description="Citation for case: Arnold v. State">224 S. E. 2d 386, 391</a></span> (1976), because it did not provide the jury with “sufficiently 'clear and objective standards.’ ” Second, the petitioner points to § 27-2534.1 (b)(3) which speaks of creating a “great risk of death to more than one person.” While such a phrase might be susceptible of an overly broad interpretation, the Supreme Court of Georgia has not so construed it. The only case in which the court upheld a conviction in reliance on this aggravating circumstance involved a man who stood up in a church and fired a gun indiscriminately into the audience. See <page-number citation-index="1" label="203">*203</page-number><em>Chenault </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1320446"><a href="/opinion/1320446/chenault-v-state/" aria-description="Citation for case: Chenault v. State">234 Ga. 216</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="1391242"><a href="/opinion/1391242/brooks-v-crum/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brooks v. Crum">216 S. E. 2d 223</a></span> (1975). On the other hand, the court expressly reversed a finding of great risk when the victim was simply kid-naped in a parking lot. See <em>Jarrell </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1391146"><a href="/opinion/1391146/jarrell-v-state/#424" aria-description="Citation for case: Jarrell v. State">234 Ga. 410, 424</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="1391146"><a href="/opinion/1391146/jarrell-v-state/#269" aria-description="Citation for case: Jarrell v. State">216 S. E. 2d 258, 269</a></span> (1975).<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b227-5">The petitioner next argues that the requirements of <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>are not met here because the jury has the power to decline to impose the death penalty even if it finds that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances are present in the case. This contention misinterprets <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span>. </em>See <em>supra, </em>at 198-199. Moreover, it ignores the role of the Supreme Court of Georgia which reviews each death sentence to determine whether it is proportional to other sentences imposed for similar crimes. Since the proportionality requirement on review is intended to prevent caprice in the decision to inflict the penalty, the isolated decision of a jury to afford mercy does not render unconstitutional death sentences imposed on defendants who were sentenced under a system that does not create a substantial risk of arbitrariness or caprice.</p>
<p id="b227-6">The petitioner objects, finally, to the wide scope of evidence and argument allowed at presentence hearings. We think that the Georgia court wisely has chosen not to impose unnecessary restrictions on the evidence that can be offered at such a hearing and to approve open and far-ranging argument. See, <em>e. g., Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1301607"><a href="/opinion/1301607/brown-v-state/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown v. State">235 Ga. 644</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="1301607"><a href="/opinion/1301607/brown-v-state/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown v. State">220 S. E. 2d 922</a></span> (1975). So long as the <page-number citation-index="1" label="204">*204</page-number>evidence introduced and the arguments made at the pre-sentence hearing do not prejudice a defendant, it is preferable not to impose restrictions. We think it desirable for the jury to have as much information before it as possible when it makes the sentencing decision. See <em>supra, </em>at 189-190.</p>
<p id="b228-5">3</p>
<p id="b228-6">Finally, the Georgia statute has an additional provision designed to assure that the death penalty will not be imposed on a capriciously selected group of convicted defendants. The new sentencing procedures require that the State Supreme Court review every death sentence to determine whether it was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, whether the evidence supports the findings of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and “[wjhether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.” § 27-2537 (c) (3) (Supp. 1975).<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In per<page-number citation-index="1" label="205">*205</page-number>forming its sentence-review function, the Georgia court has held that “if the death penalty is only rarely imposed for an act or it is substantially out of line with sentences imposed for other acts it will be set aside as excessive.” <em>Coley </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1220970"><a href="/opinion/1220970/coley-v-state/#834" aria-description="Citation for case: Coley v.

The court on another occasion stated that “we view it to be our duty under the similarity standard to assure that no death sentence is affirmed unless in similar cases throughout the state the death penalty has been imposed generally . . . <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1381163"><a href="/opinion/1381163/moore-v-state/#864" aria-description="Citation for case: Moore v.

E. 2d, at 270 (standard is whether “juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty”); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1341616"><a href="/opinion/1341616/smith-v-state/#24" aria-description="Citation for case: Smith v.

E. 2d 308, 318</a></span> (1976) (found “a clear pattern” of jury behavior).</p>
<p id="b229-5">It is apparent that the Supreme Court of Georgia has taken its review responsibilities seriously. In <em><span class="citation" data-id="1220970"><a href="/opinion/1220970/coley-v-state/" aria-description="Citation for case: Coley v. State">Coley</a></span>, </em>it held that “[t]he prior cases indicate that the past practice among juries faced with similar factual situations and like aggravating circumstances has been to impose only the sentence of life imprisonment for the offense of rape, rather than death.” <span class="citation" data-id="1220970"><a href="/opinion/1220970/coley-v-state/#835" aria-description="Citation for case: Coley v. State">231 Ga., at 835</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="1220970"><a href="/opinion/1220970/coley-v-state/#617" aria-description="Citation for case: Coley v. State">204 S. E. 2d, at 617</a></span>. It thereupon reduced Coley's sentence from death to life imprisonment. Similarly, although armed robbery is a capital offense under Georgia law, § 26-1902 (1972), the Georgia court concluded that the death sentences imposed in this case for that crime were “unusual in that they are rarely imposed for [armed robbery], Thus, under the test provided by statute, . . . they must be considered to be excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.” 233 <page-number citation-index="1" label="206">*206</page-number>Ga., at 127, <span class="citation" data-id="1335744"><a href="/opinion/1335744/gregg-v-state/#667" aria-description="Citation for case: Gregg v. State">210 S. E. 2d, at 667</a></span>. The court therefore vacated Gregg's death sentences for armed robbery and has followed a similar course in every other armed robbery death penalty case to come before it. See <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1335687"><a href="/opinion/1335687/floyd-v-state/#285" aria-description="Citation for case: Floyd v.

<p id="b230-5">The provision for appellate review in the Georgia capital-sentencing system serves as a check against the random or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In particular, the proportionality review substantially eliminates the possibility that a person will be sentenced to die by the action of an aberrant jury. If a time comes when juries generally do not impose the death sentence in a certain kind of murder case, the appellate review procedures assure that no defendant convicted under such circumstances will suffer a sentence of death.</p>
<p id="b230-6">V</p>
<p id="b230-7">The basic concern of <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>centered on those defendants who were being condemned to death capriciously and arbitrarily. Under the procedures before the Court in that case, sentencing authorities were not directed to give attention to the nature or circumstances of the crime committed or to the character or record of the defendant. Left unguided, juries imposed the death sentence in a way that could only be called freakish. The new Georgia sentencing procedures, by contrast, focus the jury’s attention on the particularized nature of the crime and the particularized characteristics of the individual defendant. While the jury is permitted to consider any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, it must find and identify at least one statutory aggravating factor before it may impose a penalty of death. In this way the jury's discretion is channeled. No longer <page-number citation-index="1" label="207">*207</page-number>can a jury wantonly and freakishly impose the death sentence; it is always circumscribed by the legislative guidelines. In addition, the review function of the Supreme Court of Georgia affords additional assurance that the concerns that prompted our decision in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>are not present to any significant degree in the Georgia procedure applied here.</p>
<p id="b231-5">For the reasons expressed in this opinion, we hold that the statutory system under which Gregg was sentenced to death does not violate the Constitution. Accordingly, the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court is affirmed.</p>

The truth is that some crimes are so outrageous that society insists on adequate punishment, because the wrong-doer deserves it, irrespective of whether it is a deterrent or not.” Royal Commission on Capital -Punishment, Minutes of Evidence, Dec. 1, 1949, p. 207 (1950).</blockquote>

In view of <em>Furman, McGautha </em>can be viewed rationally as a precedent only for the proposition that standardless jury sentencing procedures were not employed in the cases there before the Court so as to violate the Due Process Clause. We note that McGautha!s assumption that it is not possible to devise standards to guide and regularize jury sentencing in capital cases has been undermined by subsequent experience. In view of that experience and the considerations set forth in the text, we adhere to <em>Furman’s </em>determination that where the ultimate punishment of death is at issue ■ a system of standardless jury discretion violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>

<p id="b223-7"> The petitioner’s argument is nothing more than a veiled contention that <em><span class="citation" data-id="108605"><a href="/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Furman v. Georgia">Furman</a></span> </em>indirectly outlawed capital punishment by placing totally unrealistic conditions on its use. In order to repair the alleged defects pointed to by the petitioner, it would be necessary to require that prosecuting authorities charge a capital offense whenever arguably there had been a capital murder and that they <page-number citation-index="1" label="200">*200</page-number>refuse to plea bargain with, the defendant. If a jury refused to convict even though the evidence supported the charge, its verdict would have to be reversed and a verdict of guilty entered or a new trial ordered, since the discretionary act of jury nullification would not be permitted. Finally, acts of executive clemency would have to be prohibited. Such a system, of course, would be totally alien to our notions of criminal justice.</p>
<p id="b224-7">Moreover, it would be unconstitutional. Such a system in many respects would have the vices of the mandatory death penalty statutes we hold unconstitutional today in <em>Woodson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, post, </em>p. 280, and <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Louisiana, post, </em>p. 325. The suggestion that a jury's verdict of acquittal could be overturned and a defendant retried would run afoul of the Sixth Amendment jury-trial guarantee and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In the federal system it also would be unconstitutional to prohibit a President from deciding, as an act of executive clemency, to reprieve one sentenced to death. U. S. Const., Art. II, § 2.</p>

<p id="b225-5"> In light of the limited grant of certiorari, see <em>supra, </em>at 162, we review the “vagueness” and “overbreadth” of the statutory aggravating circumstances only to consider whether their imprecision renders this capital-sentencing system invalid under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it is incapable of imposing capital punishment other than by arbitrariness or caprice.</p>

<p id="b225-7"> Two other reported cases indicate that juries have found aggravating circumstances based on § 27-2534.1 (b) (7). In both cases a separate statutory aggravating circumstance was also found, and the Supreme Court of Georgia did not explicitly rely on the finding of the seventh circumstance when it upheld the death sentence.

<p id="b226-6"> The petitioner also attacks § 25-2534.1 (b) (7) as vague. As we have noted in answering his overbreadth argument concerning this section, however, the state court has not given a broad reading to the scope of this provision, and there is no reason to think that juries will not be able to understand it. See n. 51, <em>supra; Proffitt </em>v. <em>Florida, post, </em>at 255-256.</p>

<p id="b227-7"> The petitioner also objects to the last part of § 27-2534.1 (b) (3) which requires that the great risk be created “by means of a weapon or device which would normally be hazardous to the lives of more than one person.” While the state court has not focused on this section, it seems reasonable to assume that if a great risk in fact is created, it will be likely that a weapon or device normally hazardous to more than one person will have created it.</p>

<p id="b228-7"> The court is required to specify in its opinion the similar cases which it took into consideration. § 27-2537 (e) (Supp. 1975). Special provision is made for staff to enable the court to compile data relevant to its consideration of the sentence’s validity. §§ 27-2537 (f)-(h) (Supp. 1975). See generally <em>supra, </em>at 166-168.</p>
<p id="b228-8">The petitioner claims that this procedure has resulted in an inadequate basis for measuring the proportionality of sentences. First, he notes that nonappealed capital convictions where a life sentence is imposed and cases involving homicides where a capital conviction is not obtained are not included in the group of cases which the Supreme Court of Georgia uses for comparative purposes. The Georgia court has the authoritjr to consider such cases, see <em>Ross </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1323586"><a href="/opinion/1323586/ross-v-state/#365" aria-description="Citation for case: Ross v.

E. 2d 356, 359</a></span> (1974), and it does consider appealed murder cases where a life sentence has been imposed. We do not think that the petitioner’s argument establishes that the Georgia court’s review process is ineffective. The petitioner further complains about the Georgia court’s current practice of using some <em>pre-Furman </em>cases in its comparative examination. This prac<page-number citation-index="1" label="205">*205</page-number>tice was necessary at the inception of the new procedure in the absence of any post <em>-Furman </em>capital cases available for comparison. It is not unconstitutional.</p>
