**Combined Opinion**
 At every stage of this lawsuit, Lear has sought to prove that, despite the grant of a patent *656 by the Patent Office, none of Adkins' improvements were sufficiently novel to warrant the award of a monopoly under the standards delineated in the governing federal statutes.  Moreover, the company has sought to prove that Adkins obtained his patent by means of a fraud on the Patent Office.  In response, the inventor has argued that since Lear had entered into a licensing agreement with Adkins, it was obliged to pay the agreed royalties regardless of the validity of the underlying patent.  The Supreme Court of California unanimously vindicated the inventor's position.  While the court recognized that generally a manufacturer is free to challenge the validity of an inventor's patent, it held that "one of the oldest doctrines in the field of patent law establishes that so long as a licensee is operating under a license agreement he is estopped to deny the validity of his licensor's patent in a suit for royalties under the agreement.  The theory underlying this doctrine is that a licensee should not be permitted to enjoy the benefit afforded by the agreement while simultaneously urging that the patent which forms the basis of the agreement is void." <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d 882, 891</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d 321, 325-326</citedDecision> (1967).  Almost 20 years ago, in its last consideration of the doctrine, this Court also invoked an estoppel to deny a licensee the right to prove that his licensor was demanding royalties for the use of an idea which was in reality a part of the public domain.  Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 339 U. S. 827, 836 (1950).  We granted certiorari in the present case, 391 U. S. 912 , to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule in the light of our recent decisions emphasizing the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection.  Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225 (1964); Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U. S. 234 (1964).  *657 I.  At the very beginning of the parties' relationship, Lear and Adkins entered into a rudimentary one-page agreement which provided that although "[a]ll new ideas, discoveries, inventions, etc., related to .

 52 Cal. Rptr. 795 , 806.  So far as pre-1959 royalties were concerned, the court held that the contract required the company to pay royalties on both the California and Michigan gyros regardless of the validity of the inventor's patent.  52 Cal. Rptr., at 809.  Once again both sides appealed, this time to the California Supreme Court, which took yet another approach to the problem presented.  The court rejected the District Court of Appeal's conclusion that the 1955 license gave Lear the right to terminate its royalty obligations in 1959.  Since the 1955 agreement was still in effect, the court concluded, relying on the language we have already quoted, that the doctrine of estoppel barred Lear from questioning the propriety of the Patent Office's grant.  <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 907</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 336</citedDecision> .  The court's adherence to estoppel, however, was not without qualification.  After noting Lear's claim that it had developed its Michigan gyros independently, the court tested this contention by considering "whether what is being built by Lear [in Michigan] springs entirely " (emphasis supplied) from the prior art. <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 913</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 340</citedDecision> .  Applying this test, it found that Lear had in fact "utilized the apparatus patented by Adkins throughout the period in question," <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 915</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 341</citedDecision> , and reinstated the jury's $888,000 verdict on this branch of the case. II.  Since the California Supreme Court's construction of the 1955 licensing agreement is solely a matter of state *662 law, the only issue open to us is raised by the court's reliance upon the doctrine of estoppel to bar Lear from proving that Adkins' ideas were dedicated to the common welfare by federal law. [10] In considering the propriety of the State Court's decision, we are well aware that we are not writing upon a clean slate.  The doctrine of estoppel has been considered by this Court in a line of cases reaching back into the middle of the 19th century.  Before deciding what the role of estoppel *663 should be in the present case and in the future, it is, then, desirable to consider the role it has played in the past.  A. While the roots of the doctrine have often been celebrated in tradition, we have found only one 19th century case in this Court that invoked estoppel in a considered manner.  And that case was decided before the Sherman Act made it clear that the grant of monopoly power to a patent owner constituted a limited exception to the general federal policy favoring free competition.  Kinsman v. Parkhurst, 18 How. 289 (1856).
**Combined Opinion**
 The California Supreme Court did not address itself to this issue with precision, for it believed that the venerable doctrine of estoppel provided a sufficient answer to all of Lear's claims based upon federal patent law. Thus, we do not know whether the Supreme Court would have awarded Adkins recovery even on his pre-patent royalties if it had recognized that previously established estoppel doctrine could no longer be properly invoked *675 with regard to royalties accruing during the 17-year patent period.  Our decision today will, of course, require the state courts to reconsider the theoretical basis of their decisions enforcing the contractual rights of inventors and it is impossible to predict the extent to which this re-evaluation may revolutionize the law of any particular State in this regard.  Consequently, we have concluded, after much consideration, that even though an important question of federal law underlies this phase of the controversy, we should not now attempt to define in even a limited way the extent, if any, to which the States may properly act to enforce the contractual rights of inventors of unpatented secret ideas.  Given the difficulty and importance of this task, it should be undertaken only after the state courts have, after fully focused inquiry, determined the extent to which they will respect the contractual rights of such inventors in the future.  Indeed, on remand, the California courts may well reconcile the competing demands of patent and contract law in a way which would not warrant further review in this Court. IV. We also find it inappropriate to pass at this time upon Lear's contention that Adkins' patent is invalid.  Not only did Lear fail to raise this issue in its petition for certiorari, but the California Supreme Court has yet to pass on the question of patent validity in that clear and unequivocal manner which is so necessary for proper adjudication in this Court. As we have indicated, the California Supreme Court considered the novelty of Adkins' ideas relevant to its decision at only one stage of its extensive analysis.  Since Lear claimed that it had developed its Michigan gyros completely independently of Adkins' efforts, the Supreme Court believed itself obliged to consider whether Adkins' ideas were not "entirely" anticipated by the prior art. <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 913</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 340</citedDecision> .  Applying *676 this test, the court upheld the jury's verdict of $888,000 on the Michigan gyros, finding that "Lear utilized the apparatus patented by Adkins throughout the period in question." <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 915</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 341</citedDecision> .  In reaching this conclusion, however, the court did express its belief that Adkins' invention made a "significant step forward" in the art of gyroscopy.  <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 915</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 341</citedDecision> .  It is far from clear that the court, in making this last statement, intended to hold that Adkins' ideas satisfied the demanding standard of invention explicated in our decision in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U. S. 1 (1966).  Surely, such a holding was not required by the court's analysis, which was concerned only with the question whether Lear had benefited from Adkins' ideas in any degree.  In this context, we believe that Lear must be required to address its arguments attacking the validity of the underlying patent to the California courts in the first instance.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

 In the first place, the question of validity has not been reached by the California Supreme Court, and when it is the patent may withstand attack.  In that event there will be no necessity to consider the impact of patent law on the enforceability of a contract grounded in state law. Second, even if the patent is declared invalid, the state court, after the parties have addressed themselves to the issues, may accommodate federal and state law in a matter which would not prompt review here.  Third, the parties themselves have neither briefed nor seriously argued the question in this Court, and we do not have the benefit of their views on what is surely a difficult question.  The Court itself has flushed the issue, which it now deals with on a piecemeal basis.  [2] Like the question of patent validity, I would leave the consequences of invalidity to the state court in the first instance.  NOTES [1]  Lear argues that this original agreement was not submitted in evidence at trial and so should not be considered a part of the record on appeal.  The California Supreme Court, however, treated the agreement as an important part of the record before it, <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 906</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 335</citedDecision> ; and so we are free to refer to it.

 The company argued, on the basis of federal as well as state cases, that a licensee may escape the impact of estoppel simply by announcing that it has repudiated the licensing agreement, regardless of the contract's terms.  See, e. g., Respondent's and Cross-Appellant's Opening Brief in Cases Nos. 28624 and 30089, at 110-111.  The California Supreme Court rejected this argument on its merits: "Lear relies on authorities holding that a licensee may terminate a license agreement upon notice to his licensor even though, prior to termination, there has been no adjudication of invalidity of the patent which is the subject of the agreement and that thereafter the licensee may challenge the validity of the patent.  (See, e. g., Armstrong Co. v. Shell Co. of Cal. (1929) 98 Cal. App. 769, 778-779 ).  This rule has no application if the agreement sets forth the particular circumstances under which termination must occur.  As stated above, such provisions must be complied with in order to effect a valid cancellation." <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 899</citedDecision> -900 n. 15, <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 331, n. 15</citedDecision> .  We clearly have jurisdiction to consider whether this decision is wrong.  In doing so, we have the duty to consider the broader implications of Lear's contention, and vindicate, if appropriate, its claim to relief on somewhat different grounds than it chose to advance below, especially when the California court recognized, in language we have already quoted, supra, at 656, that matters of basic principle are at stake.  [11]  There are two other early cases which enforced patent licenses without a thorough consideration of the estoppel issues that were presented.  In Eureka Co. v. Bailey Co., 11 Wall. 488 (1871), the Court held that a licensee was obliged to overcome a "very strong presumption" of patent validity in order to avoid his royalty obligations, without indicating how much more compelling a showing was required than was considered necessary in an ordinary infringement action.  In Dale Tile Manufacturing Co. v. Hyatt, 125 U. S. 46 (1888), this Court affirmed the decision of the New York state courts invoking the doctrine of licensee estoppel, on the ground that the estoppel question presented was one which involved only state law.
