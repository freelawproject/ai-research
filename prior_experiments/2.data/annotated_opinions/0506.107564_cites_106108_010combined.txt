The Government has maintained with equal vigor that it was not. [8] But this effort to decide whether or not a given "area," viewed in the abstract, is "constitutionally protected" deflects attention from the problem presented by this case. [9] For the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. See Lewis v. United States, 385 U. S. 206 , 210; United States v. Lee, 274 U. S. 559 , 563. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected. *352 See Rios v. United States, <targetCase>364 U. S. 253</targetCase> ; Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727 , 733. The Government stresses the fact that the telephone booth from which the petitioner made his calls was constructed partly of glass, so that he was as visible after he entered it as he would have been if he had remained outside. But what he sought to exclude when he entered the booth was not the intruding eyeÂ—it was the uninvited ear. He did not shed his right to do so simply because he made his calls from a place where he might be seen. No less than an individual in a business office, [10] in a friend's apartment, [11] or in a taxicab, [12] a person in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the Fourth Amendment. One who occupies it, shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world. To read the Constitution more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the public telephone has come to play in private communication.

Cf. Hester v. United States, supra . The critical fact in this case is that "[o]ne who occupies it, [a telephone booth] shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume" that his conversation is not being intercepted. Ante, at 352. The point is not that the booth is "accessible to the public" at other times, ante, at 351, but that it is a temporarily private place whose momentary occupants' expectations of freedom from intrusion are recognized as reasonable. Cf. Rios v. United States, <targetCase>364 U. S. 253</targetCase> . In Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505 , we held that eavesdropping accomplished by means of an electronic device that penetrated the premises occupied by petitioner was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. *362 That case established that interception of conversations reasonably intended to be private could constitute a "search and seizure," and that the examination or taking of physical property was not required. This view of the Fourth Amendment was followed in Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471 , at 485, and Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41 , at 51. Also compare Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323 , at 327. In Silverman we found it unnecessary to re-examine Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129 , which had held that electronic surveillance accomplished without the physical penetration of petitioner's premises by a tangible object did not violate the Fourth Amendment. This case requires us to reconsider Goldman, and I agree that it should now be overruled.

Sess.). Urging that the telephone booth should be excluded, the Government finds support in United States v. Borgese, 235 F. Supp. 286 . [9] It is true that this Court has occasionally described its conclusions in terms of "constitutionally protected areas," see, e. g., Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505 , 510, 512; Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427 , 438-439; Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41 , 57, 59, but we have never suggested that this concept can serve as a talismanic solution to every Fourth Amendment problem. [10] Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385 . [11] Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257 . [12] Rios v. United States, <targetCase>364 U. S. 253</targetCase> . [13] See Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 , 464-466. We do not deal in this case with the law of detention or arrest under the Fourth Amendment. [14] Based upon their previous visual observations of the petitioner, the agents correctly predicted that he would use the telephone booth for several minutes at approximately the same time each morning. The petitioner was subjected to electronic surveillance only during this predetermined period. Six recordings, averaging some three minutes each, were obtained and admitted in evidence. They preserved the petitioner's end of conversations concerning the placing of bets and the receipt of wagering information.

Nor do the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure impose an inflexible requirement of prior notice. Rule 41 (d) does require federal officers to serve upon the person searched a copy of the warrant and a receipt describing the material obtained, but it does not invariably require that this be done before the search takes place. Nordelli v. United States, 24 F. 2d 665 , 666-667. Thus the fact that the petitioner in Osborn was unaware that his words were being electronically transcribed did not prevent this Court from sustaining his conviction, and did not prevent the Court in Berger from reaching the conclusion that the use of the recording device sanctioned in Osborn was entirely lawful. 388 U. S. 41 , 57. [17] Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427 , 464 (dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN). [18] See, e. g., Jones v. United States, 357 U. S. 493 , 497-499; Rios v. United States, <targetCase>364 U. S. 253</targetCase> , 261; Chapman v. United States, 365 U. S. 610 , 613-615; Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483 , 486-487. [19] See, e. g., Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 , 153, 156; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 , 454-456; Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160 , 174-177; Cooper v. California, 386 U. S. 58 ; Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 , 298-300. [20] In Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20 , 30, the Court stated: "The right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by which it was committed, as well as weapons and other things to effect an escape from custody, is not to be doubted." Whatever one's view of "the long-standing practice of searching for other proofs of guilt within the control of the accused found upon arrest," United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 , 61; cf. id., at 71-79 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter), the concept of an "incidental" search cannot readily be extended to include surreptitious surveillance of an individual either immediately before, or immediately after, his arrest. [21] Although "[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others," Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 , 298-299, there seems little likelihood that electronic surveillance would be a realistic possibility in a situation so fraught with urgency. [22] A search to which an individual consents meets Fourth Amendment requirements, Zap v. United States, 328 U. S. 624 , but of course "the usefulness of electronic surveillance depends on lack of notice to the suspect."
