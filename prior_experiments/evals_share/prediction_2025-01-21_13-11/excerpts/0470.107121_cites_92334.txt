Case of interest: Ex Parte Terry (1888)
-----------------------
 guilty of criminal contempt, imposing a sentence of one year's imprisonment.[1] The Court of Appeals *164 affirmed, 334 F.2d 460. We granted certiorari, 379 U.S. 944.
Rule 42 (a) is entitled "Summary Disposition" and reads as follows:
"A criminal contempt may be punished summarily if the judge certified that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court. The order of contempt shall recite the facts and shall be signed by the judge and entered of record."
Rule 42 (a) was reserved "for exceptional circumstances," Brown v. United States, 359 U.S. 41, 54 (dissenting opinion), such as acts threatening the judge or disrupting a hearing or obstructing court proceedings. Ibid. We reach that conclusion in light of "the concern long demonstrated by both Congress and this Court over the possible abuse of the contempt power," ibid., and in light of the wording of the Rule. Summary contempt is for "misbehavior" (Ex parte Terry, <caseOfInterest>128 U.S. 289</caseOfInterest>, 314) in the "actual presence of the court." Then speedy punishment may be necessary in order to achieve "summary vindication of the court's dignity and authority." Cooke v. United States, 267 U.S. 517, 534. But swiftness was not a prerequisite of justice here. Delay necessary for a hearing would not imperil the grand jury proceedings.
Cases of the kind involved here are foreign to Rule 42 (a). The real contempt, if such there was, was contempt before the grand juryÂ—the refusal to answer to it when directed by the court. Swearing the witness and repeating the questions before the judge was an effort to have the refusal to testify "committed in the actual presence of the court" for the purposes of Rule *165 42 (a). It served no other purpose, for the witness had been adamant and had made his position known. The appearance before the District Court was not a new and different proceeding, unrelated to the other. It was ancillary to the grand jury hearing and designed as an aid to it. Eve

 them and consider them with my client and to look up the law.
"I further request, your Honor, a hearing where I will be permitted to call witnesses, perhaps a grand juror or two or more; perhaps the places the phone calls allegedly were made as indicated by the assistant, to prove to your Honor that there could be no possible violation of the Communications Act.
"I have not been told what tariff has been violated; no law has been cited or rule or regulation to your Honor or to me, and that requires research.
"I also would request that the contempt hearing be held in public.
"The Court: Your request is denied. This is a contempt committed in open court, and I adjudge the defendant guilty of a criminal contempt rule under Rule 42 (a)."

[3]  Rule 42 (a) was described by the Advisory Committee as "substantially a restatement of existing law. Ex parte Terry, <caseOfInterest>128 U.S. 289</caseOfInterest>; Cooke v. United States . . . ." We have confirmed this on more than one occasion, e. g., Offutt v. United States. 348 U.S. 11, 13-14; Brown v. United States, supra, at 51.
[4]  Chief Justice Taft said in Cooke v. United States, supra, at 537:

"Due process of law, therefore, in the prosecution of contempt, except of that committed in open court, requires that the accused should be advised of the charges and have a reasonable opportunity to meet them by way of defense or explanation. We think this includes the assistance of counsel, if requested, and the right to call witnesses to give testimony, relevant either to the issue of complete exculpation or in extenuation of the offense and in mitigation of the penalty to be imposed."
[5]  In more than one instance in the Southern District of New York, from which this case comes, witnesses cited for testimonial contempt before the grand jury were given hearings under Rule 42 (b). E. g., United States v. Castaldi, 338 F.2d 883; United States
