 The Court has long taken the view that the United States has no right of *85 appeal in a criminal case, absent explicit statutory authority.  United States v. Sanges, 144 U. S. 310 (1892).  Such authority was not provided until the enactment of the Criminal Appeals Act, Act of Mar. 2, 1907, ch. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 , which permitted the United States to seek a writ of error in this Court from any decision dismissing an indictment on the basis of “the invalidity, or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded.” Our consideration of Government appeals over the ensuing years ordinarily focused upon the intricacies of the Act and its amendments.  1 In 1971, however, Congress adopted the current language of the Act, permitting Government appeals from any decision dismissing an indictment, “except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.” 18 U. S. C. §3731 (1976 ed.).  Soon thereafter, this Court remarked in .a footnote., with more optimism than prescience that “[t]he end of our problems with this Act is finally in sight.” United States v. Weller, 401 U. S. 254 , 255 n. 1 (1971).  For in fact the 1971 amendment did not end the debate over appeals by the Government in'', criminal cases; it simply shifted the focus of the debate from j issues of statutory construction to issues as to the scope and J meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  • > In our first encounter with the new statute, we concluded that “Congress intended to remove all statutory, barriers to Government appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit.” United States v. Wilson, <citedDecision>420 U. S. 332, 337</citedDecision> (1975).  Since up to that point Government appeals had been subject to statutory restrictions independent of the Double Jeopardy Clause, our previous cases construing the statute proved to be of little assistance in determining when the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment would *86 prohibit further prosecution.  A detailed canvass of the history of the double jeopardy principles in English and American law led us to conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause was primarily “directed at the threat of multiple prosecutions,” and posed no bar to Government appeals “where those appeals would not require a new trial.” <citedDecision>Id., at 342</citedDecision> .  We accordingly held in Jenkins, supra, at 370 , that, whether or not a dismissal of an indictment after jeopardy had attached amounted to an acquittal on the merits, the Government had no right to appeal, because “further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand.” 2 If Jenkins is a correct statement of the law, the judgment of the Court of Appeals relying on that decision, as it was bound to do, would in all likelihood have to be affirmed.  3 Yet, though our assessment of the history and meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause in Wilson, Jenkins, and Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377 (1975), occurred only three Terms ago, our vastly increased exposure to the various facets of the Double Jeopardy Clause has now convinced us that Jenkins *87 was wrongly decided.  It placed an unwarrantedly great emphasis on the defendant’s right to have his guilt decided by the first jury empaneled to try him so as to include those cases where the defendant himself seeks to terminate the trial before verdict on grounds unrelated to factual guilt or innocence.  We have therefore decided to overrule Jenkins , and thus to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case. II The origin and history of the Double Jeopardy Clause are hardly a matter of dispute.  See generally Wilson; supra, at 339-340; Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187-188 (1957); id., at 200 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  The constitutional provision had its origin in the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon.

 This truth is expressed in the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon, which lie at the core of the area protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  As we have recognized in cases from United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896), to Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54, a defendant once acquitted may not be again subjected to trial without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.  But that situation is obviously a far cry from the present case, where the Government was quite willing to continue with its production of evidence to show the defendant guilty before the jury first empaneled to try him, but the defendant elected to seek termination of the trial on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence.  This is scarcely a picture of an all-powerful state relentlessly pursuing a defendant who had either been found not guilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact.  It is instead a picture of a defendant who chooses to avoid conviction and imprisonment, not because of his assertion that the Government has failed to make out a case against him, but because of a legal claim that the Government’s case against him must fail even though it might satisfy the trier of fact that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  We have previously noted that “the trial judge’s characterization of his own action cannot control the classification of the action.” Jorn, 400 U. S., at 478 n. 7 (opinion of Harlan, J.), citing United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267, 290 (1970).  See also Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at 571 ; Wilson, <citedDecision>420 U. S., at 336</citedDecision> .  Despite respondent’s contentions, an appeal is not barred simply because a ruling in favor of a defendant “is based upon facts outside the face of the indictment,” <citedDecision>id., at 348</citedDecision> , or be *97 cause it “is granted on the ground .  .  .  that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged,” Lee, 432 U. S., at 30 .  Rather, a defendant is acquitted only when “the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in the defendant's favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.” Martin Linen, supra, at 571 .  Where the court, before the' jury returns a verdict, enters a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29, appeal will, be barred, only when “it is plain that the District Court .  .

 The Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function.” Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406-408 (1932) (dissenting opinion).  Here, “the lessons of experience” indicate that Government appeals from midtrial dismissals requested by the defendant would significantly advance the public interest in assuring that each defendant shall be subject to a just judgment on the merits of his case, without “enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.” Green, 355 U. S., at 188 .  Accordingly, the contrary holding of United States v. Jenkins is overruled.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.  It is so ordered.  A thorough account of the enactment and development of the Act is set out in Mr. Justice Harlan’s opinion for the Court in United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267, 291-296 (1970).  The rule established in <citedDecision>Wilson</citedDecision> and Jenkins was later described in the following terms: “[Dismissals (as opposed to mistrials) if they occurred at a stage of the proceeding after which jeopardy had attached, but prior to the factfinder’s conclusion as to guilt or innocence, were final so far as the accused defendant was concerned and could not be appealed by the Government because retrial was barred by double jeopardy.  This made the issue of double jeopardy turn very largely on temporal considerations — if the Court granted an order of dismissal during the factfinding stage of the proceedings, the defendant could not be reprosecuted, but if the dismissal came later, he could.” Lee v. United, States, 432 U. S. 23, 36 (1977) (RehN-qtjist, J., concurring).  The Government contends here that the District Court in Jenkins entered a judgment of acquittal in favor of Jenkins, but our opinion in that case recognized that it could not be said with certainty whether this was the case. See Jenkins, 420 U. S., at 367 .  Two years later, review was provided for all "infamous” crimes.  Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, § 5, 26 Stat. 827 .  The Court thereby rejected the English rule set out in Vaux’s Case, 4 Co. Rep. 44a, 76 Eng. Rep. 992 (K. B. 1590), which refused to recognize a plea of autrefois acquit where the initial indictment had been insufficient to support a conviction.  Again, this ruling provided a greater measure of protection for criminal defendants than had been known at the time of the *89 adoption of the Constitution.

 In other circumstances, this Court has had no difficulty in distinguishing between those rulings which relate to “the ultimate question of guilt or innocence” and those which serve other purposes.  Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 490 (1976).  We reject the contrary implication of the dissent that this Court or other courts are incapable of distinguishing between the latter and the former.  The original jury in that case had found the defendant guilty of second-degree murder, but did not find him guilty of first-degree murder.  The Court held that his appeal did not waive his objection to a second prosecution for firsydegree murder, but it was careful to reaffirm the holding of United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896), that “a defendant can be tried a second time for an offense when his prior conviction for that same offense [has] been set aside on appeal.” 355 U. S., at 189 .  We should point out that it is entirely possible for a trial court to reconcile the public interest in the Government’s right to appeal from an erroneous conclusion of law with the defendant’s interest in avoiding a second prosecution.  In United States v. Wilson, <citedDecision>420 U. S. 332</citedDecision> (1975), the court permitted the case to go to the jury, which returned a verdict of guilty, but it subsequently dismissed the indictment for preindictment delay on the basis of evidence adduced at trial. Most recently in United States v. Ceccolini, 435 U. S. 268 (1978), we described similar action with approval: “The District Court had sensibly first made its finding on the factual question of guilt or innocence, and then ruled on the motion to suppress; a reversal of these rulings would require no further proceedings in the District Court, but merely a reinstatement of the finding of guilt.” Id., at 271 .  Accord, United States v. Kopp, 429 U. S. 121 (1976); United States v. Rose, 429 U. S. 5 (1976); United States v. Morrison, 429 U. S. 1 (1976).  We, of course, do not suggest that a midtrial dismissal of a prosecution, in response to a defense motion on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence, is necessarily improper.  Such rulings may be necessary to terminate proceedings marred by fundamental error.  But where a defendant prevails on such a motion, he takes the risk that an appellate court will reverse the trial court.
