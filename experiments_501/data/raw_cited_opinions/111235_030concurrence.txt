<p id="b62-6">I join the opinion and judgment of the Court. I write separately only to make clear that I continue to adhere to the views expressed in my concurring opinion in <em>Hankerson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>432 U. S. 233, 246-248 (1977).</p>
<p id="b62-7">In <em>Hankerson, </em>I agreed with the Court that the new constitutional rule announced in <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U. S. 684 (1975), should apply retroactively to cases on direct review. • In this case, the rule of <em>Mullaney </em>has been applied retroactively on collateral review. For the reasons stated by Justice Harlan in <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U. S. 667, 675-702 (1971) (separate opinion), I would apply new constitutional rules retroactively on collateral review only in exceptional cases. See <em>Hankerson, supra, </em>at 247-248 (Powell, J., concurring). The State, however, has not challenged the retroactive application of <em>Mullaney </em>in this case. Thus, the issue whether that retroactive application is proper has not been presented to this Court.</p>
<p id="b62-8">Assuming, as we must, that <em>Mullaney </em>may be applied retroactively in this case, and for the reasons set forth in the Court’s opinion today, I agree that Ross has shown “cause” for failing to raise his constitutional claim in a timely fashion.</p>
