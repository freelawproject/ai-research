**Combined Opinion**
. . the case is one for the consideration of the Court of Appeals . . . ." Price v. State, 224 Ga. 306 , 307, 161 S.E.2d 825 , 826 (1968). The Georgia Court of Appeals then heard the appeal and affirmed the second conviction, rejecting petitioner's argument, among others, that his retrial for murder constituted double jeopardy. Price v. State, 118 Ga. App. 207 , 163 S.E.2d 243 (1968). The Court of Appeals held that in Brantley v. State, 132 Ga. 573 , 64 S.E. 676 (1909), aff'd, 217 U.S. 284 (1910), the Georgia Supreme Court had decided this question adversely to petitioner. The Court of Appeals then quoted from the Brantley case's syllabus: "When a person has been indicted for murder and convicted of voluntary manslaughter, if he voluntarily seeks and obtains a new trial, he is subject to another trial generally for the offense charged in the indictment, and upon such trial he cannot successfully interpose a plea of former acquittal of the crime of murder, or former jeopardy in regard thereto." 118 Ga. App. , at 208 , 163 S. E. 2d, at 244.
