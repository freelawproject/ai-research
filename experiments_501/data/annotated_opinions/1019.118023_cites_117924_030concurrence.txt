 Both parties agree that the first two prongs of the Central Hudson test are met. Even if we assume, arguendo, that Rhode Island’s regulation also satisfies the requirement that it directly advance the governmental'interest, Rhode Island’s regulation fails the final prong; that is, its ban is more extensive than necessary to serve the State’s interest.  As we^ have explained, in order for a speech restriction to pass muster under the final prong, there must be a fit between the legislature’s goal and method, “a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served.” Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).  While the State need not employ the least restrictive means to accomplish its goal, the fit between means and ends must be “narrowly tailored.” Ibid. The scope of the restriction on speech must be reasonably,, though it need not be perfectly, targeted to address the harm, intended to be regulated.  See Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 632-634 (1995).  The State’s regulation must indicate a “carefu[l] calculation of J the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by its prohibition.” Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 417 (1993) (internal quotation, marks omitted).  The availability of less burdensome, alternatives to reach the stated goal signals that the fit between the legislature’s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends may be too imprecise to withstand First Amendment scrutiny.  See Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., <citedDecision>514 U. S. 476, 486-487</citedDecision> (1995); Cincinnati, supra, at 417, n. 13 .  If alternative channels permit communication of the restricted speech, the regulation is *530 more likely to be considered reasonable.  See Florida Bar, supra, at 632-634 .  Rhode Island offers one, and only one, justification for its ban on price advertising.  Rhode Island says that the ban is intended to keep alcohol prices high as a way to keep consumption low. By preventing sellers from informing customers of prices, the regulation prevents competition from driving prices down and requires consumers to spend more time to find the best price for alcohol.  Brief for Respondent State of Rhode Island 22.  The higher cost of obtaining alcohol, Rhode Island argues, will lead to reduced consumption.

 Nothing in the Amendment’s text or history justifies its use to alter the application of the First Amendment.  “[0]ur prior cases have made clear that the [Twenty-first] Amend *533 ment does not license the States to ignore their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution.” Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 712 (1984).  See also Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116, 122, n. 5 (1982) (“The State may not exercise its power under the Twenty-first Amendment in a way which impinges upon the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment”); Craig, supra, at 206 (“Neither the text nor the history of the Twenty-first Amendment suggests that it qualifies individual rights protected by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment where the sale or use of liquor is concerned” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The Twenty-first Amendment does not trump First Amendment rights or add a presumption of validity to a regulation that cannot otherwise satisfy First Amendment requirements.  The Court of Appeals relied on California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109, 118-119 (1972), for its determination that the Twenty-first Amendment provided an “added presumption” of the regulation’s validity.  There, this Court upheld a State’s regulations prohibiting establishments licensed to sell liquor by the drink from offering explicitly sexual entertainment.  As we recently explained in Coors, “LaRue did not involve commercial speech about alcohol, but instead concerned the regulation of nude dancing in places where alcohol was served.” <citedDecision>514 U. S., at 483, n. 2</citedDecision> .  The cases following LaRue similarly involved the regulation of nude or nearly nude dancing in establishments licensed to serve alcohol.  New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U. S. 714 (1981) (per curiam); Newport v. Iacobucci, 479 U. S. 92 (1986) (per curiam).  Nothing in LaRue suggested that the Twenty-first Amendment would permit a State to prohibit the kind of speech at issue here, and as discussed above, the text and history of the Twenty-first Amendment clearly indicate that the Amendment was not intended to supplant the general application of constitutional provisions, except for its limited exception to the Commerce Clause’s normal *534 operation.  Indeed, LaRue notes that prior decisions “did not go so far as to hold or say that the Twenty-first Amendment supersedes all other provisions of the United States Constitution in the area of liquor regulations,” 409 U. S., at 115 , and LaRue certainly does not stand for that proposition.  The Court of Appeals’ reliance on LaRue was misplaced.  Rhode Island’s prohibition on alcohol-price advertising, as a means to keep alcohol prices high and consumption low, cannot survive First Amendment scrutiny.
