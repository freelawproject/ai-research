 Like these other doctrines, the question whether preindictment delay violates due process of law cannot ordinarily be considered apart from the factual development at trial since normally only the “ ‘[e] vents of the trial [can demonstrate] actual prejudice.’ ” United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783, 789 (1977), quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 326 (1971); see United States v. MacDonald, 435 U. S. 850, 858, 858-859 (1978).  Here, therefore, the District Court, quite properly, deferred consideration of the respondent’s pretrial motion to dismiss for preaccusation delay until trial. At the close of the evidence, respondent renewed his motion.  The District Court recognized that there was sufficient evidence of guilt to permit submission of count one to the jury, but granted the motion as to this count because, evaluating the facts adduced at trial, the court found that the delay between the offense alleged and respondent’s indictment had been unjustifiable and had so prejudiced respondent’s ability to present his defense as to constitute a denial of due process of law. A critical feature of today’s holding appears to be the Court’s definition of acquittal as “ 'a resolution [in the defendant’s favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,’ ” ante, at 97, quoting United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S., at 571 .  But this definition, which is narrower than the traditional one, enjoys no significant support in our prior decisions.  The language quoted from Martin Linen Supply Co. was tied to the par *112 ticular issue in that case and was never intended to serve as an all-encompassing definition of acquittal for all purposes.  Rather, Martin Linen Supply referred generally to “acquittal” as “a legal determination on the basis of facts adduced at the trial relating to the general issue of the case,” id., at 575 (citations omitted), and this is the accepted definition.  See Serfass v. United States, <citedDecision>420 U. S. 377, 393</citedDecision> (1975), quoting United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267 , 290 n. 19 (1970).  This definition, moreover, clearly encompasses rulings pertaining to all “affirmative defenses” that depend on the factual development at trial. The traditional definition of “acquittal” obviously is responsive to the values protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  While it perhaps might not be objectionable to permit retrial of a defendant whose first trial was terminated on the basis of a midtrial ruling on a motion that could— because it did not depend upon the facts adduced at trial — have been raised before jeopardy attached, see <citedDecision>Serfass</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 394, 8 it would be intolerable to permit, the retrial of a defendant whose first prosecution ended on the basis of a ruling — like the one in the present case — which could only be made after the factual development at trial. Notably, the Court neither explains why it chooses to reject the more traditional definition of “acquittal” nor attempts to justify its more restrictive definition in terms of the constitutional policy against multiple trials.  But I will not dwell further on this point.. As the Court opinion itself demonstrates, what is perhaps as important as the actual definition is how it is applied.  The pertinent question, thus, is one the Court never addresses: Why, for pur *113 poses of its new definition of “acquittal,” is not the fact vel non of preindictment delay one of the “factual elements of the offense charged”?  The Court plainly cannot answer that preindictment delay is not referred to in the statutory definition of the offense charged in count one, cf. Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977), for it states that dismissals based on the defenses of insanity 9 and entrapment — neither of which is bound up with the statutory definition of federal crimes — will constitute “acquittals.” Ante, at 97-98.  How can decisions based on the trial evidence that a defendant is “not guilty by reason of insanity” or “not guilty by reason of entrapment” erect a double jeopardy bar, and a decision — equally based on evaluation of the trial evidence— that the defendant is “not guilty by reason of preaccusation delay” not also prohibit further prosecution?  None of these defenses is bound up in the definition of a crime, and the availability of each depends on the factual development at trial. More fundamentally, to permit a retrial following an appellate court’s reversal of a judgment entered on any of these grounds presents all the evils the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to prevent.  The Court offers no satisfactory explanation for the difference in treatment.

 See Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 , 504 n. 14 (1978), quoting Carsey v. United States, 129 U. S. App. D. C. 205, 208-209, 392 F. 2d 810, 813-814 (1967).  By “final judgment favorable to the accused,” I am, of course, referring to an order terminating all prosecution of the defendant on the ground he “simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged.” See Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, 30 (1977).  Similarly unpersuasive is the Court’s suggestion that its holding is supported by the well-recognized rules that a criminal defendant may twice be tried for the same offense if he either successfully moved for a mistrial at the first trial, see Lee, supra; United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600 (1976), or succeeded in having a conviction set aside on a ground other than the insufficiency of the evidence.  See United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896).  What distinguishes these situations, of course, is that neither involved a final judgment entered for the accused, and that in both the Government could not be said to have had a complete opportunity to convict the accused.  The Court’s suggestion that intervening decisions have somehow undermined Jenkins simply will not wash. Although it is quite true that the author of the Court opinion has stated that he understood Jenkins to embrace a rule that any midtrial termination that is labeled a “dismissal” erects a double jeopardy bar, see ante, at 86 n. 2, quoting Lee, 432 U. S., at 36 (Rehnqtjist, J., concurring), no Court opinion has adopted the position that the label attached to a trial court’s ruling could be determinative.  Indeed, since <citedDecision>Serfass</citedDecision> v. United States, 420 U. S 377, 392 (1975), which was decided the week after Jenkins , explicitly provides that labels are not to have such talismanic significance, the unanimous Court in Jenkins could scarcely have contemplated that it had announced such a mechanical formula.  Thus, the Court’s suggestion, see ante, at 94, that Lee , which held that a termination that was labeled a “dismissal” did not erect a double jeopardy bar, could have undermined Jenkins is unpersuasive on its face.  In Lee , we treated the dismissal as the equivalent of a mistrial because both the trial judge and the parties had so regarded it.  See 432 U. S., at 29.  In <citedDecision>Serfass</citedDecision> , we reserved decision on the question whether a defendant who was afforded an opportunity to obtain a determination of a legal defense prior to trial but who nevertheless knowingly allowed himself to be placed in jeopardy before raising the defense could claim the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  420 U. S., at 394.  A contrary position would not only be inconsistent with Burks v. United States, ante, p. 1, but would also have untoward consequences for criminal defendants.  The premise of such a ruling would necessarily be that a criminal defendant has no legitimate interest in protecting the finality of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.  It would then follow that there could be appellate review not only of all directed verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity, but also of all jury verdicts that had been preceded by a prior finding of guilt of the statutory offense.  The implications of such a holding would be particularly significant in jurisdictions providing for bifurcated determinations of guilt and sanity.  In any ease in which the date upon which the defendant committed the crime is disputed and may have been outside the statute of limitations provided by law, a trial judge could, and probably would, submit this question to the jury along with the general issue.
