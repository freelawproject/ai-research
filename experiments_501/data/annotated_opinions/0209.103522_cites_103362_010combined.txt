**Combined Opinion**
 Cf. Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511 ; Mayflower Farms v. Ten Eyck, 297 U. S. 266 .  In 1937 Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, 261 U. S. 525 , was overruled and a statute of'Washington which authorized the fixing of minimum wages for women and minors was sustained.  West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 .  In the same year, Townsend v. Yeomans, 301 U. S. 441 , upheld a *245 Georgia statute fixing maximum warehouse charges for the handling and selling of leaf tobacco.. Cf. Mulford v. Smith, 307 U. S. 38 ; Currin v. Wallace, 306 U. S. 1 .  The power of Congress under the commerce clause to authorize the fixing of minimum prices for milk was upheld in United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, 307 U. S. 533 , decided in 1939.  The next year the price-fixing provisions of the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937 were sustained.  Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins, <citedDecision>310 U. S. 381</citedDecision> .  And 'at this term we upheld the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.  United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 .  These cases represent more than scattered examples of constitutionally permissible price-fixing schemes.  They represent in large measure a basic departure from the philosophy and approach of the majority in the Ribnik case. The standard there Employed, following that used in Tyson & Brother v. Banton, 273 U. S. 418 , 430 et seq., was that the constitutional validity of price-fixing legislation, at least in absence of a so-called emergency, 6 was dependent on whether or not the business in question was “affected with a.public interest.” Cf. Brazee v. Michigan, 241 U. S. 340 .  It was said to be so affected if it had been “devoted to the public .use” and if “an interest in effect” had been granted “to the public in that use.” Ribnik v. McBride, supra, p. 355 .  That test, labelled by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent in the Tyson case (273 U. S. at p. 446) as “little more than a fiction,” was discarded in Nebbia v. New York, supra, pp. 531-539.
