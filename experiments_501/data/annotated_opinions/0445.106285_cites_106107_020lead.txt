 It said: “[W]e have no hesitation in saying that were a State affirmatively to sanction such police incursion into privacy it would run counter to the guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment.” At p. 28.  Nevertheless, after declaring that the “security of one’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police” is “implicit in 'the concept of ordered liberty’ and as such enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause,” cf. Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 (1937), and announcing that it “stoutly adhere [d]” to the Weeks decision, the Court decided that the Weeks exclusionary rule would not then be imposed upon the States as “an essential ingredient of the right.” 338 U. S., at 27-29 .  The Court’s reasons for not considering essential to the *651 right to privacy, as a curb imposed upon the States by the Due Process Clause, that which decades before had been posited as part and parcel of the Fourth Amendment’s limitation upon federal encroachment of individual privacy, were bottomed on factual considerations.  While they are not basically relevant to a decision that the exclusionary rule is an essential ingredient of the Fourth Amendment as the right it embodies is vouchsafed against the States by the Due Process Clause, we will consider the current validity of the factual grounds upon which Wolf was based.  The Court in Wolf first stated that “[t]he contrariety of views of the States” on the adoption of the exclusionary rule of Weeks was “particularly impressive” (at p. 29) ; and, in this connection, that it could not “brush aside the experience of States which deem the incidence of such conduct by the police too slight to call for a deterrent remedy ... by overriding the [States’] relevant rules of evidence.” At pp. 31-32.  While in 1949, prior to the Wolf case, almost two-thirds of the States were opposed to the use of the exclusionary rule, now, despite the Wolf case, more than half of those since passing upon it, by their own legislative or judicial decision, have wholly or partly adopted or adhered to the Weeks rule.  See Elkins v. United States, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 206</citedDecision> , Appendix, pp. 224-232 (1960).  Significantly, among those now following the rule is California, which, according to its highest court, was “compelled to reach tha(t conclusion because other remedies have completely failed to secure compliance with the constitutional provisions .  .  .  .” People v. Cohan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445 , 282 P. 2d 905, 911 (1955).  In connection with this California case, we note that the second basis elaborated in Wolf in support of its failure to enforce the exclusionary doctrine against the States was that “other means of protection” have been afforded “the *652 right to privacy.” 7 338 U. S., at 30 .  The experience of California that such other remedies have been worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other States.  The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been *653 recognized by this Court since Wolf .  See Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 137 (1954).  Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the “weighty testimony” of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13 , 150 N. E. 585 (1926).  There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the Weeks exclusionary rule in New York, had said that “[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax.” 242 N. Y., at 22 , 150 N. E., at 588 .  However, the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court. These include the recent discarding of the “silver platter” doctrine which allowed federal judicial use.  of evidence seized in violation of the Constitution by state agents, <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra; the relaxation of the formerly strict requirements as to standing to challenge the use of evidence thus seized, so that now the procedure of exclusion, “ultimately referable to constitutional safeguards;” is available to anyone even “legitimately on [the] premises” unlawfully searched, Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, 266-267 (1960); and, finally, the formulation of a method to prevent state use of evidence unconstitutionally seized by federal agents, Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 (1956).  Because there can be no fixed formula, we are admittedly met with “recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches,” but less is not to be expected when dealing with a Constitution, and, at any rate, “ [r] easonableness is in the first instance for the [trial court] ... to determine.” United States v. Rabinowits, 339 U. S. 56, 63 (1950).  It, therefore, plainly appears that the factual considerations supporting the failure of the Wolf Court to include the Weeks exclusionary rule when it recognized the enforceability of the right to privacy against the States in 1949, while not basically relevant to the constitutional consideration, could not, in any analysis, now be deemed controlling.  *654 III. Some five years after Wolf , in answer to a plea made here Term after Term that we overturn its doctrine on applicability of the Weeks exclusionary rule, this Court indicated that such should not be done until the States had “adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the [Weeks] rule.” Irvine v. California, supra, at 134 .  There again it was said: “Never until June of 1949 did this Court hold the basic search-and-seizure prohibition in any way applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Ibid. And only last Term, after again carefully re-examining the Wolf doctrine in <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, the Court pointed out that “the controlling principles” as to search and seizure and the problem of admissibility “seemed clear” (at p. 212) until the announcement in Wolf “that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not itself require state courts to adopt the exclusionary rule” of the Weeks case. At p. 213.  At the same time, the Court pointed out, “the underlying constitutional doctrine which Wolf established .  .  .  that the Federal Constitution .  .  .

 We hold that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, 'inadmissible in a state court. IV. Since the Fourth Amendment's right of privacy has been declared enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth, it is enforceable against them by the same sanction of exclusion as is used against the Federal Government.  Were it otherwise, then just as without the Weeks rule the assurance against unreasonable federal searches and seizures would be “a form of words,” valueless and undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of inestimable human liberties, so too, without that rule the freedom from state invasions of privacy would be so ephemeral and so neatly severed from its conceptual nexus with the freedom from all brutish means of coercing evidence as not to merit this Court’s high regard as a freedom “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” At the time that the Court held in Wolf that the Amendment was applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause, the cases of this Court, as we have seen, had steadfastly held that as.  to federal officers the Fourth Amendment included the exclusion of the evidence seized in violation of its provisions.  Even Wolf “stoutly adhered” to that proposition.  The right to privacy, when conceded operatively enforceable against the States, was not susceptible of destruction by avulsion of the sanction upon which its protection and enjoyment had always been deemed dependent under the Boyd, Weeks and Silverthorne cases. Therefore, in extending the substantive protections of due process to all constitutionally unreasonable searches — state or federal — it was *656 logically and constitutionally necessary that the exclusion doctrine — an essential part of the right to privacy — be also insisted upon as an essential ingredient of the right newly recognized by the Wolf case. In short, the admission of the new constitutional right by Wolf could not consistently tolerate denial of its most important constitutional privilege, namely, the exclusion of the evidence which an accused had been forced to give by reason of the unlawful seizure.  To hold otherwise is to grant the right but in reality to withhold its privilege and enjoyment.  Only last year the Court itself recognized that the purpose of the exclusionary rule “is to deter — to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way — by removing the incentive to disregard it.” <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 217.  Indeed, we are aware of no restraint, similar to that rejected today, conditioning the enforcement of any other basic constitutional right.  The right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and particularly reserved to the people, would stand in marked contrast to all other rights declared as “basic to a free society.” Wolf v. Colorado, supra, at 27 .  This Court has not hesitated to enforce as strictly against the States as it does against the Federal Government the rights of free speech and of a free press, the rights to notice and to a fair, public trial, including, as it does, the right not to be convicted by use of a coerced confession, however logically relevant it be, and without regard to its reliability.  Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534 (1961).  And nothing could be more certain than that when a coerced confession is involved, “the relevant rules of evidence” are overridden without regard to “the incidence of such conduct by the police,” slight or frequent.  Why should not the sanie rule apply to what is tantamount to coerced testimony by way of unconstitutional seizure of goods, papers, effects, documents, etc.?

 The philosophy of each Amendment and of each freedom is complementary to, although not dependent upon, that of the other in its sphere of influence — the very least that together they assure in either sphere is that no man is to be convicted on unconstitutional evidence.  Cf. Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 173 (1952).  Y. Moreover, our holding that the exclusionary rule is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments is not only the logical dictate of prior cases, but it also makes very good sense.  There is no war between the Constitution and common sense.  Presently, a federal prosecutor may make no use of evidence illegally seized, but a State’s attorney across the street may, although he supposedly is operating under the enforceable prohibitions of the same Amendment.  Thus the State, by admitting evidence unlawfully seized, serves to encourage disobedience to the Federal Constitution which it is bound to uphold.  Moreover, as was said in <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> , “[t'Jhe very essence of a healthy federalism depends upon the avoidance of needless conflict between *658 state and federal courts.” <citedDecision>364 U. S., at 221</citedDecision> .  Such a conflict, hereafter needless, arose this very Term, in Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U. S. 381 (1961), in which, and in spite of the promise made by Rea , we gave full recognition to our practice in this regard by refusing to restrain a federal officer from testifying in a state court as to evidence unconstitutionally seized by him in the performance of his duties.  Yet the double standard recognized until today hardly put such a thesis into practice.  In non-exclusionary States, federal officers, being human, were by it invited to and did, as our cases indicate, step across the street to the State’s attorney with their unconstitutionally seized evidence.  Prosecution on the basis of that evidence was then had in a state court in utter disregard of the enforceable Fourth Amendment.  If the fruits of an unconstitutional search had been inadmissible in both state and federal courts, this inducement to evasion would have been sooner eliminated.  There would be no need to reconcile such cases as Rea and Schnettler , each pointing up the hazardous uncertainties of our heretofore ambivalent approach.  Federal-state cooperation in the solution of crime under constitutional standards will be promoted, if only by recognition of their now mutual obligation to respect the same fundamental criteria in their approaches.  “However much in a particular case insistence upon such rules may appear as a technicality that inures to the benefit of a guilty person, the history of the criminal law proves that tolerance of shortcut methods in law enforcement impairs its enduring effectiveness.” Miller v. United States, 357 U. S. 301, 313 (1958).  Denying shortcuts to only one of two cooperating law enforcement agencies tends naturally to breed legitimate suspicion of “working arrangements” whose results are equally tainted.  Byars v. United States, 273 U. S. 28 (1927); Lustig v. United States, 338 U. S. 74 (1949).  *659 There are those who say, as did Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, that under our constitutional exclusionary doctrine “[t]he criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.” People v. Defore, 242 N. Y., at 21 , 150 N. E., at 587 , In some cases this will undoubtedly be the result.  9 But, as was said in <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> , “there is another consideration — the imperative of judicial integrity.” <citedDecision>364 U. S., at 222</citedDecision> .  The criminal goes free, if he must, but it is the law that sets him free. Nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the chartei of its own existence.  As Mr. Justice Brandéis, dissenting, said in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 485 (1928): “Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.  ... If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.” Nor can it lightly be assumed that, as a practical matter, adoption of the exclusionary rule fetters law enforcement.  Only last year this Court expressly considered that contention and found that “pragmatic evidence of a sort” to the contrary was not wanting.  <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 218.  The Court noted that “The federal courts themselves have operated under the exclusionary rule of Weeks for almost half a cen *660 tury; yet it has not been suggested.  either that the Federal Bureau of Investigation 10 has thereby been rendered ineffective, or that the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts has thereby been disrupted.  Moreover, the experience of the states is impressive.  .  .  .

As is always the case, however, state procedural requirements governing assertion and pursuance of direct and collateral constitutional challenges to criminal prosecutions must be respected.
