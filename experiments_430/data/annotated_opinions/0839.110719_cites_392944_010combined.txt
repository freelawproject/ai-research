**Combined Opinion**
 The court remanded for a new trial at which the items taken from the paper bag, but not those from the leather pouch, could be admitted.  [2] The entire Court of Appeals then voted to rehear the case en banc.  A majority of the court rejected the panel's conclusion that a distinction of constitutional significance existed between the two containers found in respondent's trunk; it held that the police should not have opened either container without first obtaining a warrant.  The court reasoned: "No specific, well-delineated exception called to our attention permits the police to dispense with a warrant to open and search `unworthy' containers.  Moreover, we believe that a rule under which the validity of a warrantless search would turn on judgments about the durability of a container would impose an unreasonable and unmanageable burden on police and courts.  For these reasons, and because the Fourth Amendment protects all persons, not just those with the resources or fastidiousness to place their effects in containers that decision-makers would rank in the luggage line, we hold that the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement forbids the warrantless opening of a closed, opaque paper bag to the same extent that it forbids the warrantless opening of a small unlocked suitcase or a zippered leather pouch." 210 U. S. App. D. C. 342, 344, <citedDecision>655 F. 2d 1159, 1161</citedDecision> (1981) (footnote omitted).  *803 The en banc Court of Appeals considered, and rejected, the argument that it was reasonable for the police to open both the paper bag and the leather pouch because they were entitled to conduct a warrantless search of the entire vehicle in which the two containers were found. The majority concluded that this argument was foreclosed by Sanders .  Three dissenting judges interpreted Sanders differently.  [3] Other courts also have read the Sanders opinion in different ways.  [4] Moreover, disagreement concerning the proper interpretation of Sanders was at least partially responsible for the fact that Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 , was decided last Term without a Court opinion.  There is, however, no dispute among judges about the importance of striving for clarification in this area of the law. For countless vehicles are stopped on highways and public *804 streets every day, and our cases demonstrate that it is not uncommon for police officers to have probable cause to believe that contraband may be found in a stopped vehicle.  In every such case a conflict is presented between the individual's constitutionally protected interest in privacy and the public interest in effective law enforcement.

 [8] B Finally, the majority's new rule is theoretically unsound and will create anomalous and unwarranted results.  These consequences are readily apparent from the Court's attempt to reconcile its new rule with the holdings of Chadwick and Sanders .  [9] The Court suggests that probable cause to search only a container does not justify a warrantless search of an automobile in which it is placed, absent reason to believe that the contents could be secreted elsewhere in the vehicle.  This, the majority asserts, is an indication that the new rule is carefully limited to its justification, and is not inconsistent with Chadwick and Sanders .  But why is such a container more private, less difficult for police to seize and store, or in any other relevant respect more properly subject to the warrant *840 requirement, than a container that police discover in a probable-cause search of an entire automobile?  [10] This rule plainly has peculiar and unworkable consequences: the Government "must show that the investigating officer knew enough but not too much, that he had sufficient knowledge to establish probable cause but insufficient knowledge to know exactly where the contraband was located." 210 U. S. App. D. C. 342, 384, <citedDecision>655 F. 2d 1159, 1201</citedDecision> (1981) (en banc) (Wilkey, J., dissenting).  Alternatively, the majority may be suggesting that Chadwick and Sanders may be explained because the connection of the container to the vehicle was incidental in these two cases. That is, because police had pre-existing probable cause to seize and search the containers, they were not entitled to wait until the item was placed in a vehicle to take advantage of the automobile exception.  Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971); 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 519-525 (1978).  I wholeheartedly agree that police cannot employ a pretext to escape Fourth Amendment prohibitions and cannot rely on an exigency that they could easily have avoided.  This interpretation, however, might well be an exception that swallows up the majority's rule.  In neither Chadwick nor Sanders did the Court suggest that the delay of the police was a pretext for taking advantage of the automobile exception.  For all that appears, the Government may have had legitimate reasons for not searching as soon as they had probable cause.

U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.  [2]  The court rejected the Government's argument that the warrantless search of the leather pouch was justified as incident to respondent's arrest.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 137a.  The Government has not challenged this holding.  [3]  Judge Tamm, the author of the original panel opinion, reiterated the view that Sanders prohibited the warrantless search of the leather pouch but not the search of the paper bag.  Judge Robb agreed that this result was compelled by Sanders , although he stated that in his opinion "the right to search an automobile should include the right to open any container found within the automobile, just as the right to search a lawfully arrested prisoner carries with it the right to examine the contents of his wallet and any envelope found in his pocket, and the right to search a room includes authority to open and search all the drawers and containers found within the room." 210 U. S. App. D. C., at 363, <citedDecision>655 F. 2d, at 1180</citedDecision> .  Judge MacKinnon concurred with Judge Tamm that Sanders did not prohibit the warrantless search of the paper bag.  Concerning the leather pouch, he agreed with Judge Wilkey, who dissented on the ground that Sanders should not be applied retroactively.  [4]  Many courts have held that Sanders requires that a warrant be obtained only for personal luggage and other "luggage-type" containers.  See, e. g., United States v. Brown, 635 F. 2d 1207 (CA6 1980); United States v. Jimenez, 626 F. 2d 39 (CA7 1980).  One court has held that Sanders does not apply if the police have probable cause to search an entire vehicle and not merely an isolated container within it.  Cf. State v. Bible, 389 So. 2d 42 (La. 1980), vacated and remanded, 453 U. S. 918 ; State v. Hernandez, 408 So. 2d 911 (La. 1981); see also 210 U. S. App. D. C., at 363, <citedDecision>655 F. 2d, at 1180</citedDecision> (Robb, J., dissenting).  [5]  On September 29, 1921, Carroll and Kiro met the agents in Grand Rapids and agreed to sell them three cases of whiskey.  The sale was not consummated, however, possibly because Carroll learned the agents' true identity.  In October, the agents discovered Carroll and Kiro driving the Oldsmobile Roadster on the road to Detroit, which was known as an active center for the introduction of illegal liquor into this country.  The agents followed the roadster as far as East Lansing, but there abandoned the chase. [6]  The legislation authorized customs officials to search any ship or vessel without a warrant if they had probable cause to believe that it concealed goods subject to duty.  The same legislation required a warrant for searches of dwelling places.  267 U. S., at 150-151 .

 In my view, the plurality's requirement cannot be so justified.  The aggregate burden of procuring warrants whenever an officer has probable cause to search the most trivial container may be heavy and will not be compensated by the advancement of important Fourth Amendment values." 453 U. S., at 433-434 (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment).  The substantial burdens on law enforcement identified by JUSTICE POWELL would, of course, not be affected by the character of the container found during an automobile search.  No comparable practical problems arise when the official suspicion is confined to a particular piece of luggage, as in Chadwick and Sanders.  Cf. n. 19, supra. [22]  The en banc Court of Appeals stated that "[b]ased on the tip the police received, Ross's car was properly stopped and searched, and the pouch and bag were properly seized." 210 U. S. App. D. C., at 361, <citedDecision>655 F. 2d, at 1168</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  The court explained: "[W]e believe it clear that the police had ample and reasonable cause to stop Ross and to search his car. The informer had supplied accurate information on prior occasions, and he was an eyewitness to sales of narcotics by Ross.  He said he had just seen Ross take narcotics from the trunk of his car in making a sale and heard him say he possessed additional narcotics." Id., at 361, n. 22, <citedDecision>655 F. 2d, at 1168, n. 22</citedDecision> .  The court further noted: "In this case, the informant told the police that Ross had narcotics in the trunk of his car. No specific container was identified." Id., at 359, <citedDecision>655 F. 2d, at 1166</citedDecision> .  [23]  At the suppression hearing, defense counsel asked the police officer who had conducted the search: "Isn't it possible to put other goods in a bag that has the resemblance of a whiskey bag?" The officer responded: "I suppose it is.  I did not think of that at that time.  I knew it was whiskey, I was sure it was." App., O. T. 1930, No. 477, p. 27.  [24]  App., O. T. 1938, No. 49, p. 33.
