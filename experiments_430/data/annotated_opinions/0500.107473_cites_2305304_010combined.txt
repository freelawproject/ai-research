**Combined Opinion**
 It is so ordered.  [For dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Clark, see post, p. 546.] 1 The inspection was conducted pursuant to § 86 (3) of the San Francisco Municipal Code, which provides that apartment house operators shall pay an annual license fee in part to defray the cost of periodic inspections of their buildings.  The inspections are to be made by the Bureau of Housing Inspection “at least once a year and as often thereafter as may be deemed necessary.” The permit of occupancy, which prescribes the apartment units which a building may contain, is not issued until the license is obtained.  2 “Sec.  507 PENALTY FOR Violation.  Any person, the owner or his authorized agent who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with, or who resists or opposes the execution of any of the provisions of this Code, or any order of the Superintendent, the Director of Public Works, or the Director of Public Health made pursuant to this Code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), or by imprisonment, not exceeding six (6) months or by both such fine and imprisonment, unless otherwise provided in this Code, and shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for every day such violation, disobedience, omission, neglect or refusal shall continue.” 3 Givner v. State, <citedDecision>210 Md. 484</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>124 A. 2d 764</citedDecision> (1956); City of St. Louis v. Evans, 337 S. W. 2d 948 (Mo. 1960); State ex rel. Eaton v. Pnce, 168 Ohio St. 123 , 151 N. E. 2d 523 (1958), aff’d by an equally divided Court, 364 U. S. 263 (1960).  See also State v. Rees, 258 Iowa 813 , 139 N. W. 2d 406 (1966); Commonwealth v. Hadley, 351 Mass. 439 , 222 N. E. 2d 681 (1966), appeal docketed Jan. 5, 1967, No. 1179, Misc., O. T. 1966; People v. Laverne, 14 N. Y. 2d 304, 200 N. E. 2d 441 (1964).  4 In Frank , the Baltimore ordinance required that the health inspector “have cause to suspect that a nuisance exists in any house, cellar or enclosure” before he could demand entry without a warrant, a requirement obviously met in Frank because the inspector observed extreme structural decay and a pile of rodent feces on the appellant’s premises.  Section 503 of the San Francisco Housing Code has no such “cause” requirement, but neither did the Ohio ordinance at issue in Eaton v. Price , a case which four Justices thought was controlled by Frank.  364 U. S., at 264, 265, n. 2 (opinion of Mr. Justice BrennaN).  5 See Boyd v. United States, 116 17.  S. 616.
