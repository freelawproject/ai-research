 In subsequent Commerce Clause challenges to state regulation of exports of natural resources, the West analysis emerged as the dominant approach.  See, e. g., Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 598-600 (1923); 9 H. P. Hood & Sons, *331 Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525 (1949).  Today’s principle is that stated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970): “Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.  ... If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree.  And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.” (Citations omitted.) This formulation was employed only last Term to strike down New Jersey’s attempt to “conserve” the natural resource of landfill areas within the State for the disposal of waste generated within the State.  Philadelphia v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>437 U. S. 617, 624</citedDecision> (1978).  The Geer analysis has also been eroded to the point of virtual extinction in cases involving regulation of wild animals.  The first challenge to Geer’s, theory of a State’s power over wild animals came in Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920).  The State of Missouri, relying on the theory of state ownership of wild animals, attacked the Migratory Bird Treaty Act on the ground that it interfered with the State’s control over wild animals within its boundaries.  Writing for the Court, Mr. Justice Holmes upheld the Act as a proper *332 exercise of the treatymaking power.  He commented in passing on the artificiality of the Geer rationale: “To put the claim of the State upon title is to lean upon a slender reed.” 252 U. S., at 434 .  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928), undermined Geer even more directly.
**Lead Opinion**
 At the same time, the general rule we adopt in this case makes ample allowance for preserving, in ways not *336 inconsistent with the Commerce Clause, the legitimate state concerns for conservation and protection of wild animals underlying the 19th-century legal fiction of state ownership.  II We turn then to the question whether the burden imposed on interstate commerce in wild game by § 4-115 (B) is permissible under the general rule articulated in our precedents governing other types of commerce.  See, e. g., Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S., at 142 , quoted, supra, at 331.  Under that general rule, we must inquire (1) whether the challenged statute regulates evenhandedly with only “incidental” effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce either on its face or in practical effect; (2) whether the statute serves a legitimate local purpose; and, if so, (3) whether alternative means could promote this local purpose as well without discriminating against interstate commerce.  The burden to show discrimination rests on the party challenging the validity of the statute, but “[w]hen discrimination against commerce ... is demonstrated, the burden falls on the State to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve, the local interests at stake.” Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333, 353 (1977).  Furthermore, when considering the purpose of a challenged statute, this Court is not bound by “[t]he name, description or characterization given it by the legislature or the courts of the State,” but will determine for itself the practical impact of the law. Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545, 550 (1924); see Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S., at 10 ; Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., supra. Section 4-115 (B.) on its face discriminates against interstate commerce.  It forbids the transportation of natural min *337 nows out of the State for purposes of sale, and thus “overtly blocks the flow of interstate commerce at [the] State’s borders.” <citedDecision>Philadelphia</citedDecision> v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>437 U. S., at 624</citedDecision> .  Such facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect, regardless of the State’s purpose, because “the evil of protectionism can reside in legislative means as well as legislative ends.” <citedDecision>Id., at 626</citedDecision> .  17 At a minimum such facial discrimination invokes the strictest scrutiny of any purported legitimate local purpose and of the absence of nondiscriminatory alternatives.  Oklahoma argues that § A-115 (B) serves a legitimate local purpose in that it is “readily apparent as a conservation measure.” Brief for Appellee 8.  The State’s interest in maintaining the ecological balance in state waters by avoiding the removal of inordinate numbers of minnows may well qualify as a legitimate local purpose.  We consider the States’ interests in conservation and protection of wild animals as legitimate local purposes similar to the States’ interests in protecting the health and safety of their citizens.  See, e. g., Firemen v. Chicago, R. I.  & P. R. Co., 393 U. S. 129 (1968).

 Any person convicted of violating any provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00).” The prohibition against transportation out of State for sale thus does not apply to hatchery-bred minnows, but only to “natural” minnows seined or procured from waters within the State.  Section 4r-115 (B) is part of the Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Code. Another provision of that Code requires that persons have a minnow dealer’s license before they can lawfully seine or trap minnows within the State — except for their own use as bait — §4^11(5 (Supp. 1978), but no limit is imposed on the number of minnows a licensed dealer may take from state waters.  Nor is there any regulation except § 4r-115 (B) concerning the disposition of lawfully acquired minnows; they may be sold within Oklahoma to any person and for any purpose, and may be taken out of the State for any purpose except sale.  “The Commerce Clause is one of the most prolific sources of national power and an equally prolific source of conflict with legislation of the state.  While the Constitution vests in Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, it does not say what the states may or may not do in the absence of congressional action, nor how to draw the line between what is and what is not commerce among the states.  Perhaps even more than by interpretation of its written word, this Court has advanced the solidarity and prosperity of this Nation by the meaning it has given to these great silences of the Constitution.” H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S., at 534-535 .  Philadelphia v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>437 U. S. 617, 621-623</citedDecision> (1978), made clear that there is no “two-tiered definition of commerce.” The definition of “commerce” is the same when relied on to strike down or restrict state legislation as when relied on to support some exertion of federal control or regulation.  See, e. g., Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 209 (1824); Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 (1829); Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1852); Port Richmond & Bergen Point Perry Co. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, 234 U. S. 317 (1914); Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, 273 U. S. 34 (1927); Parker v.

Or, to state it otherwise, had the State of Connecticut the power to regulate the killing of game within her borders so as to confine its use to the limits of the State and forbid its transmission outside of the State?” 161 U. S., at 522 .  Id., at 522-529 .  The Court has recognized that Geer’s analysis of the authorities on this issue is open to question.
**Lead Opinion**
 .  .  the Court has recognized that the States’ interest in regulating and controlling those things they claim to 'own,’ including wildlife, is by no means absolute.  States may not compel the confinement of the benefits of their resources, even .their wildlife, to their own people whenever such hoarding and confinement impedes interstate commerce.  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928) ; Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923); West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911).” Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, 436 U. S. 371, 385-386 (1978).  See, e. g., Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 , 285 n. 21 (1977).  “ [W] hatever [a State’s] ultimate purpose, it may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently.” <citedDecision>Philadelphia</citedDecision> v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>437 U. S., at 626-627</citedDecision> .  See n. 1, supra. Section 4-115 (B) does not apply to persons transporting three dozen or less natural minnows outside the State.  See n. 1, supra. In its brief, Oklahoma argues, apparently for the first time, that the discrimination against out-of-state sales of natural minnows is justified because minnows purchased in the State are more likely to be used for bait in state waters.  Brief for Appellee 3.  The State contends that minnows “returned” to state waters as bait do not upset the ecological balance as much as those that never “return.” The late appearance of this argument and the total absence of any record support for the questionable factual assumptions that underlie it give it the flavor of a post hoc rationalization.  The State’s bare assertion is certainly inadequate to survive the scrutiny invoked by the facial discrimination of § 4r-115 (B).  In any case, Oklahoma itself concedes that the “return” of natural minnows as bait is irrelevant to most aspects of preserving ecological balance.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting. This Court’s seeming preoccupation in recent years with laws relating to wildlife must, I suspect, appear curious to casual observers of this institution. 1 It is no more curious, however, than this Court’s recent pronouncements on the validity of Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 (1896). For less than one year ago we unreservedly reaffirmed the principles announced in Geer. Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, 436 U. S. 371, 386 (1978). Today, the Court overrules that decision. Because I disagree with the Court’s overruling of Geer and holding that Oklahoma’s law relating to the sale of minnows violates the Commerce Clause, I dissent. In its headlong rush to overrule Geer , the Court characterizes that decision as “rest[ing] on the holding that no interstate commerce was involved.” Ante, at 327. It is true that one of the rationales relied on by the Geer Court was that the State could exercise its power to control the killing and ownership of animals ferae naturae to prohibit such game *340 from leaving the borders of the State and thus prevent the game from ever becoming the objects of interstate commerce. 161 U. S., at 530-532 . Since the Court in Geer was of the view that the challenged statute effectively prevented certain game from entering the stream of interstate commerce, there could be no basis for a Commerce Clause challenge to the State’s law. Id., at 530, 532 . 2 I do not dispute the Court’s rejection of this theory; as the Court points out, this rationale was rejected long before today. Ante, at 329; see West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911). My objection is that this line of reasoning, while undoubtedly considered important by the majority in Geer , is unnecessary to sustain that decision 3 and is unneeded in the disposition of the pres *341 ent case. And no one — not the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals or the State in this Court — contends that the minnows at issue are not the subjects of interstate commerce. It is obvious that the Court has simply set this theory up as a sort of strawman to facilitate the toppling of a decision which, in other respects, enunciates principles that have remained valid and vital, albeit somewhat refined, at least until today. 4 The Court in Geer expressed the view derived from Roman law that the wild fish and game located within the territorial limits of a State are the common property of its citizens and that the State, as a kind of trustee, may exercise this common “ownership" for the benefit of its citizens. 161 U. S., at 529 . Admittedly, a State does not “own” the wild creatures within its borders in any conventional sense of the word. 5 Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra, at 386; Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265, 284 (1977); Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 401-402 (1948); Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 434 (1920). But the concept expressed by the “ownership” doctrine is not obsolete. Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra, at 392 (Burger, C. J., concurring). This Court long has recognized that the ownership *342 language of Geer and similar cases is simply a shorthand way of describing a State’s substantial interest in preserving and regulating the exploitation of the fish and game and other natural resources within its boundaries for the benefit of its citizens. 436 U. S., at 386 ; Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 284; Toomer v. Witsell, supra, at 402 . In recognition of this important state interest, the Court has upheld a variety of regulations designed to conserve and maintain the natural resources of a State. See, e. g., Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra; Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440 (1960); Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545 (1924); Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 138 (1914); Geer v. Connecticut, supra; Manchester v. Massachusetts, 139 U. S. 240 (1891); McCready v. Virginia, 94 U. S. 391 (1877); Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71 (1855). To be sure, a State’s power to preserve and regulate wildlife within its borders is not absolute. 6 But the State is accorded wide latitude in fashioning regulations appropriate for protection of its wildlife. Unless the regulation directly conflicts with a federal statute or treaty, Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 283-285; Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529, 546 (1976); Missouri v. Holland, supra, at 434 ; allocates access in a manner that violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm’n, 334 U. S. 410 (1948); or represents a naked attempt to discriminate against out-of-state enterprises in favor of in-state businesses unrelated to any purpose of conservation, Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1, 13 (1928), the State’s special interest in preserving its wild *343 life should prevail. And this is true no matter how “Bal-kanized” the resulting pattern of commercial activity. 7 The Oklahoma law at issue in this case serves the special interest of the State, as representative of its citizens, in preserving and regulating exploitation of free-swimming minnows found within its waters. “[T]he law serve [s] to protect against the depletion of minnows in Oklahoma’s natural streams through commercial exportation.” 572 P. 2d 573, 575 (Okla. Crim. App. 1977). Oklahoma’s statutory scheme may not be the most artfully designed to accomplish its pur *344 pose. 8 But the range of regulations that a State may adopt under these circumstances is extremely broad, particularly where, as here, the burden on interstate commerce is, at most, minimal. See Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S., at 288 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, supra, at 552; cf. Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, 436. U. S., at 391; Kleppe v. New Mexico, supra, at 545 . Contrary to the view of the Court, I do not think that Oklahoma’s regulation of the commercial exploitation of natural minnows either discriminates against out-of-state enterprises in favor of local businesses or that it burdens the interstate commerce in minnows. At least, no such showing has been made on the record before us. Cf. Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 154 (1963). This is not a case where a State’s regulation permits residents to export naturally seined minnows but prohibits nonresidents from so doing. No person is allowed to export natural minnows for sale outside of Oklahoma; the statute is evenhanded in its application. See Okla. Stat., Tit. 29, § 4r-115 (B) (Supp. 1978). The State has not used its power to protect its own citizens from outside competition. See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333 (1977); H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525 (1949). Nor is this a *345 case where a State requires a nonresident business, as a condition to exporting minnows, to move a significant portion of its operations to the State or to use certain state resources in pursuit of its business for the benefit of the local economy. See Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385 (1948); Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928); Johnson v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 16 (1928); cf. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 145 (1970). And, notwithstanding the Court’s protestations to the contrary, Oklahoma has not blocked the flow of interstate commerce in minnows at the State’s borders. See ante, at 336-337. Appellant, or anyone else, may freely export as many minnows as he wishes, so long as the minnows so transported are hatchery minnows and not naturally seined minnows. On this record, I simply fail to see how interstate commerce in minnows, the commodity at issue here, is impeded in the least by Oklahoma’s regulatory scheme. 9 Oklahoma does regulate the manner in which both residents and nonresidents procure minnows to be sold outside the State. But there is no showing in this record that requiring appellant to purchase his minnows from hatcheries instead of from persons licensed to seine minnows from the State’s waters in any way increases appellant’s costs of doing business. There also is nothing in the record to indicate that naturally seined minnows are any more desirable as items of commerce than hatchery minnows. So far as the record before us indicates, hatchery minnows and naturally seined minnows are fungible. Accordingly, any minimal burden that may result from requiring appellant to purchase minnows destined for sale out of state from hatcheries instead of from *346 those licensed to seine minnows is, in my view, more than outweighed by Oklahoma’s substantial interest in conserving and regulating exploitation of its natural minnow population. I therefore would affirm the judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. See, e. g., TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153 (1978) (snail darters); Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, 436 U. S. 371 (1978) (elk); Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 (1977) (menhaden); Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529 (1976) (wild horses and burros). “The fact that internal commerce may be distinct from interstate commerce, destroys the whole theory upon which the argument of the plaintiff in error proceeds. The power of the State to control the killing of and ownership in game being admitted, the commerce in game, which the state law permitted, was necessarily only internal commerce, since the restriction that it should not become the subject of external commerce went along with the grant and was a part of it.” Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S., at 532 . The Court in Geer assigned an alternative basis for its decision. The Court held that a State, in the exercise of its police power, could act to preserve for its people a valuable food supply, even though interstate commerce was remotely and indirectly affected. “Aside from the authority of the State, derived from the common ownership of game and the trust for the benefit of its people which the State exercises in relation thereto, there is another view of the power of the State in regard to the property in game, which is equally conclusive. The right to preserve game flows from the undoubted existence in the State of a police power to that end, which may be none the less efficiently called into play, because by doing so interstate commerce may be remotely and indirectly affected. Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1 , Hall v. De Cuir, 95 U. S. 485 ; Sherlock v. Alling, 93 U. S. 99, 103 ; Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 . Indeed, the source of the police power as to game birds (like those covered by the statute here called into question) flows from the duty of the State to preserve for its people a valuable food supply.” Id., at 534. See also New York ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg, 211 U. S. 31, 41-42 (1908); *341 Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 563 , 601 (1923) (Holmes, J., dissenting). Certain of the statements in the Court’s opinion provide a basis for some hope that these principles may yet survive the overruling of Geer . See ante, at 337: “We consider the States’ interests in conservation and protection of wild animals as legitimate local purposes”; ante, at 338: “The overruling of Geer does not leave the States powerless to protect and conserve wild animal life within their borders.” The Geer Court itself did not use the term “ownership” in any proprietary sense. See 161 U. S., at 529 : “ 'We take it to be the correct doctrine in this country, that the ownership of wild animals, so far as they are capable of ownership, is in the State, not as a proprietor but in its sovereign capacity as the representative and for the benefit of all its people in common.’ ” Geer recognized limits to the exercise of the State’s power to preserve wildlife within its boundaries. See id., at 528 (this power, which the Colonies possessed, remains in the States “at the present day, in so far as its exercise may be not incompatible with, or restrained by, the rights conveyed to the Federal government by the Constitution”). This view is fully consistent with the balancing approach to Commerce Clause decisionmaking enunciated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137 (1970), relied on so heavily by the Court. Ante, at 336. In Pike , the Court stated: “Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. ... If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.” 397 U. S., at 142 . Given the primacy of the local interest here, in the absence of conflicting federal regulation I would require one challenging a state conservation law on Commerce Clause grounds to establish a far greater burden on interstate commerce than is shown in this case. See infra, at 344-345. See also Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333, 350 (1977): “[O]ur opinions have long recognized that, 'in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the state to make laws governing matteis of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it’ H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 567 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting): “Behind the distinction between 'substantial’ and ‘incidental’ burdens upon interstate commerce is a recognition that, in the absence of federal regulation, it is sometimes — of course not always — of greater importance that local interests be protected than that interstate commerce be not touched.” The Court seems to doubt the conservation purpose of the Oklahoma law because the State places no limit on the number of minnows a licensed dealer may take from state waters and imposes no regulation governing the disposition of minnows within the State. Ante, at 337-338, and n. 20. But the State could rationally have concluded that it could adequately preserve its natural minnow population without such additional measures. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18, 20, 21-23. Since, in my view, the prohibition on export of naturally seined minnows imposes little, if any, burden on the interstate commerce in minnows, the State has not violated the Commerce Clause by choosing an export ban on natural minnows as the means to effectuate its special interest in conserving wildlife located within its territorial limits. Thus, even putting aside the decision in Geer and the principles for which it has come to be known and considering the Oklahoma statute “according to the same general rule applied to state regulations of other natural resources,” ante, at 335, the Court still has failed to explain how Oklahoma’s laws burden or discriminate against interstate commerce in minnows.

H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S., at 534-535 .  Philadelphia v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>437 U. S. 617, 621-623</citedDecision> (1978), made clear that there is no "two-tiered definition of commerce." The definition of "commerce" is the same when relied on to strike down or restrict state legislation as when relied on to support some exertion of federal control or regulation.

Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1852); Port Richmond & Bergen Point Ferry Co. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, 234 U. S. 317 (1914); Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, 273 U. S. 34 (1927); Parker v.

[4]  "[T]he sole issue which the case presents is, was it lawful under the Constitution of the United States (section 8, Article I) for the State of Connecticut to allow the killing of birds within the State during a designated open season, to allow such birds, when so killed, to be used, to be sold and to be bought for use within the State, and yet to forbid their transportation beyond the State?  Or, to state it otherwise, had the State of Connecticut the power to regulate the killing of game within her b orders so as to confine its use to the limits of the State and forbid its transmission outside of the State?" 161 U. S., at 522 .
**Combined Opinion**
 the Court has recognized that the States' interest in regulating and controlling those things they claim to `own,' including wildlife, is by no means absolute.  States may not compel the confinement of the benefits of their resources, even their wildlife, to their own people whenever such hoarding and confinement impedes interstate commerce.  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928); Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923); West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911)." Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, 436 U. S. 371, 385-386 (1978).  [16]  See, e. g., Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 , 285 n. 21 (1977).  [17]  "[W]hatever [a State's] ultimate purpose, it may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently." <citedDecision>Philadelphia</citedDecision> v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>437 U. S., at 626-627</citedDecision> .  [18]  See n. 1, supra. [19]  Section 4-115 (B) does not apply to persons transporting three dozen or less natural minnows outside the State.  See n. 1, supra. [20]  In its brief, Oklahoma argues, apparently for the first time, that the discrimination against out-of-state sales of natural minnows is justified because minnows purchased in the State are more likely to be used for bait in state waters.  Brief for Appellee 3.  The State contends that minnows "returned" to state waters as bait do not upset the ecological balance as much as those that never "return." The late appearance of this argument and the total absence of any record support for the questionable factual assumptions that underlie it give it the flavor of a post hoc rationalization.  The State's bare assertion is certainly inadequate to survive the scrutiny invoked by the facial discrimination of § 4-115 (B).
