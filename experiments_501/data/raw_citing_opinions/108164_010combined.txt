  We granted the writ to consider the power of a State to retry an accused for murder after an earlier guilty verdict on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter had been set aside because of a trial error.

  Petitioner was charged with the killing of Johnnie Mae Dupree in an indictment for the offense of murder filed in the Superior Court of Effingham County, Georgia. He entered a plea of not guilty and was tried on October 17, 1962. The jury returned a verdict of guilty to the lesser included crime of voluntary manslaughter and fixed the sentence at 10 to 15 years in the state penitentiary. The jury’s verdict made no reference to the charge of murder.

  On October 20, 1967, petitioner was again placed on trial for murder under the original indictment. Before the commencement of the second trial petitioner entered a plea of
  <em>
   autrefois acquit,
  </em>
  claiming that to place him again on trial for the offense of murder would expose him to double jeopardy in view of the verdict of voluntary manslaughter at the initial trial. The trial judge rejected the plea and, at the close of the trial, included instructions on the offense of murder in his charge to the jury so that the jury could have rendered a verdict of guilty on that offense. That jury, like the first, found petitioner guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and then fixed the penalty at 10 years’ imprisonment.

S. 662, 669</a></span> (1896), this Court observed: “The Constitution of the United States, in the Fifth Amendment, declares, ‘nor shall any person be subject [for the same offense] to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.’ The prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice
  <em>
   put
  </em>
  in jeopardy . . . .” (Emphasis added.) The “twice put in jeopardy” language of the Constitution thus relates to a potential,
  <em>
   i. e.,
  </em>
  the risk that an accused for a second time will be convicted of the “same offense” for which he was initially tried.
 </p>
<p id="b382-8">
  The circumstances that give rise to such a forbidden potential have been the subject of much discussion in this Court. In the
  <em>
   <span class="citation" data-id="94515"><a href="/opinion/94515/united-states-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ball">Ball</a></span>
  </em>
  case, for example, the Court expressly rejected the view that the double jeopardy provision prevented a second trial when a conviction had been set aside. In so doing, it effectively formulated a concept of continuing jeopardy that has application where criminal proceedings against an accused have not run their full course. See
  <em>
   Green
  </em>
  v.
  <em>
   United States,
  </em>
  <span class="citation" data-id="105594"><a href="/opinion/105594/green-v-united-states/#189" aria-description="Citation for case: Green v. United States">355 U. S. 184, 189</a></span> (1957).
 </p>
<p id="b382-9">
  The continuing jeopardy principle necessarily is applicable to this case. Petitioner sought and obtained the
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="327"> 
   *327
   </span>
  reversal of his initial conviction for voluntary manslaughter by taking an appeal. Accordingly, no aspect of the bar on double jeopardy prevented his retrial for that crime. However, the first verdict, limited as it was to the lesser included offense, required that the retrial be limited to that lesser offense. Such a result flows inescapably from the Constitution’s emphasis on a risk of conviction and the Constitution’s explication in prior decisions of this Court.

  over a dissent by Mr. Justice Holmes that argued that there was only one continuing jeopardy until the proceedings against the accused had been finally resolved.

  the petitioner had been tried and convicted of first-degree murder after an earlier guilty verdict on the lesser included offense of second-degree murder had been set aside on appeal. A majority of the Court rejected the argument that by appealing the conviction of second-degree murder the petitioner had “waived” his plea of former jeopardy with regard to the charge of first-degree murder.

  </em>
  case reversed the first-degree murder conviction obtained at the retrial, holding that the petitioner’s jeopardy for first-degree murder came to an end when the jury was discharged at the end of his first trial. This conclusion rested on two premises. First, the Court considered the first jury’s verdict of guilty on the second-degree murder charge to be an “implicit acquittal” on the charge of first-degree murder.
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="329"> 
   *329
   </span>
  Second, and more broadly, the Court reasoned that petitioner’s jeopardy on the greater charge had ended when the first jury “was given a full opportunity to return a verdict” on that charge and instead reached a verdict on the lesser charge. <span class="citation" data-id="105594"><a href="/opinion/105594/green-v-united-states/#191" aria-description="Citation for case: Green v.

  case — that there could be no appeal from an acquittal because such a verdict ended an accused’s jeopardy — was applicable.

  The rationale of the

  <a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref">

  cases illustrate, this Court has consistently refused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after an acquittal, whether that acquittal is express or implied by a conviction on a lesser included offense when the jury was given a full opportunity
  <a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref">

  case presented a situation where a defendant’s appeal from a conviction for a
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="330">

  lesser included offense ultimately led to retrial and conviction on the greater offense. After the second conviction had been affirmed on appeal,, the defendant sued out a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Georgia from this Court, contending “that the exemption from second jeopardy is one of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, which the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state to abridge”,
  <a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref">

  One further consideration remains. Because the petitioner was convicted of the same crime at both the first and second trials, and because he suffered no greater punishment on the subsequent conviction, Georgia submits that the second jeopardy was harmless error when judged by the criteria of

  We must reject this contention. The Double Jeopardy Clause, as we have noted, is cast in terms of the risk or hazard of trial and conviction, not of the ultimate legal consequences of the verdict. To be charged and to be subjected to a second trial for first-degree murder is an ordeal not to be viewed lightly.
