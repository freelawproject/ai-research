**Dissenting Opinion**
 We cannot close our eyes to the fact that certain States make an industry of their easy divorce laws, and encourage inhabitants of other States to obtain “quickie” divorces which their home States deny them.  14 To permit such States *367 to bind all others to their decrees would endow with constitutional sanctity a Gresham’s Law of domestic relations.  Fortunately, today’s decision does not go that far.  But its practical result will be to offer new inducements for conduct by parties and counsel, which, in any other type of litigation, would be regarded as perjury, but which is not so regarded where divorce is involved because ladies and gentlemen indulge in it.  But if the doctrine of res judicata as to jurisdictional facts in controversies involving exclusively private interests as infused into the Full Faith and Credit Clause is applied to divorce decrees so as to foreclose subsequent inquiry into jurisdiction, there is neither logic nor reason nor practical desirability in not taking the entire doctrine over.  Res judicata forecloses relitigation if there has been an opportunity to litigate once, whether or not it has been availed of, or carried as far as possible.  Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351 ; Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, <citedDecision>308 U. S. 371</citedDecision> .  15 And it applies to questions of jurisdiction of subject matter as well as to that of persons.  Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165 ; Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U. S. 66 .  Why should it not apply where there has been a wasted opportunity to litigate, but should apply where the form of a contest has been gone through?  16 Or if more than form is required, how much of a contest must it be?  Must the contest be bellicose or *368 may it be pacific?  Must it be fierce or may it be tepid?
