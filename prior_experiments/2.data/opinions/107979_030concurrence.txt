<p id="A8I">concurring.</p>
<p id="b843-5">I join the Court’s opinion with these remarks concerning a factor to which the Court has not alluded.</p>
<p id="b843-6">The only thing that has given me pause in voting to overrule <em>Harris </em>and <em>Rabinowitz </em>is that as a result of <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643 (1961), and <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U. S. 23 (1963), every change in Fourth Amendment law must now be obeyed by state officials facing widely different problems of local law enforcement. We simply do not know the extent to which cities and towns across the Nation are prepared to administer the greatly expanded warrant system which will be required by today’s decision; nor can we say with assurance that in each and every local situation, the warrant requirement plays an essential role in the protection of those fundamental liberties protected against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="b843-7">Thus, one is now faced with the dilemma, envisioned in my separate opinion in <em>Ker, </em>374 U. S., at 45-46, of choosing between vindicating sound Fourth Amendment principles at the possible expense of state concerns, long recognized to be consonant with the Fourteenth Amendment before <em>Mapp </em>and <em>Ker </em>came on the books, or diluting the Federal Bill of Rights in the interest of leaving the States at least some elbow room in their methods of criminal law enforcement. No comparable dilemma exists, of course, with respect to the impact of today’s decision within the federal system itself.</p>
<p id="b843-8">This federal-state factor has not been an easy one for me to resolve, but in the last analysis I cannot in good conscience vote to perpetuate bad Fourth Amendment law.</p>
<p id="b843-9">I add only that this case, together with <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, post, </em>p. 784, <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, ante, </em>p. 711, and <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Rice, ante, </em>p. 711, all decided <page-number citation-index="1" label="770">*770</page-number>today, serve to point up, as few other cases have, the profound changes that the “incorporation doctrine” has wrought both in the workings of our federal system and upon the adjudicative processes of this Court.</p>
