 16 Reversed.  The affidavit supporting the warrant is set out in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, 61 Cal. Rptr., at 715-716, n. 1, and the State does not challenge its insufficiency under the principles of Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108 , and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410 .  The Court assumed that the arrests were lawful.  282 U. S., at 356 .  See also McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 .  Decisions of this Court since Rabinowitz have applied the abstract doctrine of that case to various factual situations with divergent results.  Compare Ker v. California, <citedDecision>374 U. S. 23, 42</citedDecision> ; Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217 ; and Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307 , with Kremen v. United States, 353 U. S. 346 (per curiam).  Cf. Chapman v.

 .  against introduction of evidence seized without probable cause.” The Amendment is designed to prevent, not simply to redress, unlawful police action.  In any event, we cannot join in characterizing the invasion *767 of privacy that results from a top-to-bottom search of a man’s house as “minor.” And we can see no reason why, simply because some interference with an individual’s privacy and freedom of movement has lawfully taken place, further intrusions should automatically be allowed despite the absence of a warrant that the Fourth Amendment would otherwise require.  Although the warrant was issued at 10:39 a. m. and the arrest was not made until late in the afternoon, the State suggests that the delay is accounted for by normal police procedures and by the heavy workload of the officer in charge.  In addition, that officer testified that he and his colleagues went to the petitioner’s house “to keep from approaching him at his place of business to cause him any problem there.” See, e. g., J. Landynski, Search and Seizure and the Supreme Court 87-117 (1966); Way, Increasing Scope of Search Incidental to Arrest, 1959 Wash. U. L. Q. 261; Note, Scope Limitations for Searches Incident to Arrest, 78 Yale L. J. 433 (1969); Note, The Supreme Court 1966 Term, 81 Harv. L. Rev. 69 , 117-122 (1967).  Cf. Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U. S. 216, 220 ; Katz v. United States, 389 U. S., at 357-358, n. 20 ; Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S., at 299 ; Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483, 487 .  But see Cooper v. California, 386 U. S. 58, 62 ; <citedDecision>Ker</citedDecision> v. California, <citedDecision>374 U. S., at 42</citedDecision> (opinion of Clark, J.); cf. Beck v. Ohio, 379 U. S. 89, 91 ; Abel v. United States, 362 U. S., at 236-239 ; Giordenello v. United States, 357 U. S. 480, 488 .  The State has made various subsidiary contentions, including arguments that it would have been unduly burdensome to obtain a warrant specifying the coins to be seized and that introduction of the fruits of the search was harmless error.  We reject those contentions as being without merit.
