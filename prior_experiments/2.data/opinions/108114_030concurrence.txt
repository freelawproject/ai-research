<p id="b549-8">I join in the opinion of the Court although I must reject any implication in that opinion that the so-called due process test of “fundamental fairness” might have been appropriate as a constitutional standard at some point in the past or might have a continuing relevancy today in some areas of constitutional law. In my view it is a wholly fallacious idea that a judge’s sense of what is fundamentally “fair” or “unfair” should ever serve as a substitute for the explicit, written provisions of our Bill of Rights. One of these provisions is the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition against putting a man twice in jeopardy. On several occasions I have stated my view that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a State or the Federal Government or the two together from subjecting a defendant to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for the same alleged offense. <em>Bartkus </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>359 U. S. 121, 150 (1959) (dissenting <em>opinion); Abbate </em>v. <em>United States, </em>359 U. S. 187, 201 (1959) (dissenting opinion); <em>Ciucci </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>356 U. S. <page-number citation-index="1" label="448">*448</page-number>571, 575 (1958) (dissenting statement); <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U. S. 184 (1957). The opinion of the Court in the case today amply demonstrates that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is a basic and essential part of the Constitution’s prohibition against double jeopardy. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the Court’s opinion I fully agree that petitioner’s conviction must be reversed.</p>
