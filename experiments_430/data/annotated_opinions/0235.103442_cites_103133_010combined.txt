**Combined Opinion**
 See United States v. Ferger, supra; Virginian Ry. Co. v. Federation, 300 U. S. 515, 553 .  Congress, having by the present Act adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards, it may choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involve control of intrastate activities.  Such legislation has often been sustained with respect to powers, other than the commerce power granted to the national government, when the means chosen, although not themselves within the granted power, were nevertheless deemed appropriate aids to the accomplishment of some purpose within an admitted power of the national government.  See Jacob Ruppert, Inc. v. Caffey, 251 U. S. 264 ; Everard’s Breweries v. Day, 265 U. S. 545, 560 ; Westfall v. United States, 274 U. S. 256, 259 .  As to state power under the Fourteenth Amendment, compare Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S. 606, 609 ; St. John v. New York, 201 U. S. 633 ; Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192, 201-202 .  A familiar like exercise of power is the regulation of intrastate transactions which are so commingled with or related to interstate commerce that all must be regulated if the interstate commerce is to be effectively controlled.  Shreveport Case, 234 U. S. 342 ; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563 ; United States v. New York Central R. Co., supra, 464; Currin v. Wallace, <citedDecision>306 U. S. 1</citedDecision> ; Mulford v. Smith, supra. Similarly Congress may require inspection and preventive treatment of all cattle in a disease infected area in order to prevent shipment in interstate commerce of some of the cattle without the treatment.  Thornton v. United States, 271 U. S. 414 .  It may prohibit the removal, at destination, of labels required by the Pure Pood & Drugs Act to be affixed to ar *122 tides transported in interstate commerce.  McDermott v. Wisconsin, 228 U. S. 115 .  And we have recently held that Congress in the exercise of its power to require inspection and grading of tobacco shipped in interstate commerce may compel such inspection and grading of all tobacco sold at local auction rooms from which a substantial part but not all of the tobacco sold is shipped in interstate commerce.  <citedDecision>Currin</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>
   Wallace, supra,
  
  11</citedDecision> , and see to the like effect United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., supra, 568, note 37.  We think also that § 15 (a) (2), now under consideration, is sustainable independently of § 15 (a) (1), which prohibits shipment or transportation of the proscribed goods.  As we have said the evils aimed at by the Act are the spread of substandard labor conditions through the use of the facilities of interstate commerce for competition by the goods so produced with those produced under the prescribed or better labor conditions; and the consequent dislocation of the commerce itself caused by the impairment or destruction of local businesses by competition made effective through interstate commerce.  The Act' is thus directed at the suppression of a method or kind of competition in interstate commerce which it has in effect condemned as “unfair,” as the Clayton Act has condemned other “unfair methods of competition” made effective through interstate commerce.  See Van Camp & Sons Co. v. American Can Co., 278 U. S. 245 ; Federal Trade Comm’n v. Keppel & Bro., 291 U. S. 304 .  The Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act are familiar examples of the exertion of the commerce power to prohibit or control activities wholly intrastate because of their effect on interstate commerce.  See as to the Sherman Act, Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197 ; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U. S. 375 ; United States v. Patten, 226 U. S. 525 ; United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U. S. 344 ; Local *123 No. 167 v. United States, 291 U. S. 293 ; Stevens Co. v. Foster & Kleiser Co., 311 U. S. 255 .  As to the National Labor Relations Act, see National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, supra, and cases cited.  The means adopted by § 15 (a) (2) for the protection of interstate commerce by the suppression of the production of the condemned goods for interstate commerce is so related to the commerce and so affects it as to be within the reach of the commerce power.  See <citedDecision>Currin</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>
   Wallace, supra,
  
  11</citedDecision> .  Congress, to attain its objective in the suppression of nationwide competition in interstate commerce by goods produced under substandard’labor conditions, has made no distinction as to the volume or amount of shipments in the commerce or of production for commerce by any particular shipper or producer.  It recognized that in present day industry, competition by a small part may affect the whole and that the total effect of the competition of many small producers may be great.  See H. Rept. No. 2182, 75th Cong. 1st Sess., p. 7.  The legislation aimed at a whole embraces all its parts.  Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, supra, 606 .  So far as Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238 , is inconsistent with this conclusion, its doctrine is limited in principle by the decisions under the Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act, which we have cited and which we follow.  See also Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U. S. 381 ; <citedDecision>Currin</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wallace, supra;</citedDecision> Mulford v. Smith, supra; United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., supra; Clover Fork Coal Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 97 F. 2d 331 ; National Labor Relations Board v. Crowe Coal Co., 104 F. 2d 633 ; National Labor Relations Board v. Good Coal Co., 110 F. 2d 501 .  Our conclusion is unaffected by the Tenth Amendment which provides: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the *124 States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.  There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers.  See e. g., II Elliot’s Debates, 123, 131; III id. 450, 464, 600; IV id. 140, 149; I Annals of Congress, 432, 761, 767-768; Story, Commentaries on the Constitution, §§ 1907-1908.  From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end.  Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 324, 325 ; McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 405, 406; Gordon v. United States, 117 U. S. 697, 705 ; Lottery Case, supra; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, supra, 344-345; Everard’s Breweries v. Day, supra, 558 ; United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 733 ; see United States v. The Brigantine William, 28 Fed. Cas. No. 16,700, p. 622.  Whatever doubts may have arisen of the soundness of that conclusion, they have been put at rest by the decisions under the Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act which we have cited.
