<p id="AbD">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b859-10">In August 1965, petitioner was tried in a Maryland state court on charges of burglary and larceny. The jury found petitioner not guilty of larceny but convicted him on the burglary count. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Shortly after his notice of appeal was filed in the Maryland Court of Appeals, that court handed down its decision in the case of <em>Schowgurow </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1923184"><a href="/opinion/1923184/schowgurow-v-state/" aria-description="Citation for case: Schowgurow v.

State">Schowgurow</a></span> </em>the Maryland Court of Appeals struck down a section of the state constitution which required jurors to swear their belief in the existence of God. As a result of this decision, petitioner’s case was remanded to the trial court. <page-number citation-index="1" label="786">*786</page-number>Because both the grand and petit juries in petitioner’s case had been selected under the invalid constitutional provision, petitioner was given the option of demanding re-indictment and retrial. He chose to have his conviction set aside, and a new indictment and new trial followed. At this second trial, petitioner was again charged with both larceny and burglary. Petitioner objected to retrial on the larceny count, arguing that because the first jury had found him not guilty of larceny, retrial would violate the constitutional prohibition against subjecting persons to double jeopardy for the same offense. The trial judge denied petitioner’s motion to dismiss the larceny charge, and petitioner was tried for both larceny and burglary. This time the jury found petitioner guilty of both offenses, and the judge sentenced him to 15 years on the burglary count<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 5 years for larceny, the sentences to run concurrently. On appeal to the newly created Maryland Court of Special Appeals, petitioner’s double jeopardy claim was rejected on the merits. <span class="citation" data-id="2199601"><a href="/opinion/2199601/benton-v-state/" aria-description="Citation for case: Benton v.

<p id="b861-6">The Solicitor General was invited to file a brief expressing the views of the United States and to participate in oral argument.</p>
<p id="b861-7">After consideration of all the questions before us, we find no bar to our decision of the double jeopardy issue. On the merits, we hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, and we reverse petitioner’s conviction for larceny.</p>
<p id="b861-8">I.</p>
<p id="b861-9">At the outset of this case we are confronted with a jurisdictional problem. If the error specified in the original writ of certiorari were found to affect only petitioner’s larceny conviction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> reversal of that conviction would not require the State to change the terms of <page-number citation-index="1" label="788">*788</page-number>petitioner’s confinement. Whatever the status of his sentence on the larceny conviction, petitioner would probably stay in prison until he had served out his sentence for burglary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Is there, in these circumstances, a live “case” or “controversy” suitable for resolution by this Court, or is the issue moot? Is petitioner asking for an advisory opinion on an abstract or hypothetical question? The answer to these questions is crucial, for it is well settled that federal courts may act only in the context of a justiciable case or controversy. <em>Muskrat </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="97356"><a href="/opinion/97356/muskrat-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Muskrat v.

Cohen">392 U. S. 83, 94-97</a></span> (1968).</p>
<p id="b862-5">The language used in a number of this Court’s opinions might be read to indicate that the existence of a valid concurrent sentence removes the necessary elements of a justiciable controversy. The “concurrent sentence doctrine” took root in this country quite early, although its earliest manifestations occurred in slightly different contexts. In <em>Locke </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="85007"><a href="/opinion/85007/locke-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Locke v. United States">7 Cranch 339</a></span> (1813), a cargo belonging to the plaintiff in error had been condemned under a libel containing 11 counts. Chief Justice John Marshall, speaking for the Court, found it unnecessary to consider Locke’s challenges to all 11 counts. He declared, simply enough, “The Court however, is of opinion, that the 4th count is good, and this renders it unnecessary to decide on the others.” <span class="citation" data-id="85007"><a href="/opinion/85007/locke-v-united-states/#344" aria-description="Citation for case: Locke v. United States"><em>Id., </em>at 344</a></span>. Similar reasoning was later applied in a case where a single general sentence rested on convictions under several counts of an indictment. Drawing upon some English cases and some dicta from Lord Mansfield,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Court in <em>Claassen </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="93206"><a href="/opinion/93206/claassen-v-united-states/#146" aria-description="Citation for case: Claassen v. United States">142 U. S. 140, 146</a></span> <page-number citation-index="1" label="789">*789</page-number>(1891), held that if the defendant had validly been convicted on any one count “the other counts need not be considered.” The most widely cited application of this approach to cases where concurrent sentences, rather than a single general sentence, have been imposed is <em>Hirabayashi </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103875"><a href="/opinion/103875/hirabayashi-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Hirabayashi v. United States">320 U. S. 81</a></span> (1943). In that case the defendant had been found guilty of two different offenses and had received concurrent three-month sentences. He challenged the constitutionality of both convictions, but this Court affirmed the lower court’s judgment after considering and rejecting only one of his challenges. Since the conviction on the second count was valid, the Court found it “unnecessary” to consider the challenge to the first count. <span class="citation" data-id="103875"><a href="/opinion/103875/hirabayashi-v-united-states/#85" aria-description="Citation for case: Hirabayashi v. United States"><em>Id., </em>at 85, 105</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b863-5">The concurrent sentence doctrine has been widely, if somewhat haphazardly, applied in this Court’s decisions. At times the Court has seemed to say that the doctrine raises a jurisdictional bar to the consideration of counts under concurrent sentences. Some opinions have baldly declared that judgments of conviction “must be upheld” if any one count was good. <em>Barenblatt </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105902"><a href="/opinion/105902/barenblatt-v-united-states/#115" aria-description="Citation for case: Barenblatt v. United States">360 U. S. 109, 115</a></span> (1959); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gainey, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106988"><a href="/opinion/106988/united-states-v-gainey/#65" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Gainey">380 U. S. 63, 65</a></span> (1965). In other cases the Court has chosen somewhat weaker language, indicating only that a judgment “may be affirmed if the conviction on either count is valid.” <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105484"><a href="/opinion/105484/roviaro-v-united-states/#59" aria-description="Citation for case: Roviaro v. United States">353 U. S. 53, 59, n. 6</a></span> (1957). And on at least one occasion, the Court has ignored the rule entirely and decided an issue that affected only one count, even though there were concurrent sentences. <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="94458"><a href="/opinion/94458/putnam-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Putnam v. United States">162 U. S. 687</a></span> (1896).</p>
<p id="b863-6">One can search through these cases, and related ones, without finding any satisfactory explanation for the concurrent sentence doctrine. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hines, </em><span class="citation" data-id="245447"><a href="/opinion/245447/united-states-v-irving-hines/#562" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Irving Hines">256 F. 2d 561, 562-563</a></span> (C. A. 2d Cir. 1958). But whatever the underlying justifications for the doc<page-number citation-index="1" label="790">*790</page-number>trine, it seems clear to us that it cannot be taken to state a jurisdictional rule. See <em>Yates </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105580"><a href="/opinion/105580/yates-v-united-states/#75" aria-description="Citation for case: Yates v. United States">355 U. S. 66, 75-76</a></span> (1957); <em><span class="citation" data-id="94458"><a href="/opinion/94458/putnam-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Putnam v. United States">Putnam</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>Moreover, whatever may have been the approach in the past, our recent decisions on the question of mootness in criminal cases make it perfectly clear that the existence of concurrent sentences does not remove the elements necessary to create a justiciable case or controversy.</p>
<p id="b864-6">In <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107730"><a href="/opinion/107730/sibron-v-new-york/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sibron v. New York">392 U. S. 40</a></span> (1968), we held that a criminal case did not become moot upon the expiration of the sentence imposed. We noted “the obvious fact of life that most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal consequences.” <span class="citation" data-id="107730"><a href="/opinion/107730/sibron-v-new-york/#55" aria-description="Citation for case: Sibron v. New York"><em>Id., </em>at 55</a></span>. We concluded that the mere possibility of such collateral consequences was enough to give the case the “impact of actuality” which was necessary to make it a justiciable case or controversy. <em><span class="citation" data-id="107730"><a href="/opinion/107730/sibron-v-new-york/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sibron v. New York">Sibron</a></span> </em>and a number of other recent cases have canvassed the possible adverse collateral effects of criminal convictions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we need not repeat that analysis here. It is enough to say that there are such possibilities in this case. For example, there are a few States which consider all prior felony convictions for the purpose of enhancing sentence under habitual criminal statutes, even if the convictions actually constituted only separate counts in a single indictment tried on the same day.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner might some day in one of these States have both his larceny and burglary convictions counted against him. Although this possibility <page-number citation-index="1" label="791">*791</page-number>may well be a remote one, it is enough to give this case an adversary cast and make it justiciable. Moreover, as in <em><span class="citation" data-id="107730"><a href="/opinion/107730/sibron-v-new-york/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sibron v. New York">Sibron</a></span>, </em>both of petitioner’s convictions might some day be used to impeach his character if put in issue at a future trial. Although petitioner could explain that both convictions arose out of the same transaction, a jury might not be able to appreciate this subtlety.</p>
<p id="b865-5">We cannot, therefore, say that this Court lacks jurisdiction to decide petitioner’s challenge to his larceny conviction. It may be that in certain circumstances a federal appellate court, as a matter of discretion, might decide (as in Hirabayashi) that it is “unnecessary” to consider all the allegations made by a particular party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The concurrent sentence rule may have some continuing validity as a rule of judicial convenience. That is not a subject we must canvass today, however. It is sufficient for present purposes to hold that there is no jurisdictional bar to consideration of challenges to multiple convictions, even though concurrent sentences were imposed.</p>
<p id="b865-6">II.</p>
<p id="b865-7">While Maryland apparently agrees that there is no jurisdictional bar to consideration of petitioner’s larceny conviction, it argues that the possibility of collateral consequences is so remote in this case that any double jeopardy violation should be treated as a species of “harmless error.” The Solicitor General, while not commenting at length on the facts of this particular case, <page-number citation-index="1" label="792">*792</page-number>suggests that we treat the concurrent sentence doctrine as a principle of judicial efficiency which permits judges to avoid decision of issues which have no appreciable impact on the rights of any party. Both Maryland and the Solicitor General argue that the defendant should bear the burden of convincing the appellate court of the need to review all his concurrent sentences. Petitioner, on the other hand, sees in <em><span class="citation" data-id="107730"><a href="/opinion/107730/sibron-v-new-york/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sibron v. New York">Sibron</a></span> </em>a command that federal appellate courts treat all errors which may possibly affect a defendant’s rights, and he argues that the concurrent sentence rule therefore has no continuing validity, even as a rule of convenience.</p>
<p id="b866-5">Because of the special circumstances in this case, we find it unnecessary to resolve this dispute. For even if the concurrent sentence doctrine survives as a rule of judicial convenience, we find good reason not to apply it here. On direct appeal from petitioner’s conviction, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals did in fact rule on his double jeopardy challenge to the larceny count. <span class="citation" data-id="2199601"><a href="/opinion/2199601/benton-v-state/#650" aria-description="Citation for case: Benton v. State">1 Md. App., at 650-651</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="2199601"><a href="/opinion/2199601/benton-v-state/#542" aria-description="Citation for case: Benton v. State">232 A. 2d, at 542-543</a></span>. It is unclear whether Maryland courts always consider all challenges raised on direct appeal, notwithstanding the existence of concurrent sentences,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but at least in this case the State decided not to apply the concurrent sentence rule. This may well indicate that the State has some interest in keeping the larceny conviction alive;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> if, as Maryland argues here, the larceny conviction is of no importance to either party, one wonders why the state courts found it necessary to pass on it. Since the future importance of the conviction may well turn on issues of state law about which we are not well informed, we propose, on direct appeal from the Maryland courts, to accept their judgment on this question. Since <page-number citation-index="1" label="793">*793</page-number>they decided this federal constitutional question, we see no reason why we should not do so as well. Moreover, the status of petitioner’s burglary conviction and the eventual length of his sentence are both still in some doubt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Should any attack on the burglary conviction be successful, or should the length of the burglary sentence be reduced to less than five years, petitioner would then clearly have a right to have his larceny conviction reviewed. As we said in <em><span class="citation" data-id="107730"><a href="/opinion/107730/sibron-v-new-york/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sibron v. New York">Sibron</a></span> </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>at 56-57, it is certainly preferable to have that review now on direct appeal, rather than later.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For these reasons, and because there is no jurisdictional bar, we find it appropriate to reach the questions specified in our original writ of certiorari.</p>
<p id="b867-5">III.</p>
<p id="b867-6">In 1937, this Court decided the landmark case of <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102879"><a href="/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Palko v. Connecticut">302 U. S. 319</a></span>. Palko, although indicted for first-degree murder, had been convicted of murder in the second degree after a jury trial in a Connecticut state court. The State appealed and won a new trial. Palko argued that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated, as against the States, the Fifth Amendment requirement that no person “be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” The Court disagreed. Federal double jeopardy standards were not applicable against the States. Only when a kind of jeopardy subjected a defendant to “a hardship so acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it,” <span class="citation" data-id="102879"><a href="/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/#328" aria-description="Citation for case: Palko v. Connecticut"><em>id., </em>at 328</a></span>, did the Fourteenth Amendment apply. The order <page-number citation-index="1" label="794">*794</page-number>for a new trial was affirmed. In subsequent appeals from state courts, the Court continued to apply this lesser <em><span class="citation" data-id="102879"><a href="/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Palko v. Connecticut">Palko</a></span> </em>standard.

As with many other elements of the common law, it was carried into the jurisprudence of this Country through the medium of Blackstone, who codified the doctrine in his Commentaries. “[T]he plea of <em>autrefoits acquit, </em>or a former acquittal,” he wrote, “is grounded on this universal maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life more than once for the same offence.” <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Today, every State incorporates some form of the prohibition in its constitution or common law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As this Court put it in <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105594"><a href="/opinion/105594/green-v-united-states/#187" aria-description="Citation for case: Green v. United States">355 U. S. 184, 187-188</a></span> (1957), “[t]he underlying <page-number citation-index="1" label="796">*796</page-number>idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.” This underlying notion has from the very beginning been part of our constitutional tradition. Like the right to trial by jury, it is clearly “fundamental to the American scheme of justice.” The validity of petitioner’s larceny conviction must be judged, not by the watered-down standard enunciated in <em><span class="citation" data-id="102879"><a href="/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Palko v. Connecticut">Palko</a></span>, </em>but under this Court’s interpretations of the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy provision.</p>
<p id="b870-6">IV.</p>
<p id="b870-7">It is clear that petitioner’s larceny conviction cannot stand once federal double jeopardy standards are applied. Petitioner was acquitted of larceny in his first trial. Because he decided to appeal his burglary conviction, he is forced to suffer retrial on the larceny count as well. As this Court held in <em><span class="citation" data-id="105594"><a href="/opinion/105594/green-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Green v. United States">Green</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 193— 194, “[conditioning an appeal of one offense on a coerced surrender of a valid plea of former jeopardy on another offense exacts a forfeiture in plain conflict with the constitutional bar against double jeopardy.”</p>
<p id="b870-8">Maryland argues that <em><span class="citation" data-id="105594"><a href="/opinion/105594/green-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Green v. United States">Green</a></span> </em>does not apply to this case because petitioner’s original indictment was absolutely void. One cannot be placed in “jeopardy” by a void indictment, the State argues. This argument sounds a bit strange, however, since petitioner could quietly have served out his sentence under this “void” indictment had he not appealed his burglary conviction. Only by accepting the option of a new trial could the in<page-number citation-index="1" label="797">*797</page-number>dictment be set aside; at worst the indictment would seem only voidable at the defendant’s option, not absolutely void. In any case, this argument was answered here over 70 years ago in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ball, </em><span class="citation" data-id="94515"><a href="/opinion/94515/united-states-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ball">163 U. S. 662</a></span> (1896). In that case Millard Fillmore Ball was indicted, together with two other men, for the murder of one William T. Box in the Indian Territory. He was acquitted and his codefendants were convicted. They appealed and won a reversal on the ground that the indictment erroneously failed to aver the time or place of Box’s death. All three defendants were retried, and this time Ball was convicted. This Court sustained his double jeopardy claim, notwithstanding the technical invalidity of the indictment upon which he was first tried. The Court refused to allow the Government to allege its own error to deprive the defendant of the benefit of an acquittal by a jury. <span class="citation" data-id="94515"><a href="/opinion/94515/united-states-v-ball/#667" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ball"><em>Id., </em>at 667-668</a></span>. “ [A] lthough the indictment was fatally defective, yet, if the court had jurisdiction of the cause and of the party, its judgment is not void, but only voidable by writ of error . . . ,” and the Government could not have the acquittal set aside over the defendant’s objections. <span class="citation" data-id="94515"><a href="/opinion/94515/united-states-v-ball/#669" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ball"><em>Id., </em>at 669-670</a></span>. This case is totally indistinguishable. Petitioner was acquitted of larceny. He has, under <em><span class="citation" data-id="105594"><a href="/opinion/105594/green-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Green v. United States">Green</a></span>, </em>a valid double jeopardy plea which he cannot be forced to waive. Yet Maryland wants the earlier acquittal set aside, over petitioner’s objections, because of a defect in the indictment. This it cannot do. Petitioner’s larceny conviction cannot stand.</p>
<p id="b871-4">Y.</p>
<p id="b871-5">Petitioner argues that his burglary conviction should be set aside as well. He contends that some evidence, inadmissible under state law in a trial for burglary alone, was introduced in the joint trial for both burglary and larceny, and that the jury was prejudiced by this evi<page-number citation-index="1" label="798">*798</page-number>dence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This question was not decided by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals because it found no double jeopardy violation at all. It is not obvious on the face of the record that the burglary conviction was affected by the double jeopardy violation. To determine whether there is in fact any such evidentiary error, we would have to explore the Maryland law of evidence and the Maryland definitions of larceny and burglary, and then examine the record in detail. We do not think that this is the kind of determination we should make unaided by prior consideration by the state courts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, we think it “just under the circumstances,” <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. § 2106</span>, to vacate the judgment below and remand for consideration of this question. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
