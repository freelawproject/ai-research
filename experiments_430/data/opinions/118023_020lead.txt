<p id="b587-4">Last Term we held that a federal law abridging a brewer’s right to provide the public with accurate information about the alcoholic content of malt beverages is unconstitutional. <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Coors Brewing Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="117924"><a href="/opinion/117924/rubin-v-coors-brewing-co/#491" aria-description="Citation for case: Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.">514 U. S. 476, 491</a></span> (1995). We now hold that Rhode Island’s statutory prohibition against advertisements that provide the public with accurate information about retail prices of alcoholic beverages is also invalid. Our holding rests on the conclusion that such an advertising ban is an abridgment of speech protected by the First Amendment and that it is not shielded from constitutional scrutiny by the Twenty-first Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b587-5">I</p>
<p id="b587-6">In 1956, the Rhode Island Legislature enacted two separate prohibitions against advertising the retail price of alcoholic beverages. The first applies to vendors licensed in Rhode Island as well as to out-of-state manufacturers, wholesalers, and shippers. It prohibits them from “advertising in any manner whatsoever” the price of any alcoholic beverage offered for sale in the State; the only exception is for price tags or signs displayed with the merchandise within licensed premises and not visible from the street.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second stat<page-number citation-index="1" label="490">*490</page-number>ute applies to the Rhode Island news media. It contains a categorical prohibition against the publication or broadcast of any advertisements — even those referring to sales in other States — that “make reference to the price of any alcoholic beverages.”<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b588-4">In two cases decided in 1985, the Rhode Island Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of these two statutes. In <em>S&amp;S Liquor Mart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pastore, </em><span class="citation" data-id="2088756"><a href="/opinion/2088756/s-s-liquor-mart-inc-v-pastore/" aria-description="Citation for case: S &amp; S Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Pastore">497 A. 2d 729</a></span>, a liquor retailer located in Westerly, Rhode Island, a town that borders the State of Connecticut, having been advised that his license would be revoked if he advertised his prices in a Connecticut paper, sought to enjoin enforcement of the first statute. Over the dissent of one justice, the court upheld the statute. It concluded that the statute served the substantial state interest in “‘the promotion of temperance.’”<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <span class="citation" data-id="2088756"><a href="/opinion/2088756/s-s-liquor-mart-inc-v-pastore/#737" aria-description="Citation for case: S &amp; S Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Pastore"><em>Id., </em>at <page-number citation-index="1" label="491">*491</page-number>737</a></span>. Because the plaintiff failed to prove that the statute did not serve that interest, the court held that he had not carried his burden of establishing a violation of the First Amendment. In response to the dissent’s argument that the court had placed the burden on the wrong party, the majority reasoned that the Twenty-first Amendment gave the statute “‘an added presumption [of] validity.’” <span class="citation" data-id="2088756"><a href="/opinion/2088756/s-s-liquor-mart-inc-v-pastore/#732" aria-description="Citation for case: S &amp; S Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Pastore"><em>Id., </em>at 732</a></span>. Although that presumption had not been overcome in that case, the State Supreme Court assumed that in a future case the record might “support the proposition that these advertising restrictions do not further temperance objectives.” <span class="citation" data-id="2088756"><a href="/opinion/2088756/s-s-liquor-mart-inc-v-pastore/#734" aria-description="Citation for case: S &amp; S Liquor Mart, Inc. v.

<p id="b589-5">In <em>Rhode Island Liquor Stores Assn. </em>v. <em>Evening Call Pub.

In upholding the injunction, the <page-number citation-index="1" label="492">*492</page-number>State Supreme Court adhered to its reasoning in the <em><span class="citation" data-id="2088756"><a href="/opinion/2088756/s-s-liquor-mart-inc-v-pastore/" aria-description="Citation for case: S &amp; S Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Pastore">Pastore</a></span> </em>case and rejected the argument that the statute neither “directly advanced” the state interest in promoting temperance, nor was “more extensive than necessary to serve that interest” as required by this Court’s decision in <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Comm’n of N.

It assumed the existence of other, “perhaps more effective means” of achieving the State’s “goal of temperance,” but concluded that it was “not unreasonable for the State of Rhode Island to believe that price advertising will result in increased sales of alcoholic beverages generally.” <em>Rhode Island Liquor Stores Assn. </em>v. <em>Evening Call Pub.

<p id="b590-4">II</p>
<p id="b590-5">Petitioners 44 Liquormart, Inc. (44 Liquormart), and Peoples Super Liquor Stores, Inc. (Peoples), are licensed retailers of alcoholic beverages. Petitioner 44 Liquormart operates a store in Rhode Island and petitioner Peoples operates several stores in Massachusetts that are patronized by Rhode Island residents. Peoples uses alcohol price advertising extensively in Massachusetts, where such advertising is permitted, but Rhode Island newspapers and other media outlets have refused to accept such ads.</p>
<p id="b590-6">Complaints from competitors about an advertisement placed by 44 Liquormart in a Rhode Island newspaper in 1991 generated enforcement proceedings that in turn led to the initiation of this litigation. The advertisement did not state the price of any alcoholic beverages. Indeed, it noted that “State law prohibits advertising liquor prices.” The ad did, however, state the low prices at which peanuts, potato chips, and Schweppes mixers were being offered, identify various brands of packaged liquor, and include the word “WOW” in large letters next to pictures of vodka and rum bottles. Based on the conclusion that the implied reference to bargain prices for liquor violated the statutory ban on <page-number citation-index="1" label="493">*493</page-number>price advertising, the Rhode Island Liquor Control Administrator assessed a $400 fine.</p>
<p id="b591-5">After paying the fine, 44 Liquormart, joined by Peoples, filed this action against the administrator in the Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the two statutes and the administrator’s implementing regulations violate the First Amendment and other provisions of federal law. The Rhode Island Liquor Stores Association was allowed to intervene as a defendant and in due course the State of Rhode Island replaced the administrator as the principal defendant. The parties stipulated that the price advertising ban is vigorously enforced, that Rhode Island permits “all advertising of alcoholic beverages excepting references to price outside the licensed premises,” and that petitioners’ proposed ads do not concern an illegal activity and presumably would not be false or misleading. <em>44 Liquor Mart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Racine, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1877168"><a href="/opinion/1877168/44-liquor-mart-inc-v-racine/#545" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine">829 F. Supp. 543, 545</a></span> (RI 1993). The parties disagreed, however, about the impact of the ban on the promotion of temperance in Rhode Island. On that question the District Court heard conflicting expert testimony and reviewed a number of studies.</p>
<p id="b591-6">In his findings of fact, the District Judge first noted that there was a pronounced lack of unanimity among researchers who have studied the impact of advertising on the level of consumption of alcoholic beverages. He referred to a 1985 Federal Trade Commission study that found no evidence that alcohol advertising significantly affects alcohol abuse. Another study indicated that Rhode Island ranks in the upper 30% of States in per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages; alcohol consumption is lower in other States that allow price advertising. After summarizing the testimony of the expert witnesses for both parties, he found “as a fact that Rhode Island’s off-premises liquor price advertising ban has no significant impact on levels of alcohol consumption in Rhode Island.” <span class="citation" data-id="1877168"><a href="/opinion/1877168/44-liquor-mart-inc-v-racine/#549" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine"><em>Id., </em>at 549</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b592-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="494">*494</page-number>As a matter of law, he concluded that the price advertising ban was unconstitutional because it did not “directly advance” the State’s interest in reducing alcohol consumption and was “more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.” <span class="citation" data-id="1877168"><a href="/opinion/1877168/44-liquor-mart-inc-v-racine/#555" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine"><em>Id., </em>at 555</a></span>. He reasoned that the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it and that the Twenty-first Amendment did not shift or diminish that burden. Acknowledging that it might have been reasonable for the state legislature to “assume a correlation between the price advertising ban and reduced consumption,” he held that more than a rational basis was required to justify the speech restriction, and that the State had failed to demonstrate a reasonable “‘fit’” between its policy objectives and its chosen means. <em><span class="citation" data-id="1877168"><a href="/opinion/1877168/44-liquor-mart-inc-v-racine/" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v.

<p id="b592-5">The Court of Appeals reversed. <span class="citation" data-id="195687"><a href="/opinion/195687/44-liquormart-inc-v-rhode-island/" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquormart, Inc. v.

It found “inherent merit” in the State’s submission that competitive price advertising would lower prices and that lower prices would produce more sales. <span class="citation" data-id="195687"><a href="/opinion/195687/44-liquormart-inc-v-rhode-island/#7" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island"><em>Id., </em>at 7</a></span>. Moreover, it agreed with the reasoning of the Rhode Island Supreme Court that the Twenty-first Amendment gave the statutes an added presumption of validity. <span class="citation" data-id="195687"><a href="/opinion/195687/44-liquormart-inc-v-rhode-island/#8" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island"><em>Id., </em>at 8</a></span>. Alternatively, it concluded that reversal was compelled by this Court’s summary action in <em>Queensgate Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Comm’n of Ohio, </em><span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./459/807/">459 U.

Rhode Island">39 F. 3d, at 8</a></span>. In that case the Court dismissed the appeal from a decision of the Ohio Supreme Court upholding a prohibition against off-premises advertising of the prices of alcoholic beverages sold by the drink. See <em>Queensgate Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Comm’n of Ohio, </em><span class="citation" data-id="6757516"><a href="/opinion/6866979/queensgate-investment-co-v-liquor-control-commission/" aria-description="Citation for case: Queensgate Investment Co. v.

<p id="b592-6"><em>Queensgate </em>has been both followed and distinguished in subsequent cases reviewing the validity of similar advertising bans.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are now persuaded that the importance of <page-number citation-index="1" label="495">*495</page-number>the First Amendment issue, as well the suggested relevance of the Twenty-first Amendment, merits more thorough analysis than it received when we refused to accept jurisdiction of the <em>Queensgate </em>appeal.

<p id="b593-6">Advertising has been a part of our culture throughout our history. Even in colonial days, the public relied on “commercial speech” for vital information about the market. Early newspapers displayed advertisements for goods and services on their front pages, and town criers called out prices in public squares. See J. Wood, The Story of Advertising 21, 45-69, 85 (1958); J. Smith, Printers and Press Freedom 49 (1988). Indeed, commercial messages played such a central role in public life prior to the founding that Benjamin Franklin authored his early defense of a free press in support of his decision to print, of all things, an advertisement for voyages to Barbados. Franklin, An Apology for Print<page-number citation-index="1" label="496">*496</page-number>ers, June 10, 1731, reprinted in 2 Writings of Benjamin Franklin 172 (1907).</p>
<p id="b594-4">In accord with the role that commercial messages have long played, the law has developed to ensure that advertising provides consumers with accurate information about the availability of goods and services. In the early years, the common law, and later, statutes, served the consumers’ interest in the receipt of accurate information in the commercial market by prohibiting fraudulent and misleading advertising. It was not until the 1970’s, however, that this Court held that the First Amendment protected the dissemination of truthful and nonmisleading commercial messages about lawful products and services. See generally Kozinski &amp; Banner, The Anti-History and Pre-History of Commercial Speech, 71 Texas L. Rev. 747 (1993).</p>
<p id="b594-5">In <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109271"><a href="/opinion/109271/bigelow-v-virginia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bigelow v.

<p id="b594-6"><em><span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens...">Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy</a></span> </em>reflected the conclusion that the same interest that supports regulation of potentially misleading advertising, namely, the public’s interest in receiving accurate commercial information, also supports an interpretation of the First Amendment that provides constitutional protection for the dissemination of accurate and nonmis-leading commercial messages. We explained:</p>
<blockquote id="b594-7">“Advertising, however tasteless and excessive it sometimes may seem, is nonetheless dissemination of information as to who is producing and selling what product, for what reason, and at what price. So long as we pre<page-number citation-index="1" label="497">*497</page-number>serve a predominantly free enterprise economy, the allocation of our resources in large measure will be made through numerous private economic decisions. It is a matter of public interest that those decisions, in the aggregate, be intelligent and well informed. To this end, the free flow of commercial information is indispensable.” <span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/#765" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens...">425 U. S., at 765</a></span>.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>
<p id="b595-5">The opinion further explained that a State’s paternalistic assumption that the public will use truthful, nonmisleading commercial information unwisely cannot justify a decision to suppress it:</p>
<blockquote id="b595-6">“There is, of course, an alternative to this highly paternalistic approach. That alternative is to assume that this information is not in itself harmful, that people will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough informed, and that the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication rather than to close them. If they are truly open, nothing prevents the ‘professional’ pharmacist from marketing his own as-sertedly superior product, and contrasting it with that of the low-cost, high-volume prescription drug retailer. But the choice among these alternative approaches is not ours to make or the Virginia General Assembly’s. It is precisely this kind of choice, between the dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available, that the. First Amendment makes for us.” <span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/#770" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens..."><em>Id., </em>at 770</a></span>.</blockquote>
<p id="b595-7">On the basis of these principles, our early cases uniformly struck down several broadly based bans on truthful, nonmis-leading commercial speech, each of which served ends unre<page-number citation-index="1" label="498">*498</page-number>lated to consumer protection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, one of those cases expressly likened the rationale that <em><span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v.

Only an emergency can justify repression.” <em>Whitney, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101097"><a href="/opinion/101097/whitney-v-california/#377" aria-description="Citation for case: Whitney v.

<p id="b596-4">At the same time, our early cases recognized that the State may regulate some types of commercial advertising more freely than other forms of protected speech. Specifically, we explained that the State may require commercial messages to “appear in such a form, or include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers, as are necessary to prevent its being deceptive,” <em>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/#772" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v.

Our opinion noted that the greater “objectivity” of commercial speech justifies affording the State more freedom to distinguish false commercial advertisements from true ones, <em>ibid., </em>and that the greater “hardiness” of commercial speech, inspired as it is by the profit motive, likely diminishes the chilling effect that may attend its regulation, <em><span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v.

<p id="b597-5">Subsequent cases explained that the State’s power to regulate commercial transactions justifies its concomitant power to regulate commercial speech that is “linked inextricably” to those transactions. <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110015"><a href="/opinion/110015/friedman-v-rogers/#10" aria-description="Citation for case: Friedman v.

As one commentator has explained: “The entire commercial speech doctrine, after all, represents an accommodation between the right to speak and hear expression <em>about </em>goods and services and the right of government to regulate the sales <em>of </em>such goods and services.” L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 12-15, p. 903 (2d ed. 1988). Nevertheless, as we explained in <em>Lin-mark, </em>the State retains less regulatory authority when its commercial speech restrictions strike at “the substance of the information communicated” rather than the “commercial aspect of [it] — with offerors communicating offers to offer-ees.” 431 U.

Nevertheless, they concluded that the regulation was invalid because respondent commission had failed to make a showing that a more limited speech regulation would not have adequately served the State’s interest. <span class="citation" data-id="110312"><a href="/opinion/110312/central-hudson-gas-electric-corp-v-public-service-commission/#571" aria-description="Citation for case: Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v.

<p id="b598-5">In reaching its conclusion, the majority explained that although the special nature of commercial speech may require less than strict review of its regulation, special concerns arise from “regulations that entirely suppress commercial speech in order to pursue a nonspeech-related policy.” <span class="citation" data-id="110312"><a href="/opinion/110312/central-hudson-gas-electric-corp-v-public-service-commission/#566" aria-description="Citation for case: Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v.

<p id="ARo">As our review of the case law reveals, Rhode Island errs in concluding that <em>all </em>commercial speech regulations are subject to a similar form of constitutional review simply because they target a similar category of expression. The mere fact that messages propose commercial transactions does not in and of itself dictate the constitutional analysis that should apply to decisions to suppress them. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="117924"><a href="/opinion/117924/rubin-v-coors-brewing-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.">Rubin</a></span> </em>v. <em>Coors Brewing Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="117924"><a href="/opinion/117924/rubin-v-coors-brewing-co/#491" aria-description="Citation for case: Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.">514 U. S., at 491-494</a></span> (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).</p>
<p id="A-E">When a State regulates commercial messages to protect consumers from misleading, deceptive, or aggressive sales practices, or requires the disclosure of beneficial consumer information, the purpose of its regulation is consistent with the reasons for according constitutional protection to commercial speech and therefore justifies less than strict review. However, when a State entirely prohibits the dissemination of truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of a fair bargaining process, there is far less reason to depart from the rigorous review that the First Amendment generally demands.</p>
<p id="ACF">Sound reasons justify reviewing the latter type of commercial speech regulation more carefully. Most obviously, complete speech bans, unlike content-neutral restrictions on the time, place, or manner of expression, see <em>Kovacs </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104623"><a href="/opinion/104623/kovacs-v-cooper/#89" aria-description="Citation for case: Kovacs v. Cooper">336 U. S. 77, 89</a></span> (1949), are particularly dangerous because they all but foreclose alternative means of disseminating certain information.</p>
<p id="AEWT">Our commercial speech cases have recognized the dangers that attend governmental attempts to single out certain messages for suppression. For example, in <em>Linmark, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109649"><a href="/opinion/109649/linmark-associates-inc-v-township-of-willingboro/#92" aria-description="Citation for case: Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Township of Willingboro">431 U. S., at 92-94</a></span>, we concluded that a ban on “For Sale” signs <page-number citation-index="1" label="502">*502</page-number>was “content based” and failed to leave open “satisfactory” alternative channels of communication; see also <em>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/#771" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens...">425 U. S., at 771</a></span>. Moreover, last Term we upheld a 30-day prohibition against a certain form of legal solicitation largely because it left so many channels of communication open to Florida lawyers. <em>Florida Bar </em>v. <em>Went For It, Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="117963"><a href="/opinion/117963/florida-bar-v-went-for-it-inc/#633" aria-description="Citation for case: Florida Bar v.

<p id="b600-5">The special dangers that attend complete bans on truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech cannot be explained away by appeals to the “commonsense distinctions” that exist between commercial and noncommercial speech. <em>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/#771" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens...">425 U. S., at 771, n. 24</a></span>. Regulations that suppress the truth are no less troubling because they target objectively verifiable information, nor are they less effective because they aim at durable messages. As a result, neither the “greater objectivity” nor the “greater hardiness” of truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech justifies reviewing its complete suppression with added deference. <em><span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens...">Ibid.</a></span></em></p>
<p id="b600-6">It is the State’s interest in protecting consumers from “commercial harms” that provides “the typical reason why commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial speech.” <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Discovery Network, Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="112836"><a href="/opinion/112836/city-of-cincinnati-v-discovery-network-inc/#426" aria-description="Citation for case: City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc.">507 U. S. 410, 426</a></span> (1993). Yet bans <page-number citation-index="1" label="503">*503</page-number>that target truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages rarely protect consumers from such harms.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Instead, such bans often serve only to obscure an “underlying governmental policy” that could be implemented without regulating speech. <em>Central Hudson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110312"><a href="/opinion/110312/central-hudson-gas-electric-corp-v-public-service-commission/#566" aria-description="Citation for case: Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service...">447 U. S., at 566, n. 9</a></span>. In this way, these commercial speech bans not only hinder consumer choice, but also impede debate over central issues of public policy. See <span class="citation" data-id="110312"><a href="/opinion/110312/central-hudson-gas-electric-corp-v-public-service-commission/#575" aria-description="Citation for case: Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v.

<p id="b601-5">Precisely because bans against truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech rarely seek to protect consumers from either deception or overreaching, they usually rest solely on the offensive assumption that the public will respond “irrationally” to the truth. <em>Linmark, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109649"><a href="/opinion/109649/linmark-associates-inc-v-township-of-willingboro/#96" aria-description="Citation for case: Linmark Associates, Inc. v.

The First Amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good. That teaching applies equally to state attempts to deprive consumers of accurate information about their chosen products:</p>

<p id="b602-6">In this- case, there is no question that Rhode Island’s price advertising ban constitutes a blanket prohibition against truthful, nonmisleading speech about a lawful product. There is also no question that the ban serves an end unrelated to consumer protection. Accordingly, we must review the price advertising ban with “special care,” <em>Central Hudson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110312"><a href="/opinion/110312/central-hudson-gas-electric-corp-v-public-service-commission/#566" aria-description="Citation for case: Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v.

Public Service...">ibid.</a></span></em></p>
<p id="b602-7">The State argues that the price advertising prohibition should nevertheless be upheld because it directly advances the State’s substantial interest in promoting temperance, and because it is no more extensive than necessary. Cf. <span class="citation" data-id="110312"><a href="/opinion/110312/central-hudson-gas-electric-corp-v-public-service-commission/#566" aria-description="Citation for case: Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service..."><em>id., </em>at 566</a></span>. Although there is some confusion as to what Rhode Island means by temperance, we assume that the State asserts an interest in reducing alcohol consumption.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b603-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="505">*505</page-number>In evaluating the ban’s effectiveness in advancing the State’s interest, we note that a commercial speech regulation “may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government’s purpose.” <span class="citation" data-id="110312"><a href="/opinion/110312/central-hudson-gas-electric-corp-v-public-service-commission/#564" aria-description="Citation for case: Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service..."><em>Id., </em>at 564</a></span>. For that reason, the State bears the burden of showing not merely that its regulation will advance its interest, but also that it will do so “to a material degree.” <em>Edenfield, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112850"><a href="/opinion/112850/edenfield-v-fane/#771" aria-description="Citation for case: Edenfield v.

Coors Brewing Co.">514 U. S., at 486-488</a></span>. The need for the State to make such a showing is particularly great given the drastic nature of its chosen means — the wholesale suppression of truthful, non-misleading information. Accordingly, we must determine whether the State has shown that the price advertising ban will <em>significantly </em>reduce alcohol consumption.</p>
<p id="b603-5">We can agree that common sense supports the conclusion that a prohibition against price advertising, like a collusive agreement among competitors to refrain from such advertising,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> will tend to mitigate competition and maintain prices at a higher level than would prevail in a completely free market. Despite the absence of proof on the point, we can even agree with the State’s contention that it is reasonable to assume that demand, and hence consumption throughout the market, is somewhat lower whenever a higher, noncompetitive price level prevails. However, without any findings of fact, or indeed any evidentiary support whatsoever, we cannot agree with the assertion that the price advertising ban will significantly advance the State’s interest in promoting temperance.</p>
<p id="b604-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="506">*506</page-number>Although the record suggests that the price advertising ban may have some impact on the purchasing patterns of temperate drinkers of modest means, <span class="citation" data-id="1877168"><a href="/opinion/1877168/44-liquor-mart-inc-v-racine/#546" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine">829 F. Supp., at 546</a></span>, the State has presented no evidence to suggest that its speech prohibition will <em>significantly </em>reduce marketwide consumption.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, the District Court’s considered and un-contradicted finding on this point is directly to the contrary. <span class="citation" data-id="1877168"><a href="/opinion/1877168/44-liquor-mart-inc-v-racine/#549" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine"><em>Id., </em>at 549</a></span>.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, the evidence suggests that the abusive drinker will probably not be deterred by a marginal price increase, and that the true alcoholic may simply reduce his purchases of other necessities.</p>
<p id="b604-5">In addition, as the District Court noted, the State has not identified what price level would lead to a significant reduction in alcohol consumption, nor has it identified the amount <page-number citation-index="1" label="507">*507</page-number>that it believes prices would decrease without the ban. <em><span class="citation" data-id="1877168"><a href="/opinion/1877168/44-liquor-mart-inc-v-racine/" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine">Ibid.</a></span> </em>Thus, the State’s own showing reveals that any connection between the ban and a significant change in alcohol consumption would be purely fortuitous.</p>
<p id="b605-5">As is evident, any conclusion that elimination of the ban would significantly increase alcohol consumption would require us to engage in the sort of “speculation or conjecture” that is an unacceptable means of demonstrating that a restriction on commercial speech directly advances the State’s asserted interest. <em>Edenfield, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112850"><a href="/opinion/112850/edenfield-v-fane/#770" aria-description="Citation for case: Edenfield v. Fane">507 U. S., at 770</a></span>.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Such speculation certainly does not suffice when the State takes aim at accurate commercial information for paternalistic ends.</p>
<p id="b605-6">The State also cannot satisfy the requirement that its restriction on speech be no more extensive than necessary. It is perfectly obvious that alternative forms of regulation that would not involve any restriction on speech would be more likely to achieve the State’s goal of promoting temperance. As the State’s own expert conceded, higher prices can be maintained either by direct regulation or by increased taxation. <span class="citation" data-id="1877168"><a href="/opinion/1877168/44-liquor-mart-inc-v-racine/#549" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine">829 F. Supp., at 549</a></span>. Per capita purchases could be limited as is the case with prescription drugs. Even educational campaigns focused on the problems of excessive, or even moderate, drinking might prove to be more effective.</p>
<p id="b605-7">As a result, even under the less than strict standard that generally applies in commercial speech cases, the State has failed to establish a “reasonable fit” between its abridgment of speech and its temperance goal. <em>Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N.

<p id="b606-6">The State responds by arguing that it merely exercised appropriate “legislative judgment” in determining that a price advertising ban would best promote temperance. Relying on the <em>Central Hudson </em>analysis set forth in <em>Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates </em>v. <em>Tourism Co. of P. R., </em><span class="citation" data-id="111744"><a href="/opinion/111744/posadas-de-puerto-rico-associates-v-tourism-co-of-puerto-rico/" aria-description="Citation for case: Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v.

Edge Broadcasting Co.">509 U. S. 418</a></span> (1993), Rhode Island first argues that, because expert opinions as to the effectiveness of the price advertising ban “go both ways,” the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the ban constituted a “reasonable choice” by the legislature. <span class="citation" data-id="195687"><a href="/opinion/195687/44-liquormart-inc-v-rhode-island/#7" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island">39 F. 3d, at 7</a></span>. The State next contends that precedent requires us to give particular deference to that legislative choice because the State could, if it chose, ban the sale of alcoholic beverages outright. See <em>Posadas, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111744"><a href="/opinion/111744/posadas-de-puerto-rico-associates-v-tourism-co-of-puerto-rico/#345" aria-description="Citation for case: Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of...">478 U. S., at 345-346</a></span>. Finally, the State argues that deference is appropriate because alcoholic beverages are so-called “vice” products. See <em>Edge, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112899"><a href="/opinion/112899/united-states-v-edge-broadcasting-co/#426" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

Tourism Co. of...">478 U. S., at 346-347</a></span>. We consider each of these contentions in turn.</p>
<p id="b606-7">The State’s first argument fails to justify the speech prohibition at issue. Our commercial speech cases recognize some room for the exercise of legislative judgment. See <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Diego, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110561"><a href="/opinion/110561/metromedia-inc-v-city-of-san-diego/#507" aria-description="Citation for case: Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego">453 U. S. 490, 507-508</a></span> (1981). However, Rhode Island errs in concluding that <em>Edge </em>and <page-number citation-index="1" label="509">*509</page-number><em>Posadas </em>establish the degree of deference that its decision to impose a price advertising ban warrants.</p>
<p id="b607-5">In <em>Edge, </em>we upheld a federal statute that permitted only those broadcasters located in States that had legalized lotteries to air lottery advertising. The statute was designed to regulate advertising about an activity that had been deemed illegal in the jurisdiction in which the broadcaster was located. <span class="citation" data-id="112899"><a href="/opinion/112899/united-states-v-edge-broadcasting-co/#433" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co.">509 U. S., at 433-434</a></span>. Here, by contrast, the commercial speech ban targets information about entirely lawful behavior.</p>
<p id="b607-6"><em>Posadas </em>is more directly relevant. There, a flve-Member majority held that, under the <em>Central Hudson </em>test, it was “up to the legislature” to choose to reduce gambling by suppressing in-state casino advertising rather than engaging in educational speech. <em>Posadas, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111744"><a href="/opinion/111744/posadas-de-puerto-rico-associates-v-tourism-co-of-puerto-rico/#344" aria-description="Citation for case: Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of...">478 U. S., at 344</a></span>. Rhode Island argues that this logic demonstrates the constitutionality of its own decision to ban price advertising in lieu of raising-taxes or employing some other less speech-restrictive means of promoting temperance.</p>
<p id="b607-7">The reasoning in <em>Posadas </em>does support the State’s argument, but, on reflection, we are now persuaded that <em>Posadas </em>erroneously performed the First Amendment analysis. The casino advertising ban was designed to keep truthful, non-misleading speech from members of the public for fear that they would be more likely to gamble if they received it. As a result, the advertising ban served to shield the State’s anti-gambling policy from the public scrutiny that more direct, nonspeech regulation would draw. See <span class="citation" data-id="111744"><a href="/opinion/111744/posadas-de-puerto-rico-associates-v-tourism-co-of-puerto-rico/#351" aria-description="Citation for case: Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of..."><em>id., </em>at 351</a></span> (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>
<p id="b607-8">Given our longstanding hostility to commercial speech regulation of this type, <em>Posadas </em>clearly erred in concluding that it was “up to the legislature” to choose suppression over a less speech-restrictive policy. The <em>Posadas </em>majority’s conclusion on that point cannot be reconciled with the unbroken line of prior eases striking down similarly broad regulations on truthful, nonmisleading advertising when non-speech-<page-number citation-index="1" label="510">*510</page-number>related alternatives were available.

<p id="b608-5">Because the 5-to-4 decision in <em>Posadas </em>marked such a sharp break from our prior precedent, and because it concerned a constitutional question about which this Court is the final arbiter, we decline to give force to its highly deferential approach. Instead, in keeping with our prior holdings, we conclude that a state legislature does not have the broad discretion to suppress truthful, nonmisleading information for paternalistic purposes that the <em>Posadas </em>majority was willing to tolerate. As we explained in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens...">Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy</a></span>, </em>“[i]t is precisely this kind of choice, between the dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available, that the First Amendment makes for us.” <span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/#770" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens...">425 U. S., at 770</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b608-6">We also cannot accept the State’s second contention, which is premised entirely on the “greater-includes-the-lesser” reasoning endorsed toward the end of the majority’s opinion in <em>Posadas. </em>There, the majority stated that “the greater power to completely ban casino gambling necessarily includes the lesser power to ban advertising of casino gambling.” <span class="citation" data-id="111744"><a href="/opinion/111744/posadas-de-puerto-rico-associates-v-tourism-co-of-puerto-rico/#345" aria-description="Citation for case: Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of...">478 U. S., at 345-346</a></span>. It went on to state that <em>“because </em>the government could have enacted a wholesale prohibition of [casino gambling] it is permissible for the government to take the less intrusive step of allowing the conduct, but reducing the demand through restrictions on advertising.” <span class="citation" data-id="111744"><a href="/opinion/111744/posadas-de-puerto-rico-associates-v-tourism-co-of-puerto-rico/#346" aria-description="Citation for case: Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of..."><em>Id., </em>at 346</a></span>. The majority concluded that it would “surely be a strange constitutional doctrine which would concede to the legislature the authority to totally ban a product or activity, but deny to the legislature the authority to forbid the stimulation of demand for the product or activity through advertising on behalf of those who would profit from such increased demand.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="111744"><a href="/opinion/111744/posadas-de-puerto-rico-associates-v-tourism-co-of-puerto-rico/" aria-description="Citation for case: Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of...">Ibid.</a></span> </em>On the basis of <page-number citation-index="1" label="511">*511</page-number>these statements, the State reasons that its undisputed authority to ban alcoholic beverages must include the power to restrict advertisements offering them for sale.</p>
<p id="b609-5">In <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Coors Brewing Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="117924"><a href="/opinion/117924/rubin-v-coors-brewing-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.">514 U. S. 476</a></span> (1995), the United States advanced a similar argument as a basis for supporting a statutory prohibition against revealing the alcoholic content of malt beverages on product labels. We rejected the argument, noting that the statement in the <em>Posa-das </em>opinion was made only after the majority had concluded that the Puerto Rican regulation “survived the <em>Central Hudson </em>test.” <span class="citation" data-id="117924"><a href="/opinion/117924/rubin-v-coors-brewing-co/#483" aria-description="Citation for case: Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.">514 U. S., at 483, n. 2</a></span>. Further consideration persuades us that the “greater-includes-the-lesser” argument should be rejected for the additional and more important reason that it is inconsistent with both logic and well-settled doctrine.</p>
<p id="b609-6">Although we do not dispute the proposition that greater powers include lesser ones, we fail to see how that syllogism requires the conclusion that the State’s power to regulate commercial <em>activity </em>is “greater” than its power to ban truthful, nonmisleading commercial <em>speech. </em>Contrary to the assumption made in <em>Posadas, </em>we think it quite clear that banning speech may sometimes prove far more intrusive than banning conduct. As a venerable proverb teaches, it may prove more injurious to prevent people from teaching others how to fish than to prevent fish from being sold.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Similarly, a local ordinance banning bicycle lessons may curtail freedom far more than one that prohibits bicycle riding within city limits. In short, we reject the assumption that words are necessarily less vital to freedom than actions, or that logic somehow proves that the power to prohibit an activity is necessarily “greater” than the power to suppress speech about it.</p>
<p id="b610-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="512">*512</page-number>As a matter of First Amendment doctrine, the <em>Posadas </em>syllogism is even less defensible. The text of the First Amendment makes clear that the Constitution presumes that attempts to regulate speech are more dangerous than attempts to regulate conduct. That presumption accords with the essential role that the free flow of information plays in a democratic society. As a result, the First Amendment directs that government may not suppress speech as easily as it may suppress conduct, and that speech restrictions cannot be treated as simply another means that the government may use to achieve its ends.</p>
<p id="b610-4">These basic First Amendment principles clearly apply to commercial speech; indeed, the <em>Posadas </em>majority impliedly conceded as much by applying the <em>Central Hudson </em>test. Thus, it is no answer that commercial speech concerns products and services that the government may freely regulate. Our decisions from <em><span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens...">Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy</a></span> </em>on have made plain that a State’s regulation of the sale of goods differs in kind from a State’s regulation of accurate information about those goods. The distinction that our cases have consistently drawn between these two types of governmental action is fundamentally incompatible with the absolutist view that the State may ban commercial speech simply because it may constitutionally prohibit the underlying conduct.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b611-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="513">*513</page-number>That the State has chosen to license its liquor retailers does not change the analysis. Even though government is under no obligation to provide a person, or the public, a particular benefit, it does not follow that conferral of the benefit may be conditioned on the surrender of a constitutional right. See, <em>e. g., Frost &amp; Frost Trucking Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad Comm’n of Cal., </em><span class="citation" data-id="100914"><a href="/opinion/100914/frost-frost-trucking-co-v-railroad-commn-of-cal/#594" aria-description="Citation for case: Frost &amp; Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Comm&#x27;n of Cal.">271 U. S. 583, 594</a></span> (1926). In <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Sindermann, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108609"><a href="/opinion/108609/perry-v-sindermann/" aria-description="Citation for case: Perry v. Sindermann">408 U. S. 593</a></span> (1972), relying on a host of eases applying that principle during the preceding quarter century, the Court explained that government “may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests — especially his interest in freedom of speech.” <span class="citation" data-id="108609"><a href="/opinion/108609/perry-v-sindermann/#597" aria-description="Citation for case: Perry v. Sindermann"><em>Id., </em>at 597</a></span>. That teaching clearly applies to state attempts to regulate commercial speech, as our cases striking down bans on truthful, nonmisleading speech by licensed professionals attest. See, <em>e. g., Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Ariz., </em>433 U. S., at 355; <em>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="109450"><a href="/opinion/109450/virginia-state-board-of-pharmacy-v-virginia-citizens-consumer-council/" aria-description="Citation for case: Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens...">425 U. S. 748</a></span> (1976).</p>
<p id="b611-5">Thus, just as it is perfectly clear that Rhode Island could not ban all obscene liquor ads except those that advocated temperance, we think it equally clear that its power to ban the sale of liquor entirely does not include a power to censor all advertisements that contain accurate and nonmis-leading information about the price of the product. As the entire Court apparently now agrees, the statements in the <em>Posadas </em>opinion on which Rhode Island relies are no longer persuasive.</p>
<p id="b611-6">Finally, we find unpersuasive the State’s contention that, under <em>Posadas </em>and <em>Edge, </em>the price advertising ban should be upheld because it targets commercial speech that pertains to a “vice” activity. Respondents premise their request for a so-called “vice” exception to our commercial speech doctrine on language in <em>Edge </em>which characterized gambling as a “vice.” <em>Edge, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112899"><a href="/opinion/112899/united-states-v-edge-broadcasting-co/#426" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co.">509 U. S., at 426</a></span>; see also <em>Posadas, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111744"><a href="/opinion/111744/posadas-de-puerto-rico-associates-v-tourism-co-of-puerto-rico/#346" aria-description="Citation for case: Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of...">478 U. S., at 346-347</a></span>. Respondents misread our precedent. Our decision last Term striking down an alcohol-related advertising <page-number citation-index="1" label="514">*514</page-number>restriction effectively rejected the very contention respondents now make. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="117924"><a href="/opinion/117924/rubin-v-coors-brewing-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.">Rubin</a></span> </em>v. <em>Coors Brewing Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="117924"><a href="/opinion/117924/rubin-v-coors-brewing-co/#478" aria-description="Citation for case: Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.">514 U. S., at 478, 482, n. 2</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b612-4">Moreover, the scope of any “vice” exception to the protection afforded by the First Amendment would be difficult, if not impossible, to define. Almost any product that poses some threat to public health or public morals might reasonably be characterized by a state legislature as relating to “vice activity.” Such characterization, however, is anomalous when applied to products such as alcoholic beverages, lottery tickets, or playing cards, that may be lawfully purchased on the open market. The recognition of such an exception would also have the unfortunate consequence of either allowing state legislatures to justify censorship by the simple expedient of placing the “vice” label on selected lawful activities, or requiring the federal courts to establish a federal common law of vice. See Kurland, 1986 S. Ct. Rev., at 15. For these reasons, a “vice” label that is unaccompanied by a corresponding prohibition against the commercial behavior at issue fails to provide a principled justification for the regulation of commercial speech about that activity.</p>
<p id="b612-5">VII</p>
<p id="b612-6">From .1919 until 1933, the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution totally prohibited “the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors” in the United States and its territories. Section 1 of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed that prohibition, and § 2 delegated to the several States the power to prohibit commerce in, or the use of, alcoholic beverages.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The States’ regulatory power over this segment of commerce is therefore largely “unfettered <page-number citation-index="1" label="515">*515</page-number>by the Commerce Clause.” <em>Ziffrin, Inc. </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103241"><a href="/opinion/103241/ziffrin-inc-v-reeves/#138" aria-description="Citation for case: Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves">308 U. S. 132, 138</a></span> (1939).</p>
<p id="b613-5">As is clear, the text of the Twenty-first Amendment supports the view that, while it grants the States authority over commerce that might otherwise be reserved to the Federal Government, it places no limit whatsoever on other constitutional provisions. Nevertheless, Rhode Island argues, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that in this case the Twenty-first Amendment tilts the First Amendment analysis in the State’s favor. See <span class="citation" data-id="195687"><a href="/opinion/195687/44-liquormart-inc-v-rhode-island/#7" aria-description="Citation for case: 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island">39 F. 3d, at 7-8</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b613-6">In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on our decision in <em>California </em>v. <em>LaRue, </em><span class="citation" data-id="9425053"><a href="/opinion/108636/california-v-larue/" aria-description="Citation for case: California v. LaRue">409 U. S. 109</a></span> (1972).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em><span class="citation" data-id="9425053"><a href="/opinion/108636/california-v-larue/" aria-description="Citation for case: California v. LaRue">LaRue</a></span>, </em>five Members of the Court relied on the Twenty-first Amendment to buttress the conclusion that the First Amendment did not invalidate California’s prohibition of certain grossly sexual exhibitions in premises licensed to serve alcoholic beverages. Specifically, the opinion stated that the Twenty-first Amendment required that the prohibition be given an added presumption in favor of its validity. See <span class="citation" data-id="9425053"><a href="/opinion/108636/california-v-larue/#118" aria-description="Citation for case: California v. LaRue"><em>id., </em>at 118-119</a></span>.

LaRue">LaRue</a></span> </em>would have led to precisely the same result if it had placed no reliance on the Twenty-first Amendment.</p>
<p id="b613-7">Entirely apart from the Twenty-first Amendment, the State has ample power to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages in inappropriate locations. Moreover, in subsequent cases, the Court has recognized that the States’ inherent police powers provide ample authority to restrict the kind of “bacchanalian revelries” described in the <em><span class="citation" data-id="9425053"><a href="/opinion/108636/california-v-larue/" aria-description="Citation for case: California v.

As we recently noted: <em>“LaRue </em>did not involve <page-number citation-index="1" label="516">*516</page-number>commercial speech about alcohol, but instead concerned the regulation of nude dancing in places where alcohol was served.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="117924"><a href="/opinion/117924/rubin-v-coors-brewing-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rubin v.

<p id="b614-5">Without questioning the holding in <em><span class="citation" data-id="9425053"><a href="/opinion/108636/california-v-larue/" aria-description="Citation for case: California v.

As we explained in a case decided more than a decade after <em><span class="citation" data-id="9425053"><a href="/opinion/108636/california-v-larue/" aria-description="Citation for case: California v. LaRue">LaRue</a></span>, </em>although the Twenty-first Amendment limits the effect of the dormant Commerce Clause on a State’s regulatory power over the delivery or use of intoxicating beverages within its borders, “the Amendment does not license the States to ignore their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution.” <em>Capital Cities Cable, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crisp, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111215"><a href="/opinion/111215/capital-cities-cable-inc-v-crisp/#712" aria-description="Citation for case: Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v.

That general conclusion reflects our specific holdings that the Twenty-first Amendment does not in any way diminish the force of the Supremacy Clause, <em>ibid.; California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. </em>v. <em>Midcal Aluminum, Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="110215"><a href="/opinion/110215/california-retail-liquor-dealers-assn-v-midcal-aluminum-inc/#112" aria-description="Citation for case: California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v.

Boren">429 U. S. 190, 209</a></span> (1976). We see no reason why the First Amendment should not also be included in that list. Accordingly, we now hold that the Twenty-first Amendment does not qualify the constitutional prohibition against laws abridging the freedom of speech embodied in the First Amendment. The Twenty-first Amendment, therefore, cannot save Rhode Island’s ban on liquor price advertising.</p>
<p id="b614-6">VIII</p>
<p id="b614-7">Because Rhode Island has failed to carry its heavy burden of justifying its complete ban on price advertising, we conclude that R. I. Gen. Laws §§3-8-7 and 3-8-8.1 (1987), as well as Regulation 32 of the Rhode Island Liquor Control Administration, abridge speech in violation of the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
