**Lead Opinion**
 The seeds of the exception were planted by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit only seven years after Bramblett was decided.  In Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d 234 (1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), the defendant, who had falsely held himself out to be a bona fide member of the bar, was prosecuted on three counts of violating § 1001 for concealing from the court his name, identity, *709 and nonadmission to the bar.  After first acknowledging that, but for Bramblett , it might well have accepted the argument that Congress did not intend § 1001 to apply to the courts, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction.  But the court was clearly troubled by the potential sweep of § 1001.  Noting that the statute prohibits “concealment” and “covering up” of material facts, as well as intentional falsehoods, the court wondered whether the statute might be interpreted to criminalize conduct that falls well within the bounds of responsible advocacy.  9 The court concluded its opinion with this significant comment: “We are certain that neither Congress nor the Supreme Court intended the statute to include traditional trial tactics within the statutory terms ‘conceals or covers up.’ We hold only, on the authority of the Supreme Court construction, that the statute does apply to the type of action with which appellant was charged, action which essentially involved the ‘administrative’ or ‘housekeeping’ functions, not the ‘judicial’ machinery of the court.” 309 F. 2d, at 237 .  Relying on Morgan , the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a conviction several years later “because § 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents as evidence in a criminal proceeding.” United States v. Erhardt, <citedDecision>381 F. 2d 173, 175</citedDecision> (1967) (per curiam).  The court explained that the judicial function exception suggested in Morgan was necessary to prevent the perjury statute, with its two-witness rule (since repealed), from being undermined.  <citedDecision>381 F. 2d, at 175</citedDecision> .  *710 Once planted, the judicial function exception began to flower in a number of other Circuits.  The Ninth Circuit summarized the state of the law in 1985: “[T]he adjudicative functions exception to section 1001 has been suggested or recognized by appellate decisions since 1962, not long after the Supreme Court decided that section 1001 applies to matters within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch.  In these twenty-three years, there has been no response on the part of Congress either repudiating the limitation or refining it.  It therefore seems too late in the day to hold that no exception exists.” United States v. Mayer, 775 F. 2d 1387, 1390 (per curiam) (footnote omitted).  The Second Circuit sounded a similar theme in 1991, relying in part on the congressional acquiescence to which the Ninth Circuit had adverted in Mayer .  The Second Circuit wrote: “No court, to our knowledge, whether due to its acceptance of the exception or to prosecutorial reticence, has ever sustained a section 1001 conviction for false statements made by a defendant to a court acting in its judicial capacity.
**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
*716 Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I concur in the judgment of the Court, and join Parts I — III and VI of Justíce Stevens’ opinion. United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503 (1955), should be overruled. The doctrine of stare decisis protects the legitimate expectations of those who live under the law, and, as Alexander Hamilton observed, is one of the means by which exercise of “an arbitrary discretion in the courts” is restrained, The Federalist No. 78, p. 471 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Who ignores it must give reasons, and reasons that go beyond mere demonstration that the overruled opinion was wrong (otherwise the doctrine would be no doctrine at all). The reason here, as far as I am concerned, is the demonstration, over time, that Bramblett has unacceptable consequences, which can be judicially avoided (absent overruling) only by limiting Bramblett in a manner that is irrational or by importing exceptions with no basis in law. Unlike Justice Stevens, I do not regard the Courts of Appeals’ attempts to limit Bramblett as an “'intervening development of the law,’” ante, at 713 (quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989)), that puts us to a choice between two conflicting lines of authority. Such “intervening developments” by lower courts that we do not agree with are ordinarily disposed of by reversal. See, e. g., McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350 (1987). Instead, the significance I find in the fact that so many Courts of Appeals have strained so mightily to discern an exception that the statute does not contain, see ante, at 699, n. 2 (collecting cases), is that it demonstrates how great a potential for mischief federal judges have discovered in the mistaken reading of 18 U. S. C. § 1001 , a potential we did not fully appreciate when Bramblett was decided. To be sure, since 18 U. S. C. §1001’s prohibition of concealment is violated only when *717 there exists a duty to disclose, see, e.g., United States v. Kingston, 971 F. 2d 481, 489 (CA10 1992); United States v. Richeson, 825 F. 2d 17, 20 (CA4 1987); United States v. Irwin, 654 F. 2d 671, 678-679 (CA10 1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 1016 (1982), it does not actually prohibit any legitimate trial tactic. There remains, however, a serious concern that the threat of criminal prosecution under the capacious provisions of § 1001 will deter vigorous representation of opposing interests in adversarial litigation, particularly representation of criminal defendants, whose adversaries control the machinery of § 1001 prosecution. One could avoid the problem by accepting the Courts of Appeals’ invention of a “judicial function” exception, but there is simply no basis in the text of the statute for that. Similarly unprincipled would be rejecting Bramblett’s dictum that §1001 applies to the courts, while adhering to Bramblett’s holding that §1001 applies to Congress. This would construct a bizarre regime in which “department” means the Executive and Legislative Branches, but not the Judicial, thereby contradicting not only the statute’s intent (as Bramblett does), but, in addition, all conceivable interpretations of the English language. Neither of these solutions furthers the goal of avoiding “an arbitrary discretion in the courts”; they seem to me much more arbitrary than simply overruling a wrongly decided case. The other goal of stare decisis, preserving justifiable expectations, is not much at risk here. Those whose reliance on Bramblett induced them to tell the truth to Congress or the courts, instead of lying, have no claim on our solicitude. Some convictions obtained under Bramblett may have to be overturned, and in a few instances wrongdoers may go free who could have been prosecuted and convicted under a different statute if Bramblett had not been assumed to be the law. I count that a small price to pay for the uprooting of this weed.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 * To the extent it has secured valid convictions in some courts in reliance on Bramblett , the Government should not now be forced to endure requests for habeas relief that will inevitably be filed in the wake of the Court’s opinion.  The additional comments set forth in the concurring opinion equally disregard the respect due a unanimous decision rendered by six Justices who took the same oath of office sworn by the six Justices who overrule Bramblett today.  The doctrine of stare decisis presumes to reinforce the notion that justice is dispensed according to law and not to serve *724 “the proclivities of individuals.” Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986).  The opinion of one Justice that another’s view of a statute was wrong, even really wrong, does not overcome the institutional advantages conferred by adherence to stare decisis in cases where the wrong is fully redressable by a coordinate branch of government.  This, then, is clearly a case where it is better that the matter be decided than that it be decided right.  Bramblett governs this case, and if the rule of that case is to be overturned it should be at the hands of Congress, and not of this Court. > For false statements made to Bankruptcy Courts, see United States v.

**Combined Opinion**
 The overlaps here simply demonstrate that prosecutors cannot be said to have any significant reliance interest in Bramblett .  [15]  The absence of significant reliance interests is confirmed by an examinationof statisticaldata regarding actualcases brought under§ 1001.  The Government has secured convictions under § 1001 in 2,247 cases over the last five fiscal years, see post, at 722, but the dissent can identify only five reported § 1001 cases in that time period brought in connection with falsestatements made tothe Judiciaryand Legislature.  Post, at 723, n. (At leasttwo ofthe five were unsuccessful, fromthe Government's pointof view.) This tinyhandfulof prosecutionsdoes not,inour view, evidence a weighty reliance interest on the part of prosecutors in adhering to the interpretation of § 1001 set forth in Bramblett .
