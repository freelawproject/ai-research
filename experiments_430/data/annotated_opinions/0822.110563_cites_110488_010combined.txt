 As the Montana Supreme Court noted, "there can be no argument here that a substantial, in fact, the only nexus of the severance of coal is established in Montana." 혰 Mont., at 혰, 615 P. 2d, at 855 .  Nor is there any question here regarding apportionment or potential multiple taxation, for as the state court observed, "the severance can occur in no other state" and "no other state can tax the severance." Ibid. Appellants do contend, however, that the Montana tax is invalid under the third and fourth prongs of the Complete Auto Transit test.  Appellants assert that the Montana tax "discriminate[s] against interstate commerce" because 90% of Montana coal is shipped to other States under contracts that shift the tax burden primarily to non-Montana utility companies and thus *618 to citizens of other States.  But the Montana tax is computed at the same rate regardless of the final destination of the coal, and there is no suggestion here that the tax is administered in a manner that departs from this evenhanded formula.  We are not, therefore, confronted here with the type of differential tax treatment of interstate and intrastate commerce that the Court has found in other "discrimination" cases. See, e. g., Maryland v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>451 U. S. 725</citedDecision> (1981); Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S. 318 (1977); cf. Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27 (1980); Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978).  Instead, the gravamen of appellants' claim is that a state tax must be considered discriminatory for purposes of the Commerce Clause if the tax burden is borne primarily by out-of-state consumers.  Appellants do not suggest that this assertion is based on any of this Court's prior discriminatory tax cases. In fact, a similar claim was considered and rejected in Heisler .  There, it was argued that Pennsylvania had a virtual monopoly of anthracite coal and that, because 80% of the coal was shipped out of State, the tax discriminated against and impermissibly burdened interstate commerce.  260 U. S., at 251-253 .  The Court, however, dismissed these factors as "adventitious considerations." Id., at 259 .

Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U. S. 100, 108 (1975), quoting Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S., at 254 .  The "just share of state tax burden" includes sharing in the cost of providing "police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and `the advantages of a civilized society.'" Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980), quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 445 (1979).  See Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S., at 750-751 ; id., at 764 (POWELL, J., concurring in part and concurring in result); General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436, 440-441 (1964).  Furthermore, there can be no question that Montana may constitutionally raise general revenue by imposing a severance tax on coal mined in the State.  The entire value of the coal, before transportation, originates in the State, and mining of the coal depletes the resource base and wealth of the State, thereby diminishing a future source of taxes and economic activity.  [13] Cf. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>451 U. S., at 758-759</citedDecision> .  In many respects, a severance tax is like a real property tax, which has never been doubted as a legitimate means of raising revenue by the situs State (quite apart from the right of that or any other State to tax income derived from use of the property).  See, e. g., Old Dominion S.S. Co. v. Virginia, 198 U. S. 299 (1905); Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Missouri ex rel. Gottlieb, 190 U. S. 412 (1903); Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, 155 U. S. 688 (1895).  When, as here, a general revenue tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce and is apportioned to activities occurring within *625 the State, the State "is free to pursue its own fiscal policies, unembarrassed by the Constitution, if by the practical operation of a tax the state has exerted its power in relation to opportunities which it has given, to protection which it has afforded, to benefits which it has conferred by the fact of being an orderly, civilized society." Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435, 444 (1940).  As we explained in General Motors Corp. v. Washington, supra, at 440-441: "[T]he validity of the tax rests upon whether the State is exacting a constitutionally fair demand for that aspect of interstate commerce to which it bears a special relation.  For our purposes, the decisive issue turns on the operating incidence of the tax. In other words, the question is whether the State has exerted its power in proper proportion to appellant's activities within the State and to appellant's consequent enjoyment of the opportunities and protections which the State has afforded.

 II This Court's Commerce Clause cases have been marked by tension between two competing concepts: the view that interstate commerce should enjoy a "free trade" immunity from state taxation, see, e. g., Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249, 252 (1946), and the view that interstate commerce may be required to "`pay its way,'" see, e. g., Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938).  See generally Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., at 278-281, 288-289, n. 15 ; Simet & Lynn, Interstate Commerce Must Pay Its Way: The Demise of Spector, 31 Nat. Tax J. 53 (1978); Hellerstein, Foreword, State Taxation Under the Commerce Clause: An Historical Perspective, 29 Vand. L. Rev. 335 , 335-339 (1976).  In Complete Auto Transit, the Court resolved that tension by unanimously reaffirming that interstate commerce is not immune from state taxation.  430 U. S., at 288.  But at the same time the Court made clear that not all state taxation of interstate commerce is valid; a state tax will be sustained against Commerce Clause challenge only if "the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State." Id., at 279.  See Maryland v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>451 U. S. 725, 754</citedDecision> (1981).  The Court today acknowledges and, indeed, holds that a Commerce Clause challenge to a state severance tax must be evaluated under Complete Auto Transit's four-part test.  Ante, at 617.  I fully agree.  I cannot agree, however, with the Court's application of that test to the facts of the present case. Appellants concede, and the Court properly concludes, *645 that the first two prongs of the test혰substantial nexus and fair apportionment혰are satisfied here.  The Court also correctly observes that Montana's severance tax is facially neutral.  It does not automatically follow, however, that the Montana severance tax does not unduly burden or interfere with interstate commerce.
**Combined Opinion**
 No trial will ever be necessary on the issue of fair relationship so long as a State is careful to impose a proportional rather than a flat tax rate; thus, the Court's rule is no less "mechanical" than the approach entertained in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245 (1922), disapproved today, ante, at 617.  [10] Under the Court's reasoning, any ad valorem tax will satisfy the fourth prong; indeed, the Court implicitly ratifies Montana's contention that it is free to tax this coal at 100% or even 1,000% of value, should it *646 choose to do so. Tr. of Oral Arg. 21.  Likewise, the Court's analysis indicates that Montana's severance tax would not run afoul of the Commerce Clause even if it raised sufficient revenue to allow Montana to eliminate all other taxes upon its citizens.  [11] The Court's prior cases neither require nor support such a startling result.  [12] The Court often has noted that "`[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business.'" Complete Auto Transit, 430 U. S., at 279 (emphasis added), quoting Western Live Stock, 303 U. S., at 254 .  See <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>451 U. S., at 754</citedDecision> .  Accordingly, *647 interstate commerce cannot claim any exemption from a state tax that "is fairly related to the services provided by the State." Complete Auto Transit, 430 U. S., at 279 .  We have not interpreted this requirement of "fair relation" in a narrow sense; interstate commerce may be required to share equally with intrastate commerce the cost of providing "police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and `the advantages of a civilized society.'" Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980), quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 445 (1979).  See, e. g., Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S. 416, 433 (1946).  Moreover, interstate commerce can be required to "pay its own way" in a narrower sense as well: the State may tax interstate commerce for the purpose of recovering those costs attributable to the activity itself.
**Combined Opinion**
 In framing its taxing measures to reach interstate commerce, the State must be "at pains to do so in a manner which avoids the evils forbidden by the commerce clause and puts that commerce actually on a plane of equality with local trade in local taxation." Nippert, 327 U. S., at 434 (emphasis added).  Thus, the Court has been particularly vigilant to review taxes that "single out interstate business," since "[a]ny tailored tax of this sort creates an increased danger of error in apportionment, of discrimination against interstate commerce, and of a lack of relationship to the services provided by the State." Complete Auto Transit, 430 U. S., at 288-289, n. 15 .  [14] Moreover, the Court's vigilance has not been limited to taxes that discriminate upon their face: "Not the tax in a vacuum of words, but its practical consequences for the doing of interstate commerce in applications to concrete facts are our concern." Nippert, 327 U. S., at 431 .  See <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>451 U. S., at 756</citedDecision> .  This is particularly true when the challenged tax, while facially neutral, falls so heavily upon interstate commerce that its burden "is not likely to be alleviated by those political restraints which are normally exerted on legislation where it affects adversely interests within the state." McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., 309 U. S. 33 , 46, n. 2 (1940).  Cf. Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U. S. 429, 446-447 (1978).  In sum, then, when a tax has been "tailored" to reach interstate commerce, *650 the Court's cases suggest that we require a closer "fit" under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test than when interstate commerce has not been singled out by the challenged tax. As a number of commentators have noted, state severance taxes upon minerals are particularly susceptible to "tailoring." "Like a tollgate lying athwart a trade route, a severance or processing tax conditions access to natural resources." Developments in the Law: Federal Limitations on State Taxation of Interstate Business, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 953 , 970 (1962).

 It is clear, however, that that likelihood increases to the extent that the taxing States form a cartel arrangement.  Gillis, at 308.  See n. 5, supra. Whether the tax is in fact exported here is, of course, an issue for trial. [17]  There is no basis for the conclusion that the issues presented would be more difficult than those routinely dealt with in complex civil litigation.  See, e. g., Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 349 (1981) (dissenting opinion).  "The complexity of a properly presented federal question is hardly a suitable basis for denying federal courts the power to adjudicate." Id., at 349, n. 25 .  [18]  See n. 13, supra. Cf. Maryland v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>451 U. S. 725, 755, n. 27</citedDecision> (1981) (reciting argument of United States that use of 75% of proceeds of Louisiana's "First-Use Tax" to service general debt, and only 25% to alleviate alleged environmental damage from pipeline activities, suggests that tax was not fairly apportioned to value of activities occurring within the State).  [19]  As the Court notes, the issue has not escaped congressional attention.  Ante, at 628, n. 18.  No bill, however, has yet been passed, and this Court is not disabled to act in the interim; to the contrary, strong policy and institutional considerations suggest that it is appropriate that the Court consider this issue.  See Brown, at 222.  Indeed, whereas Montana argues that the question presented here is one better left to Congress, in 1980 hearings before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the then Governor of Montana took the position that the reasonableness of this tax was "a question most properly left to the court," not a congressional committee.  See Hearing on S. 2695 before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 237 (1980).
