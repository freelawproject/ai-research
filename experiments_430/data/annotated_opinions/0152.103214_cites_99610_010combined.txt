**Combined Opinion**
 The assessment of the present tax was technically under the Act of 1936, but that Act merely carried forward the provisions of the Act of 1932, for the inclusion of compensation of "judges of courts of the United States, taking office after June 6, 1932" which had been similarly incorporated in the Revenue Act of 1934 ( 48 Stat. 680 , 686-687).  Therefore, the power of Congress to include Judge Woodrough's salary as a circuit judge in his "gross income" must be judged on the basis of the validity of § 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932, and not as though that power had been originally asserted by the Revenue Act of 1936.  For it was the Act of June 6, 1932 that gave notice to all judges thereafter to be appointed, of the new Congressional policy to include the judicial salaries of such judges in the assessment of income taxes.  The fact that Judge Woodrough before he became a circuit judge and prior to June 6, 1932, had been a district judge *280 is wholly irrelevant to the matter in issue.  The two offices have different statutory origins, are filled by separate nominations and confirmations, and enjoy different emoluments.  A new appointee to a circuit court of appeals occupies a new office no less when he is taken from the district bench than when he is drawn from the bar.  By means of § 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932, Congress sought to avoid, at least in part, the consequences of Evans v. Gore, <citedDecision>253 U.S. 245</citedDecision> .  That case, decided on June 1, 1920, ruled for the first time that a provision requiring the compensation received by the judges of the United States to be included in the "gross income" from which the net income is to be computed, although merely part of a taxing measure of general, non-discriminatory application to all earners of incomes, is contrary to Article III, § 1, of the Constitution which provides that the "Compensation" of the "Judges" "shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office." See also the separate opinion of Mr. Justice Field in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429, 586 , 604 et seq. To be sure, in a letter to Secretary Chase, Chief Justice Taney expressed similar views.  [1] In doing so, he merely gave his extra-judicial opinion, asserting at the same time that the question could not be adjudicated.  [2] Chief Justice Taney's vigorous views were shared by Attorney General Hoar.  [3] Thereafter, both the Treasury Department [4] and Congress [5] *281 acted upon this construction of the Constitution.  However, the meaning which <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Gore</citedDecision> imputed to the history which explains Article III, § 1, was contrary to the way in which it was read by other English-speaking courts.  [6] The decision met wide and steadily growing disfavor from legal scholarship and professional opinion.  [7] Evans v. <citedDecision>Gore</citedDecision> itself was rejected by most of the courts before whom the matter came after that decision.  [8] Having regard to these circumstances, the question immediately before us is whether Congress exceeded its constitutional power in providing that United States judges *282 appointed after the Revenue Act of 1932 shall not enjoy immunity from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes of income is subjected.  Thereby, of course, Congress has committed itself to the position that a non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not, when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution of his salary within the prohibition of Article III, § 1, of the Constitution.  To suggest that it makes inroads upon the independence of judges who took office after Congress had thus charged them with the common duties of citizenship, by making them bear their aliquot share of the cost of maintaining the Government, is to trivialize the great historic experience on which the framers based the safeguards of Article III, § 1.  [9] To subject them to a general tax is merely to recognize that judges are also citizens, and that their particular function in government does not generate an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government whose Constitution and laws they are charged with administering.  After this case came here, Congress, by § 3 of the Public Salary Tax Act of 1939, amended § 22 (a) so as to make it applicable to "judges of courts of the United States who took office on or before June 6, 1932." [10] That section, however, is not now before us.

 .  [and] the judges of the Supreme and inferior courts .  .  .  the compensation received as such." [13] The reports of the congressional committees having the measure in charge indicate that the Congress was in doubt as to the constitutional validity of that provision and intended to have the question decided by the courts.  [14] The question was raised and presented for decision in Evans v. Gore, <citedDecision>253 U.S. 245</citedDecision> .  The Collector included the salary for 1918 of Judge Evans, appointed before enactment of the taxing statute, in gross income.  Had it been excluded, he would have had no taxable income.  He paid the tax and brought suit to recover the amount so exacted.  The United States district court for the western district of Kentucky held him not entitled to recover.  But, after argument by eminent counsel including the Solicitor General, this Court held that the clause declaring that compensation of judges "shall not be diminished during their continuance in office" prevents diminution by taxation and that it has been so construed in the actual practice of the government.  For the purpose of disclosing the reasons for and true meaning of the clause forbidding diminution of compensation of judges, the opinion of the Court, written by Mr. Justice Van Devanter, brought forward statements of Alexander Hamilton, Chief Justice Marshall, Justice Story, Chancellor Kent, Chief Justice Taney, Justice Field, Attorneys General Hoar and Olney and others.

 .  what is comprehended in the congressional power to tax,  where its exertion is not directly or impliedly interdicted,  it becomes additionally manifest that the prohibition now under discussion was intended to embrace and prevent diminution through the exertion of that power; for, as this court repeatedly has held, the power to tax carries with it `the power to embarrass and destroy'; may be applied to every object within its range `in such measure as Congress may determine'; enables that body `to select one calling and omit another, to tax one class of property and to forebear to tax another'; and may be applied in different ways to different objects so long as there is `geographical uniformity' in the duties, imposts and excises imposed.[Citing.] Is it not therefore morally certain that the discerning *294 statesmen who framed the Constitution and were so sedulously bent on securing the independence of the judiciary intended to protect the compensation of the judges from assault and diminution in the name or form of a tax?  Could not the purpose of the prohibition be wholly thwarted if this avenue of attack were left open?  Certainly there is nothing in the words of the prohibition indicating that it is directed against one legislative power and not another; and in our opinion due regard for its spirit and principle requires that it be taken as directed against them all." Mr. Justice Holmes wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brandeis joined.  With that expression his opposition to the decision ended.  Two years later, in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U.S. 501 , writing for the Court, invalidating a state tax upon net income of a lessee from sales of his share of oil and gas received under leases of restricted Indian land, he said (p. 505): "In cases where the principal is absolutely immune from interference an inquiry is allowed into the sources from which net income is derived and if a part of it comes from such a source the tax is pro tanto void; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429 ; 158 U.S. 601 ; a rule lately illustrated by <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Gore</citedDecision> .  .  ." And in that case he relied on the truth, as put by Chief Justice Marshall in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431 , that "the power to tax involves the power to destroy." He quoted (p. 505) with approval from Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U.S. 522 , the statement of the opinion (p. 530) that "A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to destroy the power to make them." [15] *295 Miles v. Graham (1925), 268 U.S. 501 , held invalid § 213 (a), Revenue Act of 1918, (condemned in <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Gore</citedDecision> ) when applied to compensation of Judge Graham, *296 appointed after its enactment.  Mr. Justice Holmes joined in the decision.  Mr. Justice Brandeis merely noted dissent.  In the course of the opinion, we said: "Does the circumstance that defendant in error's appointment came after the taxing Act require a different view concerning his right to exemption?  The answer depends upon the import of the word `compensation' in the constitutional provision.  "The words and history of the clause indicate that the purpose was to impose upon Congress the duty definitely to declare what sum shall be received by each judge out of the public funds and the times for payment.  When this duty has been complied with the amount specified becomes the compensation which is protected against diminution during his continuance in office.  ".  .  .  The compensation fixed by law when defendant in error assumed his official duties was $7,500 per annum, and to exact a tax in respect of this would diminish it within the plain rule of <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Gore</citedDecision> .  "The taxing Act became a law [February 24, 1919] prior to the statute prescribing salaries for judges of the Court of Claims [approved February 25, 1919], but if the dates were reversed it would be impossible to construe the former as an amendment which reduced salaries by the amount of the tax imposed.  No judge is required to pay a definite percentage of his salary, but all are commanded to return, as a part of `gross income,' `the compensation received as such' from the United States.  From the `gross income' various deductions and credits are allowed, as for interest paid, contributions or gifts made, personal exemptions varying with family relations, etc., and upon the net result assessment is made.  The plain purpose was to require all judges to return their compensation as an item of `gross income,' and to tax this as other salaries.  This is forbidden by the Constitution.  *297 "The power of Congress definitely to fix the compensation to be received at stated intervals by judges thereafter appointed is clear.  It is equally clear, we think, that there is no power to tax a judge of a court of the United States on account of the salary prescribed for him by law." In O'Donoghue v. United States (1933), 289 U.S. 516 , we construed the Act of June 30, 1932 [16] reducing the salaries of all judges "except judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office." We there held that the supreme court and court of appeals of the District of Columbia were constitutional courts and therefore that the judges of those courts were excepted from the salary reduction.  We cited the authorities, adopted the reasoning, and reaffirmed the conclusions on which rest the Court's judgments in <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Gore</citedDecision> and Miles v. Graham .  And see Booth v. United States, 291 U.S. 339 .  Evidently the Court intends to destroy the decision in <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Gore</citedDecision> .  Without suggesting that there is any distinction between that case and Miles v. Graham , it declares that the latter "cannot survive." But the decision of today fails to deal with, much less to detract from the reasoning of those cases. The opinion would imply that the letter of Chief Justice Taney to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the separate opinion of Mr. Justice Field in the Pollock case were treated as having weight as judicial decisions.  But nowhere has that ever been suggested.  However, all who are familiar with our judicial history know that entitled to great respect are the reasoned conclusions of these eminent American jurists as to the true intent and meaning of the Constitution of the United States.  And similarly worthy of attention are the opinions of the Attorneys General and other public officials following the reasoning of Chief Justice Taney. *298 Now the Court cites, as if entitled to prevail against those well-sustained opinions and the deliberate judgments of this Court, opposing views  if indeed upon examination they reasonably may be so deemed  of English speaking judges in foreign countries.  It refers, footnote 6, to the decision of the Privy Council in Judges v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan (1937), 2 D.L.R. 209, construing income tax statutes of Saskatchewan.
