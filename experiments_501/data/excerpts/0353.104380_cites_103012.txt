 Thirdly, a North Carolina statute, upheld by the highest court of North Carolina, is of course expressive of North Carolina policy.  The essence of diversity jurisdiction is that a federal court enforces State law and State policy.  If North Carolina has authoritatively announced that deficiency judgments cannot be secured within its borders, it contradicts the presuppositions of diversity jurisdiction for a federal court in that State to give such a deficiency judgment.  North Carolina would hardly allow defeat of a State-wide policy through occasional suits in a federal *192 court. What is more important, diversity jurisdiction must follow State law and policy.  A federal court in North Carolina, when invoked on grounds of diversity of citizenship, cannot give that which North Carolina has withheld.  Availability of diversity jurisdiction which was put into the Constitution so as to prevent discrimination against outsiders is not to effect discrimination against the great body of local citizens.  Cases like Lupton’s Sons Co. v. Automobile Club, 225 U. S. 489, are obsolete insofar as they are based on a view of diversity jurisdiction which came to an end with Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, <citedDecision>304 U. S. 64</citedDecision> .  That decision drastically limited the power of federal district courts to entertain suits in diversity cases that could not be brought in the respective State courts or were barred by defenses controlling in the State courts.  Compare Suydam v. Broadnax, 14 Pet. 67, 75 .  Of course, where resort is had to a federal court not on grounds of diversity of citizenship but because a federal right is claimed, the limitations upon the courts of a State do not control a federal court sitting in the State.  Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392 .  8.  After an adverse decision against Bullington on a cause of action created by State law, Bullington wants to start all over again in another North Carolina court, albeit a federal court. The first litigation raised and adjudicated federal issues every one of which is again involved in the second suit.

 But, if so, why speak also of res judicata?  The law should not be made into such a merry-go-round.  Bullington is entitled to one full day in court on the substance of his claim.  This he has not had.  I hardly need add that I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Reed.  Mr. Justice Jackson joins in this opinion.  Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, <citedDecision>304 U. S. 64</citedDecision> .  The Court does not hold that the full faith and credit clause, Const., Art. IV, § 1, binds the federal courts to give the North Carolina judgment the effect of precluding a further suit in the federal *202 courts on the substantive cause of action.  Two difficulties would arise.  (1) If, as the Court asserts, the federal court in diversity cases were only “another North Carolina court,” the full faith and credit clause would have no application; but, that it may, see Cooper v. Newell, 173 U. S. 555 , 567: “.  .  .  the courts of the United States are tribunals of a different sovereignty, and exercise a distinct and independent jurisdiction from that exercised by the state courts, and this is true in respect of the courts of the several States as between each other.
