**Combined Opinion**
 It has sometimes left it to an administrative board or agency to determine whether the activities sought to be regulated or prohibited have such effect, as in the case of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the National Labor Relations Act, or whether they come within the statutory definition of the prohibited Act, as in the Federal Trade Commission Act.  And sometimes Congress itself has said that a particular activity affects the commerce, as it did in the present Act, the Safety Appliance Act and the Railway Labor Act.  In passing on the validity of legislation of the class last mentioned the only function of courts is to determine whether the particular activity regulated or prohibited is within the reach *121 of the federal power.  See United States v. Ferger, supra; Virginian Ry. Co. v. Federation, 300 U. S. 515, 553 .  Congress, having by the present Act adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards, it may choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involve control of intrastate activities.  Such legislation has often been sustained with respect to powers, other than the commerce power granted to the national government, when the means chosen, although not themselves within the granted power, were nevertheless deemed appropriate aids to the accomplishment of some purpose within an admitted power of the national government.  See Jacob Ruppert, Inc. v. Caffey, 251 U. S. 264 ; Everard’s Breweries v. Day, <citedDecision>265 U. S. 545, 560</citedDecision> ; Westfall v. United States, 274 U. S. 256, 259 .  As to state power under the Fourteenth Amendment, compare Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S. 606, 609 ; St. John v. New York, 201 U. S. 633 ; Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192, 201-202 .  A familiar like exercise of power is the regulation of intrastate transactions which are so commingled with or related to interstate commerce that all must be regulated if the interstate commerce is to be effectively controlled.  Shreveport Case, 234 U. S. 342 ; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563 ; United States v. New York Central R. Co., supra, 464; Currin v. Wallace, 306 U. S. 1 ; Mulford v. Smith, supra. Similarly Congress may require inspection and preventive treatment of all cattle in a disease infected area in order to prevent shipment in interstate commerce of some of the cattle without the treatment.  Thornton v. United States, 271 U. S. 414 .  It may prohibit the removal, at destination, of labels required by the Pure Pood & Drugs Act to be affixed to ar *122 tides transported in interstate commerce.  McDermott v. Wisconsin, 228 U. S. 115 .
**Combined Opinion**
 So far as Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238 , is inconsistent with this conclusion, its doctrine is limited in principle by the decisions under the Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act, which we have cited and which we follow.  See also Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U. S. 381 ; Currin v. Wallace, supra; Mulford v. Smith, supra; United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., supra; Clover Fork Coal Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 97 F. 2d 331 ; National Labor Relations Board v. Crowe Coal Co., 104 F. 2d 633 ; National Labor Relations Board v. Good Coal Co., 110 F. 2d 501 .  Our conclusion is unaffected by the Tenth Amendment which provides: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the *124 States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.  There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers.  See e. g., II Elliot’s Debates, 123, 131; III id. 450, 464, 600; IV id. 140, 149; I Annals of Congress, 432, 761, 767-768; Story, Commentaries on the Constitution, §§ 1907-1908.  From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end.  Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 324, 325 ; McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 405, 406; Gordon v. United States, 117 U. S. 697, 705 ; Lottery Case, supra; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, supra, 344-345; <citedDecision>Everard’s Breweries</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>

  558</citedDecision> ; United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 733 ; see United States v. The Brigantine William, 28 Fed. Cas. No. 16,700, p. 622.  Whatever doubts may have arisen of the soundness of that conclusion, they have been put at rest by the decisions under the Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act which we have cited.  See also, Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U. S. 288, 330-331 ; Wright v. Union Central Ins. Co., 304 U. S. 502, 516 .  Validity of the requirement of records of wages and hours.  § 15 (a) (5) and § 11 (c).  These requirements are incidental to those for the prescribed wages and *125 hours, and hence validity of the former turns on validity of the latter.  Since, as we have held, Congress may require production for interstate commerce to conform to those conditions, it may require the employer, as a means of enforcing the valid law, to keep a record showing whether he has in fact complied with it.
