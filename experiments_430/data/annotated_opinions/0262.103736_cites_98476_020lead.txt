 .  .” See.  9467.02 provides that “In all civil eases where the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the residence of.  one of the parties to the action, the court shall require corroboration of the evidence of such residence.” L. 1931, p. -277.  Thus we have here no question as to extraterritorial effect of a divorce decree insofar as it affects property in another State.  See the cases cited, infra, note 5.  Fall v. Eastin, 215 U. S. 1 ; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U. S. 386 ; Hood v. McGehee, <citedDecision>237 U. S. 611</citedDecision> .  These decisions refuse to require courts of one state to allow acts or judgments of another to control the disposition or devolution of realty in the former.  They seem to rest on tire doctrine that the state where the land is located is “sole mistress” of its rules of real property.  See <citedDecision>Hood</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>McGehee, supra, p. 615</citedDecision> ; and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in Fall v. Eastin, supra, p. 14 .  That the case of Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., 191 U. S. 373 , is not an exception but only an appropriate application of the doctrine of Jorum non conveniens, see Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642-643 .  It has been repeatedly stated that the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to enforce the penal laws of another.  See, for example, Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657, 666 ; Converse *295 v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243, 260 ; Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145 , 160.  But the question of whether a judgment based on a penalty is entitled to full faith and credit was reserved in Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U. S. 268, 279 .  For other dicta that the application of the full faith and credit clause may be limited by the policy of the law of the forum, see Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, supra, p. 160; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, 294 U. S. 532, 546 ; Broderick v. Rosner, supra, note 5, p. 642 .  Grover & Baker Machine Co. v. Radcliffe, 137 U. S. 287 ; National Exchange Bank v. Wiley, 195 U. S. 257 ; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 U. S. 394 ; Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 U. S. 25, 29 ; Flexner v. Parson, 248 U. S. 289 .
