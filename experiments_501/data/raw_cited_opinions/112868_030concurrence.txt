<p id="b330-7">In <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U. S. 279 (1991), we divided the class of constitutional violations that may occur during the course of a criminal proceeding, be it at trial or sentencing, into two categories: one consisting of “trial error[s],” which “may ... be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented,” <em>id., </em>at 307-308 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J., for the Court), and are amenable to harmless-error analysis; the other consisting of “structural defects,” which “affec[t] the framework within which the trial proceeds,” <em>id., </em>at 310, and require automatic reversal. There is a “strong presumption” that any error will fall into the first of these categories. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U. S. 570, 579 (1986). Thus, it is the rare ease in which a constitutional violation will not be subject to harmless-error analysis. See <em>Fulminante, supra, </em>at 309-310 (listing examples of structural errors).</p>
<p id="b330-8">The Court holds today that the reasonable-doubt instruction given at Sullivan’s trial, which (it is conceded) violates due process under our decision in <em>Cage </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>498 U. S. 39 (1990) <em>(per curiam), </em>amounts to structural error, and thus cannot be harmless regardless of how overwhelming the evidence of Sullivan’s guilt. See <em>ante, </em>at 281-282. It grounds this conclusion in its determination that harmless-error analysis cannot be conducted with respect to error of this sort consistent with the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. We of course have long since rejected the argument that, as a general matter, the Sixth Amendment prohibits the application of harmless-error analysis in determin<page-number citation-index="1" label="283">*283</page-number>ing whether constitutional error had a prejudicial impact on the outcome of a case. See, <em>e. g., Rose, supra, </em>at 582, n. 11. The Court concludes that the situation at hand is fundamentally different, though, because, in the case of a constitutionally deficient reasonable-doubt instruction, “the entire premise of <em>Chapman </em>[harmless-error] review is simply absent.” <em>Ante, </em>at 280.</p>
<p id="b331-5">Where the jury views the evidence from the lens of a defective reasonable-doubt instruction, the Court reasons, there can be <em>no </em>factual findings made by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in which an appellate court can ground its harmless-error analysis. See <em>ante, </em>at 280-281. The Court thus distinguishes our cases in which we have found jury instructions that create an unconstitutional presumption regarding an element of the offense subject to harmless-error review. In <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>for example, we held that harmless-error analysis may be applied in reviewing instructions that violate the principles of <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U. S. 510 (1979), and <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U. S. 307 (1985). The “malice instruction” in <em>Rose </em>shifted the burden of proof on the issue of intent, in violation of due process under our decision in <em>Sandstrom. </em>Because the jury was instructed to presume malice from certain predicate facts, <em>and it was required to find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>we held that the <em>Sandstrom </em>error was amenable to harmless-error analysis. 478 U. S., at 580. See also <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>460 U. S. 73, 96-97 (1983) (Powell, J., dissenting).</p>
<p id="b331-6">There are many similarities between the instructional error in <em>Rose </em>and the one in this case. In the first place, neither error restricted the defendants’ “opportunity to put on evidence and make argument to support [their] claim[s] of innocence.” 478 U. S., at 579. Moreover, “[u]nlike [structural] errors such as judicial bias or denial of counsel, the error[s] ... did not affect the composition of the record.” <em>Id., </em>at 579, n. 7. Finally, neither error removed an element of the offense from the jury’s consideration, <em>id., </em>at 580, n. 8, <page-number citation-index="1" label="284">*284</page-number>or prevented the jury from considering certain evidence. (In this regard, a trial in which a deficient reasonable-doubt instruction is given seems to me to be quite different from one in which no reasonable-doubt instruction is given at all.) Thus, in many respects, the <em>Cage </em>violation committed at Sullivan’s trial bears the hallmark of an error that is amenable to harmless-error analysis.</p>
<p id="b332-5">One may question whether, even in the case of <em>Sandstrom, </em>error, the ability to conduct harmless-error review is dependent on the existence of “beyond a reasonable doubt” jury findings. In the typical case, of course, a jury does not make explicit factual findings; rather, it simply renders a general verdict on the question of guilt or innocence. Thus, although it may be possible to conclude from the jury’s verdict that it has found a predicate fact (or facts), the reviewing court is usually left only with the record developed at trial to determine whether it is possible to say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the jury’s verdict. Moreover, any time an appellate court conducts harmless-error review it necessarily engages in some speculation as to the jury’s decisionmaking process; for in the end no judge can know for certain what factors led to the jury’s verdict. Cf. <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>481 U. S. 497, 503, n. 6 (1987). Yet harmless-error review has become an integral component of our criminal justice system. See <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U. S. 673, 681 (1986); <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18, 22 (1967).</p>
<p id="b332-6">Despite these lingering doubts, I accept the Court’s conclusion that a constitutionally deficient reasonable-doubt instruction is a breed apart from the many other instructional errors that we have held <em>are </em>amenable to harmless-error analysis. See, <em>e.g., Carella </em>v. <em>California, </em>491 U. S. 263 (1989) <em>(per curiam) </em>(instruction containing erroneous conclusive presumption); <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra </em>(instruction misstating an element of the offense); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, supra </em>(instruction containing erroneous burden-shifting presump<page-number citation-index="1" label="285">*285</page-number>tion). A constitutionally deficient reasonable-doubt instruction will always result in the absence of “beyond a reasonable doubt” jury findings. That being the case, I agree that harmless-error analysis cannot be applied in the case of a defective reasonable-doubt instruction consistent with the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee. I join the Court’s opinion.</p>
