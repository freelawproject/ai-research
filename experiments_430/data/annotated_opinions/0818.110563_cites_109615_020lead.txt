 Mont. Const., Art. IX, § 5.  Appellants, 4 Montana coal producers and 11 of their out-of-state utility company customers, filed these suits in Montana state court in 1978.  They sought refunds of over $5.4 million in severance taxes paid under protest, a declaration that the tax is invalid under the Supremacy and Commerce Clauses, and an injunction against further collection of the tax. Without receiving any evidence, the court upheld the tax and dismissed the complaints.  On appeal, the Montana Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. -Mont.-, 615 P. 2d 847 (1980).  The Supreme Court held that the tax is not subject to scrutiny under the Commerce Clause 2 because it is imposed on the severance of coal, which the court characterized as an intrastate activity preceding entry of the coal into interstate *614 commerce.  In this regard, the Montana court relied on this Court’s decisions in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245 (1922), Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, 262 U. S. 172 (1923), and Hope Natural Gas Co. v. Hall, 274 U. S. 284 (1927), which employed similar reasoning in upholding state severance taxes against Commerce Clause challenges.  As an alternative basis for its resolution of the Commerce Clause issue, the Montana court held, as a matter of law, that the tax survives scrutiny under the four-part test articulated by this Court in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 274</citedDecision> (1977).  The Montana court also rejected appellants’ Supremacy Clause 3 challenge, concluding that appellants had failed to show that the Montana tax conflicts with any federal statute.  We noted probable jurisdiction, 449 TJ. S. 1033 (1980), to consider the important issues raised.  We now affirm.  II A As an initial matter, appellants assert that the Montana Supreme Court erred in concluding that the Montana tax is not subject to the strictures of the Commerce Clause.  In appellants’ view, Heisler’s “mechanical” approach, which looks to whether a state tax is levied on goods prior to their entry into interstate commerce, no longer accurately reflects the law. Appellants contend that the correct analysis focuses on whether the challenged tax substantially affects interstate commerce, in which case it must be scrutinized under the Complete Auto Transit test.  We agree that Heisler’s reasoning has been undermined by more recent cases. The Heisler analysis evolved at a time when the Commerce Clause was thought to prohibit the States from imposing any direct taxes on interstate commerce.  *615 See, e. g., Helson & Randolph v. Kentucky, 279 U. S. 245, 250-252 (1929); Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v. Monier, 266 U. S. 555, 562 (1925).  Consequently, the distinction between intrastate activities and interstate commerce was crucial to protecting the States’ taxing power.  4 The Court has, however, long since rejected any suggestion that a state tax or regulation affecting interstate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches only to a “local” or intrastate activity.  See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333, 350 (1977); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 141-142 (1970); Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S. 416, 423-424 (1946).  Correspondingly, the Court has rejected the notion that state taxes levied on interstate commerce are per se invalid.  See, e. g., Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734 (1978); Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. <citedDecision>Brady, supra.</citedDecision> In reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes, our goal has instead been to “establish a consistent and rational method of inquiry” focusing on “the practical effect of a challenged tax.” Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S. 425, 443 (1980).  See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 276-281 (1978); Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedor *616 ing Cos., supra, at 743-751; Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. <citedDecision>Brady, supra, at 277-279</citedDecision> .  We conclude that the same “practical” analysis should apply in reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state severance taxes.  In the first place, there is no real distinction — in terms of economic effects — between severance taxes and other types of state taxes that have been subjected to Commerce Clause scrutiny.  5 See, e. g., Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157 (1954); Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., 330 U. S. 422 (1947), Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n, 302 U. S. 90 (1937), both overruled in Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., supra. 6 State taxes levied on a “local” activity preceding entry of the goods into interstate commerce may substantially affect interstate commerce, and this effect is the proper focus of Commerce Clause inquiry.  See Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, supra, at 443.  Second, this Court has acknowledged that “a State has a significant interest in exacting from interstate commerce its fair share of the cost of state government,” Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., supra, at 748.  As the Court has stated, “ ‘[e]ven interstate business must pay its way.’ ” Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938), quoting Postal Telegraph-Cable *617 Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252, 259 (1919).  Consequently, the Heisler Court’s concern that a loss of state taxing authority would be an inevitable result of subjecting taxes on “local” activities to Commerce Clause scrutiny is no longer tenable.  We therefore hold that a state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce.  Any contrary statements in Heisler and its progeny are disapproved.  7 We agree with appellants that the Montana tax must be evaluated under Complete Auto Transit’s four-part test.  Under that test, a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it “is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.” <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 279</citedDecision> .  B Appellants do not dispute that the Montana tax satisfies the first two prongs of the Complete Auto Transit test.  As the Montana Supreme Court noted, “there can be no argument here that a substantial, in fact, the only nexus of the severance of coal is established in Montana.” -Mont., at-, 615 P. 2d, at 855 .  Nor is there any question here regarding apportionment or potential multiple taxation, for as the state court observed, “the severance can occur in no other state” and “no other state can tax the severance.” Ibid. Appellants do contend, however, that the Montana tax is invalid under the third and fourth prongs of the Complete Auto Transit test.  Appellants assert that the Montana tax “discriminate [s] against interstate commerce” because 90% of Montana coal is shipped to other States under contracts that shift the tax burden primarily to non-Montana utility companies and thus *618 to citizens of other States.  But the Montana tax is computed at the same rate regardless of the final destination of the coal, and there is no suggestion here that the tax is administered in a manner that departs from this evenhanded formula.  We are not, therefore, confronted here with the type of differential tax treatment of interstate and intrastate commerce that the Court has found in other “discrimination” cases. See, e. g., Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725 (1981); Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U. S. 318 (1977); cf. Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27 (1980); Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978).

 As the Court stated in West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229, 255 (1911), “‘in matters of foreign *619 and interstate commerce there are no state lines.’ ” See Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, supra, at 331-332.  Consequently., to accept appellants’ theory and invalidate the Montana tax solely because most of Montana’s coal is shipped across the very state borders that ordinarily are to be considered irrelevant would require a significant and, in our view, unwarranted departure from the rationale of our prior discrimination cases. Furthermore, appellants’ assertion that Montana may not “exploit” its “monopoly” position by exporting tax burdens to other States, cannot rest on a claim that there is need to protect the out-of-state Consumers of Montana coal from discriminatory tax treatment.  As previously noted, there is no real discrimination in this case; the tax burden is borne according to the amount of coal consumed and not according to any distinction between in-state and out-of-state consumers.  Rather, appellants assume that the Commerce Clause gives residents of one State a right of access at “reasonable” prices to resources located in another State that is richly endowed with such resources, without regard to whether and on what terms residents of the resource-rich State have access to the resources.  We are not convinced that the Commerce Clause, of its own force, gives the residents of one State the right to control in this fashion the terms of resource development and depletion .in a sister State.  Cf. Philadelphia v. New Jersey, supra, at 626 .  8 *620 In any event, appellants’ discrimination theory ultimately collapses into their claim that the Montana tax is invalid under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test: that the tax is not “fairly related to the services provided by the State.” <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 279</citedDecision> .  Because appellants concede that Montana may impose some severance tax on coal mined in the State, 9 the only remaining foundation for their discrimination theory is a claim that the tax burden borne by the out-of-state consumers of Montana coal is excessive.  This is, of course, merely a variant of appellants’ assertion that the Montana tax does not satisfy the “fairly related” prong of the Complete Auto Transit test, and it is to this contention that we now turn.  Appellants argue that they are entitled to an opportunity to prove that the amount collected under the Montana tax is not fairly related to the additional costs the State incurs because of coal mining.  10 Thus, appellants’ objection is to *621 the rate of the Montana tax, and even then, their only complaint is that the amount the State receives in taxes far exceeds the value of the services provided to the coal mining industry.  In objecting to the tax on this ground, appellants may be assuming that the Montana tax is, in fact, intended to reimburse the State for the cost of specific services furnished to the coal mining industry.  Alternatively, appellants could be arguing that a State’s power to tax an activity connected to interstate commerce cannot exceed the value of the services specifically provided to the activity.
