 .  .  where the federal interest is demonstrably greater and where state .  .  .  compliance with imposed federal standards would be essential.” 426 U. S., at 856 (Blackmun, J., concurring).  In reading National League of Cities to embrace a balancing approach, Justice Blackmun quite correctly cited the part of the opinion that reaffirmed Fry v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 542</citedDecision> (1975).  The Court’s analysis reaffirming <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> explicitly weighed the seriousness of the problem addressed by the federal legislation at issue in that case, against the effects of compliance on state sovereignty.  426 U. S., at 852-853 .  Our subsequent decisions also adopted this approach of weighing the respective interests of the States and Federal *563 Government.  5 In EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983), for example, the Court stated that “[t]he principle of immunity articulated in National League of Cities is a functional doctrine .  .  .  whose ultimate purpose is not to create a sacred province of state autonomy, but to ensure that the unique benefits of a federal system .

 Indeed, the language of the Clause itself focuses on activities that only a National Government could regulate: commerce with foreign nations and Indian tribes and “among” the several States.  *573 To be sure, this Court has construed the Commerce Clause to accommodate unanticipated changes over the past two centuries.  As these changes have occurred, the Court has had to decide whether the Federal Government has exceeded its authority by regulating activities beyond the capability of a single State to regulate or beyond legitimate federal interests that outweighed the authority and interests of the States.  In so doing, however, the Court properly has been mindful of the essential role of the States in our federal system.  The opinion for the Court in National League of Cities was faithful to history in its understanding of federalism.  The Court observed that “our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of States as States by means of the commerce power.” 426 U. S., at 842 .  The Tenth Amendment was invoked to prevent Congress from exercising its “‘power in a fashion that impairs the States’ integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.’” Id., at 842-843 (quoting <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 547, n. 7</citedDecision> ).  This Court has recognized repeatedly that state sovereignty is a fundamental component of our system of government.  More than a century ago, in Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 (1869), the Court stated that the Constitution recognized “the necessary existence of the States, and, within their proper spheres, the independent authority of the States.” It concluded, as Madison did, that this authority extended to “nearly the whole charge of interior regulation .  .  .  ; to [the States] and to the people all powers not expressly delegated to the national government are reserved.” Id., at 76 .  Recently, in Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U. S. 40, 53 (1982), the Court recognized that the state action exemption from the antitrust laws was based on state sovereignty.  Similarly, in Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S., at 683, although finding the Railway Labor Act applicable to a state-owned railroad, the *574 unanimous Court was careful to say that the States possess constitutionally preserved sovereign powers.  Again, in FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 752 (1982), in determining the constitutionality of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, the Court explicitly considered whether the Act impinged on state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  These represent only a few of the many cases in which the Court has recognized not only the role, but also the importance, of state sovereignty.  See also, e. g., Fry v. United <citedDecision>States, supra;</citedDecision> Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514 (1926); Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  As Justice Frankfurter noted, the States are not merely a factor in the “shifting economic arrangements” of our country, Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 95 (1949) (concurring), but also constitute a “coordinate element in the system established by the Framers for governing our Federal Union.” National League of Cities, supra, at 849.  D In contrast, the Court today propounds a view of federalism that pays only lipservice to the role of the States.  Although it says that the States “unquestionably do 'retai[n] a significant measure of sovereign authority,’” ante, at 549 (quoting EEOC v. Wyoming, supra, at 269 (Powell, J., dissenting)), it fails to recognize the broad, yet specific areas of sovereignty that the Framers intended the States to retain.  Indeed, the Court barely acknowledges that the Tenth Amendment exists.  16 That Amendment states explicitly that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States .  .

 See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 244 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring).  See also, for example, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 688 (1982) (“Congress long ago concluded that federal regulation of railroad labor services is necessary to prevent disruptions in vital rail service essential to the national economy”); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 757 (1982) (“[I]t is difficult to conceive of a more basic element of interstate commerce than electric energy .  .  .  ”).  Similarly, we have considered whether exempting States from federal regulation would undermine the goals of the federal program.  See Fry v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 542</citedDecision> (1975).  See also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 282 (1981) (national surface mining standards necessary to insure competition among States does not undermine States’ efforts to maintain adequate intrastate standards).  On the other hand, we have also assessed the injury done to the States if forced to comply with federal Commerce Clause enactments.  See National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 846-851 .  In addition, reliance on the Court’s difficulties in the tax immunity field is misplaced.  Although the Court has abandoned the “governmental/proprietary” distinction in this field, see New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), it has not taken the drastic approach of relying solely on the structure of the Federal Government to protect the States’ *564 immunity from taxation.

 “Participation is likely to be more frequent, and exercised at more different stages of a governmental activity at the local level, or in regional organizations, than at the state and federal levels.  [Additionally,] the proportion of people actually involved from the total population tends to be greater, the lower the level of govern *576 ment, and this, of course, better approximates the citizen participation ideal.” ACIR, Citizen Participation in the American Federal System 95 (1980).  Moreover, we have witnessed in recent years the rise of numerous special interest groups that engage in sophisticated lobbying, and make substantial campaign contributions to some Members of Congress.  These groups are thought to have significant influence in the shaping and enactment of certain types of legislation.  Contrary to the Court’s view, a “political process” that functions in this way is' unlikely to safeguard the sovereign rights of States and localities.  See n. 9, supra. The opinion of the Court in National League of Cities makes clear that the very essence of a federal system of government is to impose “definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.” 426 U. S., at 842 .  See also the Court’s opinion in Fry v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 542, 547, n. 7</citedDecision> (1975).  As Justice Douglas observed in his dissent in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 203 , extension of the FLSA to the States could “disrupt the fiscal policy of the States and threaten their autonomy in the regulation of health and education.” In Long Island R. Co. the unanimous Court recognized that “[t]his Court’s emphasis on traditional governmental functions and traditional aspects of state sovereignty was not meant to impose a static historical view of state functions generally immune from federal regulation.” 455 U. S.. at 686.
