 *742 After accepting certification, the Supreme Court, with two justices dissenting, affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. 88 Wash. 2d 315 , 559 P. 2d 997 (1977).  The majority considered petitioner’s argument that recent cases 13 had eroded the holdings in the Stevedoring Cases. It concluded, nonetheless: “[W]e must hold the tax invalid; we do so in recognition of our duty to abide by controlling United States Supreme Court decisions construing the federal constitution.  Hence, we find it unnecessary to discuss the aforementioned cases beyond the fact that nowhere in them do we find language criticizing, expressly contradicting, or overruling (even impliedly) the stevedoring cases. “Fully mindful of our prior criticism of the principles and reasoning of the stevedore cases (see Washington-Oregon Shippers Cooperative Ass’n v. Schumacher, 59 Wn. 2d 159 , 167, 367 P. 2d 112 , 115-116 (1961)), we must nevertheless hold the instant tax on stevedoring invalid.” 88 Wash. 2d, at 318-320 , 559 P. 2d, at 998-999 .  The two dissenting justices would have upheld the tax against the Commerce Clause attack on the ground that recent cases had eroded the direct-indirect taxation analysis employed in the Stevedoring Cases. They found no violation of the Import-Export Clause because the State had taxed only the activity of stevedoring, not the imports or exports themselves.  Even if stevedoring were considered part of interstate or foreign commerce, the Washington tax was valid because it did not discriminate against importing or exporting, did not impair transportation, did not impose multiple burdens, and did not *743 regulate commerce.  88 Wash. 2d, at 320-322 , 559 P. 2d, at 999-1000 .  Because of the possible impact on the issues made by our intervening decision in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 274</citedDecision> (1977), filed after the Washington Supreme Court’s ruling, we granted certiorari.  434 U. S. 815 (1977).  II The Commerce Clause A In Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n , the Court invalidated the Washington business and occupation tax on stevedoring only because it applied directly to interstate commerce.  Stevedoring was interstate commerce, according to the Court, because: “Transportation of a cargo by water is impossible or futile unless the thing to be transported is put Aboard the ship and taken off at destination.  A stevedore who in person or by servants does work so indispensable is as much an agency of commerce as shipowner or master.” 302 U. S., at 92 .  Without further analysis, the Court concluded: “The business of loading and unloading being interstate or foreign commerce, the State of Washington is not at liberty to tax the privilege of doing it by exacting in return therefor a percentage of the gross receipts.  Decisions to that effect are many and controlling.” Id., at 94 .

 This separation theory was necessary, said the Court, because it served to diminish the threat of multiple taxation on commerce; if the tax actually fell on intrastate activity, there was less likelihood that other taxing jurisdictions could duplicate the levy.  Id., at 429 .  Stevedoring, however, was not separated from interstate commerce because, as previously enunciated in Puget Sound, it was interstate commerce: “Stevedoring, we conclude, is essentially a part of the commerce itself and therefore a tax upon its gross receipts or upon the privilege of conducting the business of stevedoring for interstate and foreign commerce, measured by those gross receipts, is invalid.  We reaffirm the rule of Puget Sound Stevedoring Company.  What makes the *745 tax invalid is the fact that there is interference by a State with the freedom of interstate commerce.’ Freeman v. Hewit [ 329 U. S. 249 ,] 256.” 330 U. S., at 433 .  Because the tax in the present case is indistinguishable from the taxes at issue in Puget Sound and in Carter & Weekes, the Stevedoring Cases control today’s decision on the Commerce Clause issue unless more recent precedent and a new analysis require rejection of their reasoning.  We conclude that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. <citedDecision>Brady</citedDecision> , where the Court held that a State under appropriate conditions may tax directly the privilege of conducting interstate business, requires such rejection.  In Complete Auto, Mississippi levied a gross-receipts tax on the privilege of doing business within the State.  It applied the tax to the appellant, a Michigan corporation transporting motor vehicles manufactured outside Mississippi.  After the vehicles were shipped into Mississippi by railroad, the appellant moved them by truck to Mississippi dealers.  This Court assumed that appellant’s activity was in interstate commerce.  <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 276</citedDecision> n. 4.  The Mississippi tax survived the Commerce Clause attack.  Absolute immunity from state tax did not exist for interstate businesses because it “ ‘ “was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business.” ’ ” <citedDecision>Id., at 288</citedDecision> , quoting Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S., at 254 , and Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U. S. 100, 108 (1975).  The Court therefore specifically overruled Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O’Connor, 340 U. S. 602 (1951), where a direct gross-receipts tax on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce had been invalidated.  <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 288-289</citedDecision> .  The principles of Complete Auto also lead us now to question the underpinnings of the Stevedoring Cases. First, Puget Sound invalidated the Washington tax on stevedoring activity only because it burdened the privilege of engaging in interstate *746 commerce.  Because Complete Auto permits a State properly to tax the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce, the basis for the holding in Puget Sound is removed completely.  15 Second, Carter & Weekes supported its reaffirmance of Puget Sound by arguing that a direct privilege tax would threaten multiple burdens on interstate commerce to a greater extent than would taxes on local activity connected to commerce.  But Complete Auto recognized that errors of apportionment that may lead to multiple burdens may be corrected when they occur.  <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 288-289, n. 15</citedDecision> .  16 The argument of Carter ■& Weekes was an abstraction.  No multiple burdens were demonstrated.  When a general business tax levies only on the value of services performed within the State, the tax is properly apportioned and multiple bur *747 dens logically cannot occur.  17 The reasoning of Carter & Weekes, therefore, no longer supports automatic tax immunity for stevedoring from a levy such as the Washington business and occupation tax. Third, Carter & Weekes reaffirmed Puget Sound on a basis rejected by Complete Auto and previous cases. Carter & Weekes considered any direct tax on interstate commerce to be unconstitutional because it burdened or interfered with commerce.  330 U. S., at 433 .  In support of that conclusion, the Court there cited only Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761, 767 (1945), the case where Arizona’s limitations on the length of trains were invalidated.

 .  .  .” Id., at 775-776 .  Only after concluding that railroad safety was not advanced by the regulations, did the Court invalidate them.  They contravened the Commerce Clause because the burden on interstate commerce outweighed the State’s interests.  *748 Although the balancing of safety interests naturally differs from the balancing of state financial needs, Complete Auto recognized that a State has a significant interest in exacting from interstate commerce its fair share of the cost of state government.  <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 288</citedDecision> .  Accord, Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U. S., at 108 ; Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S., at 254 .  All tax burdens do not impermissibly impede interstate commerce.  The Commerce Clause balance tips against the tax only when it unfairly burdens commerce by exacting more than a just share from the interstate activity.  Again, then, the analysis of Carter & Weekes must be rejected.  B Respondents’ additional arguments do not demonstrate the wisdom of, or need for, preserving the Stevedoring Cases. First, respondents attempt to distinguish so-called movement cases, in which tax immunity has been broad, from nonmovement cases, in which the immunity traditionally has been narrower.  Brief for Respondents 23-28.
**Lead Opinion**
 Nonmovement cases involve taxation on commerce that does not move goods, such as the New Mexico tax on publishing newspapers and magazines in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue .  This distinction, however, disregards Complete Auto, a movement case which held that a state privilege tax oar the business of moving goods in interstate commerce is not per se unconstitutional.  Second, respondents would distinguish Complete Auto on the ground that it concerned only intrastate commerce, that is, the movement of vehicles from a Mississippi railhead to Mississippi dealers.  Brief for Respondents 26-28.  This purported distinction ignores two facts.  In Complete Auto, we expressly assumed that the activity was interstate, a segment of the movement of vehicles from the out-of-state manufac *749 turer to the in-state dealers.  <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 276</citedDecision> n. 4.  Moreover, the stevedoring activity of respondents occurs completely within the State of Washington, even though the activity is a part of interstate or foreign commerce.  The situation was the same in Complete Auto, and that case, thus, is not distinguishable from the present one.  Third, respondents suggest that what they regard as such an important change in Commerce Clause jurisprudence should come from Congress and not from this Court. To begin with, our rejection of the Stevedoring Cases does not effect a significant present change in the law. The primary alteration occurred in Complete Auto. Even if this case did effect an important change, it would not offend the sepa.ration-of-powers principle because it does not restrict the ability of Congress to regulate commerce.  The Commerce Clause does not state a prohibition; it merely grants specific power to Congress.  The prohibitive effect of the Clause on state legislation results from the Supremacy Clause and the decisions of this Court. See, e. g., Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1852); Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824).  If Congress prefers less disruption of interstate commerce, it will act.  18 Consistent with Complete Auto, then, we hold that the Washington business and occupation tax does not violate the *750 Commerce Clause by taxing the interstate commerce activity of stevedoring.  To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. stand to the contrary, each is overruled.  C With the distinction between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce thus discarded, the constitutionality under the Commerce Clause of the application of the Washington business and occupation tax to stevedoring depends upon the practical effect of the exaction.  As was recognized in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938), interstate commerce must bear its fair share of the state tax burden.  The Court repeatedly has sustained taxes that are applied to activity with a substantial nexus with the State, that are fairly apportioned, that do not discriminate against interstate commerce, and that are fairly related to the services provided by the State.  E. g., General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436 (1964); Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959); Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, 335 U. S. 80 (1948); Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435 (1940); see Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 279</citedDecision> , and n. 8.  Respondents proved no facts in the Superior Court that, under the above test, would justify invalidation of the Washington tax. The record contains nothing that minimizes the obvious nexus between Washington and respondents; indeed, respondents conduct their entire stevedoring operations within the State.  Nor have respondents successfully attacked the apportionment of the Washington system.  The tax under challenge was levied solely on the value of the loading and unloading that occurred in Washington.  Although the rate of taxation varies with the type of business activity, respondents have not demonstrated how the 1% rate, which applies to them and generally to businesses rendering services, discriminates against interstate commerce.  Finally, nothing in the *751 record suggests that the tax is not fairly related to services and protection provided by the State.  In short, because respondents relied below on the per se approach of Puget Sound and Carter & Weekes, they developed no factual basis on which to declare the Washington tax unconstitutional as applied to their members and their stevedoring activities.

 In a reply brief, respondents supported the continuing validity of the Stevedoring Cases. In particular, they argued: “Final, and we think conclusive, proof of the continued vitality of the stevedoring cases lies in the language of Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O’Connor , 340 II.  S. 602 .  .  .  (1951), decided after all four of the ‘major’ cases relied on by the State.  We have previously noted that Spector struck down a tax on the activity of moving goods in interstate commerce.” Record 69 (emphasis in original).  Spector was overruled last Term in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 274, 288-289</citedDecision> (1977), decided after respondents advanced the above argument.  In its oral decision the Superior Court noted its doubt about the continued validity of the Stevedoring Cases: “It would seem to the Court .  .  .  that there certainly is a swing away from the Puget Sound and Carter and Weekes cases .  .  .
**Concurrence Opinion**
 As that section of the Court’s opinion appears to *762 resurrect the discarded “direct-indirect” test, I cannot join it.  In Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276 (1976), this Court abandoned the traditional, formalistic methods of determining the validity of state levies under the Import-Export Clause and applied a functional analysis based on the exaction’s relationship to the three policies that underlie the Clause: (i) preservation of uniform federal regulation of foreign relations; (ii) protection of federal revenue derived from imports; and (iii) maintenance of harmony among the inland States and the seaboard States.  The nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax in Michelin was held not to violate any of those policies, but the Court suggested that even a nondiscriminatory tax on goods merely in transit through the State might run afoul of the Import-Export Clause.  The question the Court addresses today in Part III-B is whether the business tax at issue here is such a tax upon goods in transit.  The Court gives a negative answer, apparently for two reasons.  The first is that Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511 (1951), indicates that this is a tax “not on the goods but on the handling of them at the port.” Id., at 514 (emphasis in original).  While Canton R. Co. provides precedential support for the proposition that a tax of this kind is not invalid under the Import-Export Clause, its rather artificial distinction between taxes on the handling of the goods and taxes on the goods themselves harks back to the arid “direct-indirect” distinction that we rejected in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, <citedDecision>430 U. S., 274</citedDecision> (1977), in favor of analysis framed in light of economic reality.  The Court’s second reason for holding that the instant tax is not one on goods in transit has the surface appearance of economic-reality analysis, but turns out to be the “direct-indirect” test in another guise.  The Court likens this tax to the one at issue in Canton R. Co. and declares that since “ [t] axation in neither setting relates to the value of the goods,... in neither can it be considered taxation upon the goods themselves.” *763 Ante, at 757.  That this distinction has no economic significance is apparent from the fact that it is possible to design transit fees that are imposed “directly” upon the goods, even though the amount of the exaction bears no relation to the value of the goods.  For example, a State could levy a transit fee of $5 per ton or $10 per cubic yard.  These taxes would bear no more relation to the value of the goods than does the tax at issue here, which is based on the volume of the stevedoring companies’ business, and, in turn, on the volume of goods passing through the port. Thus, the Court does not explain satisfactorily its pronouncement that Washington’s business tax upon stevedoring — in economic terms — is not the type of transit fee that the Michelin Court questioned.  In my view, this issue can be resolved only with reference to the analysis adopted in Michelin.
