**Lead Opinion**
 Since the future importance of the conviction may well turn on issues of state law about which we are not well informed, we propose, on direct appeal from the Maryland courts, to accept their judgment on this question.  Since *793 they decided this federal constitutional question, we see no reason why we should not do so as well.  Moreover, the status of petitioner’s burglary conviction and the eventual length of his sentence are both still in some doubt.  10 Should any attack on the burglary conviction be successful, or should the length of the burglary sentence be reduced to less than five years, petitioner would then clearly have a right to have his larceny conviction reviewed.  As we said in Sibron v. New York, supra, at 56-57, it is certainly preferable to have that review now on direct appeal, rather than later.  11 For these reasons, and because there is no jurisdictional bar, we find it appropriate to reach the questions specified in our original writ of certiorari.  III. In 1937, this Court decided the landmark case of Palko v. Connecticut, <citedDecision>302 U. S. 319</citedDecision> .  Palko, although indicted for first-degree murder, had been convicted of murder in the second degree after a jury trial in a Connecticut state court. The State appealed and won a new trial. Palko argued that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated, as against the States, the Fifth Amendment requirement that no person “be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” The Court disagreed.  Federal double jeopardy standards were not applicable against the States.  Only when a kind of jeopardy subjected a defendant to “a hardship so acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it,” <citedDecision>id., at 328</citedDecision> , did the Fourteenth Amendment apply.  The order *794 for a new trial was affirmed.  In subsequent appeals from state courts, the Court continued to apply this lesser <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> standard.  See, e. g., Brock v. North Carolina, 344 U. S. 424 (1953).  Recently, however, this Court has “increasingly looked to the specific guarantees of the [Bill of Rights] to determine whether a state criminal trial was conducted with due process of law.” Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 18 (1967).  In an increasing number of cases, the Court “has rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a ‘watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights ....’” Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10-11 (1964) , 12 Only last Term we found that the right to trial by jury in criminal cases was “fundamental to the American scheme of justice,” Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  13 For the same reasons, we today find that the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents a fundamental ideal in our constitutional heritage, and that it should apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Insofar as it is inconsistent with this holding, <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Connecticut</citedDecision> is overruled.  <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> represented an approach to basic constitutional rights which this Court’s recent decisions have rejected.  It was cut of the same cloth as Betts v. Brady, 316 IT.  S. 455 (1942), the case which held that a criminal defendant’s right to counsel was to be determined by deciding in each case whether the denial of that right was “shocking to the universal sense of justice.” <citedDecision>Id., at 462</citedDecision> .  It *795 relied upon Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908), which held that the right against compulsory self-incrimination was not an element of Fourteenth Amendment due process.  Betts was overruled by Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963); Twining , by Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964).  Our recent cases have thoroughly rejected the <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> notion that basic constitutional rights can be denied by the States as long as the totality of the circumstances does not disclose a denial of “fundamental fairness.” Once it is decided that a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is “fundamental to the American scheme of justice,” Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, at 149 , the same constitutional standards apply against both the State and Federal Governments.  Palko’s roots had thus been cut away years ago.  We today only recognize the inevitable.  The fundamental nature of the guarantee against double jeopardy can hardly be doubted.  Its origins can be traced to Greek and Roman times, and it became established in the common law of England long before this Nation’s independence.  14 See Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, 151-155 (1959) (Black, J., dissenting).  As with many other elements of the common law, it was carried into the jurisprudence of this Country through the medium of Blackstone, who codified the doctrine in his Commentaries.  “[T]he plea of autrefoits acquit, or a former acquittal,” he wrote, “is grounded on this universal maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life more than once for the same offence.” 15 Today, every State incorporates some form of the prohibition in its constitution or common law. 16 As this Court put it in Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187-188 (1957), “[t]he underlying *796 idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.” This underlying notion has from the very beginning been part of our constitutional tradition.  Like the right to trial by jury, it is clearly “fundamental to the American scheme of justice.” The validity of petitioner’s larceny conviction must be judged, not by the watered-down standard enunciated in <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> , but under this Court’s interpretations of the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy provision.  IV. It is clear that petitioner’s larceny conviction cannot stand once federal double jeopardy standards are applied.  Petitioner was acquitted of larceny in his first trial. Because he decided to appeal his burglary conviction, he is forced to suffer retrial on the larceny count as well.  As this Court held in Green v. United States, supra, at 193— 194, “[conditioning an appeal of one offense on a coerced surrender of a valid plea of former jeopardy on another offense exacts a forfeiture in plain conflict with the constitutional bar against double jeopardy.” Maryland argues that Green does not apply to this case because petitioner’s original indictment was absolutely void.  One cannot be placed in “jeopardy” by a void indictment, the State argues.  This argument sounds a bit strange, however, since petitioner could quietly have served out his sentence under this “void” indictment had he not appealed his burglary conviction.  Only by accepting the option of a new trial could the in *797 dictment be set aside; at worst the indictment would seem only voidable at the defendant’s option, not absolutely void.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice White, concurring. While I agree with the Court’s extension of the prohibition against double jeopardy to the States, and with the Court’s conclusion that the concurrent sentence rule constitutes no jurisdictional bar, additional comment on the wisdom and effects of applying a concurrent sentence rule seems appropriate. In a time of increasingly congested judicial dockets, often requiring long delays before trial and upon appeal, *799 judicial resources have become scarce. Where a man has been convicted on several counts and sentenced concurrently upon each, and where judicial review of one count sustains its validity, the need for review of the other counts is not a pressing one since, regardless of the outcome, the prisoner will remain in jail for the same length of time under the count upheld. Rather than permit other cases to languish while careful review of these redundant counts is carried to its futile conclusion, judicial resources might be better employed by moving on to more pressing business. This is not a rule of convenience to the judge, but rather of fairness to other litigants. This is not to say, however, that the fact of conviction under the unreviewed counts could never be of importance to the prisoner. After his release it is possible they might be used against him in a recidivism prosecution, or used to impeach his testimony in a trial for another offense, to pick two obvious examples. Nevertheless, the unreviewed counts are, by hypothesis, not of immediate importance to his confinement, and our experience gives us no indication that they are frequently of such importance later that the concurrent sentence rule should not be applied. The unreviewed count is often one which, but for the concurrent sentence rule, the prisoner would have a right to challenge, either directly or on collateral attack. Arguably, to deny him that right when another man, convicted after a separate trial on each count, or sentenced consecutively, could not be denied that right under the applicable state or federal law, raises an equal protection question. But clearly so long as the denied review is of no significance to the prisoner the denial of equal protection is not invidious but only theoretical. But should a situation arise in which the convict can demonstrate that the unreviewed count is being used *800 against him, so as to work some harm to him additional to that stemming from the reviewed count, his grievance becomes real. At that point it may be that the unreviewed count may not be used against him, unless it is determined that the lack of earlier review can be cured by then supplying the convict the review to which he would earlier have been entitled but for his concurrent sentence on another count. For myself, postponed review, a question which the Court reserves {ante, at 791, n. 7), presents no insuperable difficulties. Appellate review is always conducted on a cold record, and collateral proceedings frequently deal with a stale record and stale facts. There is nothing inherently unfair in permitting the record to become colder while it is irrelevant to any human need, and other litigants’ demands are more pressing. Whether reversal on such a record, after delayed review, would permit retrial or a hearing on a claim involving, for example, a coerced confession, is yet a further question which there is no present need to address. Should a satisfactory hearing or retrial prove impossible this would be an unfortunate byproduct of an initially crowded docket. For the foregoing reasons, I agree with the Court that the concurrent sentence rule, while not of jurisdictional dimensions, should be preserved as a matter of proper judicial administration both on direct appeal and collateral attack, although at least in theory it raises a number of questions concerning the subsequent effects of the unreviewed counts. It may be that where it can be reliably predicted in a particular case that each count would entail concrete prejudicial consequences at a later date, the appellate court at the time of initial review would prefer to deal with all counts rather than to apply the concurrent sentence rule.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Rebanee upon that doctrine would enable the Court to avoid decision of a substantial constitutional question.  Accordingly, I would apply the concurrent sentence rule and decline to review petitioner’s larceny conviction.  Since the case was brought here on a writ of certiorari limited to the “double jeopardy” question, decision of which would affect only the larceny conviction, I would dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.  II.  Having concluded that the writ should be dismissed, I would ordinarily not go further.  However, as indicated at the outset, I feel impelled to continue with *808 some observations respecting what can only be regarded as a complete overruling of one of this Court’s truly great decisions, and with an expression of my views as to how petitioner’s claim respecting his retrial for larceny should fare under the traditional due process approach.  A. I would hold, in accordance with Palko v. Connecticut, <citedDecision>302 U. S. 319</citedDecision> (1937), that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not take over the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth, as such.  Today <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> becomes another casualty in the so far unchecked march toward “incorporating” much, if not all, of the Federal Bill of Rights into the Due Process Clause.  This march began, with a Court majority, in 1961 when Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , was decided and, before the present decision, found its last stopping point in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), decided at the end of last Term. I have at each step in the march expressed my opposition, see, e. g., my opinions in Mapp v. Ohio, supra, at 672 (dissenting); Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 44 (1963) (concurring in result); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 14 (1964) (dissenting); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 408 (1965) (concurring in result); Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 615 (1965) (concurring); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226 (1967) (concurring in result); and Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, at 171 (dissenting); more particularly in the Duncan case 1 undertook to show that the “selective incorporation” doctrine finds no support either in history or in reason.  12 Under the pressures of the closing days of *809 the Term, I am content to rest on what I have written in prior opinions, save to raise my voice again in protest against a doctrine which so subtly, yet profoundly, is eroding many of the basics of our federal system.  More broadly, that this Court should have apparently become so impervious to the pervasive wisdom of the constitutional philosophy embodied in <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> , and that it should have felt itself able to attribute to the perceptive and timeless words of Mr. Justice Cardozo nothing more than a “watering down” of constitutional rights, are indeed revealing symbols of the extent to which we are weighing anchors from the fundamentals of our constitutional system.  B. Finally, how should the validity of petitioner’s larceny conviction be judged under <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> , that is, under due process standards?  A brief recapitulation of the facts first seems advisable.  Petitioner was indicted and tried simultaneously for burglary and larceny.  He was acquitted of larceny but convicted of burglary.  Petitioner appealed, and the Maryland courts remanded in light of earlier Maryland decisions holding invalid a provision of the Maryland Constitution requiring that grand and petit jurors declare their belief in God.  Petitioner was given the option either of accepting the result of his trial or of demanding re-indictment and retrial.  He chose to attack the indictment, was re-indicted and retried for both larceny and burglary, and was convicted of both offenses.  The principle that an accused should not be tried twice for the same offense is deeply rooted in Anglo-American *810 law. 13 In this country, it is presently embodied in the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and in the constitution or common law of every State.  14 The <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> Court found it unnecessary to decide “[w]hat the answer would have to be if the state were permitted after a trial free from error to try the accused over again or to bring another case against him .  .  .  .” <citedDecision>302 U. S., at 328</citedDecision> .  However, I have no hesitation in stating that it would be a denial of due process at least for a State to retry one previously acquitted following an errorless trial. The idea that the State’s interest in convicting wrongdoers is entirely satisfied by one fair trial ending in an acquittal, and that the accused’s interest in repose must thereafter be given precedence, is indubitably a “ ‘principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.’ ” <citedDecision>Id., at 325</citedDecision> .  The situation in this case is not quite so simple.  Had petitioner not appealed his burglary conviction, the State would surely have allowed him to rest on his larceny acquittal and merely serve out his burglary sentence.  However, the State argues that the burglary and larceny counts were originally contained in a single indictment; that upon petitioner’s appeal the indictment was declared totally void and the trial court found to have lacked jurisdiction; and that the State could then proceed as if there had never been a previous indictment or trial. The State’s contention that petitioner’s first trial was a complete nullity because the trial court “lacked juris *811 diction” is unconvincing.  As has been noted, it appears that the State would willingly have seen petitioner serve out the burglary sentence imposed in consequence of that trial. Under state procedure, petitioner could avail himself of the “jurisdictional” defect only by appealing his conviction.  The crucial issue, therefore, is what legitimate interest had the State in compelling petitioner to jeopardize his larceny acquittal as a condition of appealing his burglary conviction?  I can perceive no legitimate state interest.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 15 Trono apparently dictated the result in Brantley v. Georgia, 217 U. S. 284 (1910), in which the Court held in a brief per curiam, without citing any authority, that a Georgia retrial and conviction for murder following the reversal on appeal of an earlier manslaughter conviction did not amount to “a case of twice in jeopardy under any view of the Constitution of the United States.” Id., at 285 .  16 We have since *812 recognized that the “waiver” rationale is a “conceptual abstraction” which obscures rather than illuminates the underlying clash of societal and individual interests.  See United States v. Tateo, 377 U. S. 463, 466 (1964).  Accordingly, I do not think that the reasoning in Trono or the apparent holding in Brantley , insofar as they would require affirmance of petitioner’s larceny conviction, can any longer be regarded as good law. Nor did the State in the present case have the sorts of interests which have been held to justify retrial for the same offense after a conviction has been reversed on appeal by the accused and in the more unusual case when an acquittal has been set aside following an appeal by the State.  17 When the accused has obtained a reversal on appeal, the societal interest in convicting the guilty has been deemed too weighty to permit every such accused to be “granted immunity from punishment because of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction.” United States v. Tateo, supra, at 466 .  The rationale for allowing the State to appeal an acquittal has been that the State, like the accused, is entitled to assure itself of a trial “free from the corrosion of substantial legal error” which might have produced an adverse verdict.  See <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Connecticut, supra, at 328</citedDecision> .  18 *813 In the present case, the State did not appeal, and the defect in the composition of the grand jury could not have affected petitioner’s subsequent acquittal at trial. Society’s legitimate interest in punishing wrongdoers could have been fully vindicated by retrying petitioner on the burglary count alone, that being the offense of which he was previously convicted.  The State had no more interest in compelling petitioner to stand trial again for larceny, of which he had been acquitted, than in retrying any other person declared innocent after an error-free trial. His retrial on the larceny count therefore, in my opinion, denied due process, and on that ground reversal would be called for under <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> .  See Memorandum for the United States as Amicus Curiae 20-23.  Counsel for the Government estimated during oral argument that the concurrent sentence doctrine is employed in the disposition of about 10% of all federal criminal appeals.  See, e. g., Carrington, Crowded Dockets and the Courts of Appeals: The Threat to the Function of Review and the National Law, 82 Harv. L. Rev. 542 (1969).  Like the Court, see ante, at 791, n. 7, I express no view on the question whether collateral consequences may constitutionally be imposed on account of a conviction which was denied review on direct appeal because of the concurrent sentence doctrine.  This Court said in dictum in Hoag v. New Jersey, 356 U. S. 464, 471 (1958): “Despite its wide employment, we entertain grave doubts whether collateral estoppel can be regarded as a constitutional *804 requirement.  Certainly this Court has never so held.” See also id., at 470-471 ; Sealfon v. United States, 332 U. S. 575 (1948); United States v. Oppenheimer, 242 U. S. 85, 88 (1916).
**Combined Opinion**
 Since the future importance of the conviction may well turn on issues of state law about which we are not well informed, we propose, on direct appeal from the Maryland courts, to accept their judgment on this question.  Since *793 they decided this federal constitutional question, we see no reason why we should not do so as well.  Moreover, the status of petitioner's burglary conviction and the eventual length of his sentence are both still in some doubt.  [10] Should any attack on the burglary conviction be successful, or should the length of the burglary sentence be reduced to less than five years, petitioner would then clearly have a right to have his larceny conviction reviewed.  As we said in Sibron v. New York, supra, at 56-57, it is certainly preferable to have that review now on direct appeal, rather than later.  [11] For these reasons, and because there is no jurisdictional bar, we find it appropriate to reach the questions specified in our original writ of certiorari.  III. In 1937, this Court decided the landmark case of Palko v. Connecticut, <citedDecision>302 U. S. 319</citedDecision> .

Only when a kind of jeopardy subjected a defendant to "a hardship so acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it," <citedDecision>id., at 328</citedDecision> , did the Fourteenth Amendment apply.  The order *794 for a new trial was affirmed.  In subsequent appeals from state courts, the Court continued to apply this lesser <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> standard.  See, e. g., Brock v. North Carolina, 344 U. S. 424 (1953).  Recently, however, this Court has "increasingly looked to the specific guarantees of the [Bill of Rights] to determine whether a state criminal trial was conducted with due process of law." Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 18 (1967).  In an increasing number of cases, the Court "has rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a `watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights .  .  .  .' " Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10-11 (1964).  [12] Only last Term we found that the right to trial by jury in criminal cases was "fundamental to the American scheme of justice," Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  [13] For the same reasons, we today find that the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents a fundamental ideal in our constitutional heritage, and that it should apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Insofar as it is inconsistent with this holding, <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Connecticut</citedDecision> is overruled.  Palko represented an approach to basic constitutional rights which this Court's recent decisions have rejected.  It was cut of the same cloth as Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942), the case which held that a criminal defendant's right to counsel was to be determined by deciding in each case whether the denial of that right was "shocking to the universal sense of justice." Id., at 462 .  It *795 relied upon Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908), which held that the right against compulsory self-incrimination was not an element of Fourteenth Amendment due process.  Betts was overruled by Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963); Twining , by Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964).  Our recent cases have thoroughly rejected the <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> notion that basic constitutional rights can be denied by the States as long as the totality of the circumstances does not disclose a denial of "fundamental fairness." Once it is decided that a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is "fundamental to the American scheme of justice," Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, at 149 , the same constitutional standards apply against both the State and Federal Governments.  <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> 's roots had thus been cut away years ago.  We today only recognize the inevitable.  The fundamental nature of the guarantee against double jeopardy can hardly be doubted.  Its origins can be traced to Greek and Roman times, and it became established in the common law of England long before this Nation's independence.  [14] See Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, 151-155 (1959) (BLACK, J., dissenting).  As with many other elements of the common law, it was carried into the jurisprudence of this Country through the medium of Blackstone, who codified the doctrine in his Commentaries.  "[T]he plea of autrefoits acquit, or a former acquittal," he wrote, "is grounded on this universal maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life more than once for the same offence." [15] Today, every State incorporates some form of the prohibition in its constitution or common law. [16] As this Court put it in Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187-188 (1957), "[t]he underlying *796 idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty." This underlying notion has from the very beginning been part of our constitutional tradition.  Like the right to trial by jury, it is clearly "fundamental to the American scheme of justice." The validity of petitioner's larceny conviction must be judged, not by the watered-down standard enunciated in <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> , but under this Court's interpretations of the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy provision.  IV. It is clear that petitioner's larceny conviction cannot stand once federal double jeopardy standards are applied.  Petitioner was acquitted of larceny in his first trial. Because he decided to appeal his burglary conviction, he is forced to suffer retrial on the larceny count as well.  As this Court held in Green v. United States, supra, at 193-194, "[c]onditioning an appeal of one offense on a coerced surrender of a valid plea of former jeopardy on another offense exacts a forfeiture in plain conflict with the constitutional bar against double jeopardy." Maryland argues that Green does not apply to this case because petitioner's original indictment was absolutely void.  One cannot be placed in "jeopardy" by a void indictment, the State argues.  This argument sounds a bit strange, however, since petitioner could quietly have served out his sentence under this "void" indictment had he not appealed his burglary conviction.

However, the State argues that the burglary and larceny counts were originally contained in a single indictment; that upon petitioner's appeal the indictment was declared totally void and the trial court found to have lacked jurisdiction; and that the State could then proceed as if there had never been a previous indictment or trial. The State's contention that petitioner's first trial was a complete nullity because the trial court "lacked jurisdiction" *811 is unconvincing.  As has been noted, it appears that the State would willingly have seen petitioner serve out the burglary sentence imposed in consequence of that trial. Under state procedure, petitioner could avail himself of the "jurisdictional" defect only by appealing his conviction.  The crucial issue, therefore, is what legitimate interest had the State in compelling petitioner to jeopardize his larceny acquittal as a condition of appealing his burglary conviction?  I can perceive no legitimate state interest.
**Combined Opinion**
 [16] We have since *812 recognized that the "waiver" rationale is a "conceptual abstraction" which obscures rather than illuminates the underlying clash of societal and individual interests.  See United States v. Tateo, 377 U. S. 463, 466 (1964).  Accordingly, I do not think that the reasoning in Trono or the apparent holding in Brantley , insofar as they would require affirmance of petitioner's larceny conviction, can any longer be regarded as good law. Nor did the State in the present case have the sorts of interests which have been held to justify retrial for the same offense after a conviction has been reversed on appeal by the accused and in the more unusual case when an acquittal has been set aside following an appeal by the State.  [17] When the accused has obtained a reversal on appeal, the societal interest in convicting the guilty has been deemed too weighty to permit every such accused to be "granted immunity from punishment because of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction." United States v. Tateo, supra, at 466 .  The rationale for allowing the State to appeal an acquittal has been that the State, like the accused, is entitled to assure itself of a trial "free from the corrosion of substantial legal error" which might have produced an adverse verdict.  See <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Connecticut, supra, at 328</citedDecision> .  [18] *813 In the present case, the State did not appeal, and the defect in the composition of the grand jury could not have affected petitioner's subsequent acquittal at trial. Society's legitimate interest in punishing wrongdoers could have been fully vindicated by retrying petitioner on the burglary count alone, that being the offense of which he was previously convicted.  The State had no more interest in compelling petitioner to stand trial again for larceny, of which he had been acquitted, than in retrying any other person declared innocent after an error-free trial. His retrial on the larceny count therefore, in my opinion, denied due process, and on that ground reversal would be called for under <citedDecision>Palko</citedDecision> .  NOTES [1]  The increase in petitioner's sentence on the burglary count from 10 to 15 years is presently the subject of litigation on federal habeas corpus in the lower federal courts.  A federal district court ordered the State to resentence petitioner, Benton v. Copinger, 291 F. Supp. 141 (D. C. Md. 1968), and an appeal brought by the State is presently pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  [2]  See Part V, infra.  Of course, if the error infected both counts upon which petitioner was convicted, there would be no concurrent sentence problem at all. We do not, however, resolve the question of whether the burglary conviction was "tainted." [3]  The length of that sentence is presently a matter in dispute, see n. 1, supra. [4] Grant v. Astle, 2 Doug. 722 , 99 Eng. Rep. 459 (1781); Peake v. Oldham, 1 Cowp. 275, 98 Eng. Rep. 1083 (1775); Rex v. Benfield, 2 Burr. 980, 97 Eng. Rep. 664 (1760).  [5] Street v. New York, 394 U.
