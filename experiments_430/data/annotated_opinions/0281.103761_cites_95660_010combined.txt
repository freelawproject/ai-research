**Combined Opinion**
 It is, of course, true that government contractors obtain certain immunity in connection with work which they do pursuant to their contractual undertaking with the United States.  Yearsley v. Ross Construction Co., 309 U. S. 18 , was a recent example.  In that case the contractor in building dikes in the Missouri River for the United States had washed away a part of the plaintiff’s land.  We held that the contractor was not liable, saying (pp. 20-21) “that if this authority to carry out the project was validly conferred, that is, if what was done was within the constitutional power of Congress, there is no liability on the part of the contractor for executing its will.” But here the situation is quite different.  The question is not whether the Commission had authority to delegate to respondent responsibilities for managing and operating the vessel as its agent.  It is whether respondent can escape liability for a negligent exercise of that delegated power if we assume *584 that by contract it will be exonerated or indemnified for any damages it must pay.  As stated in Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. Emergency Fleet Corp., supra, pp. 566-567, “the general rule is that any person within the jurisdiction always is amenable to the law. If he is sued for conduct harmful to the plaintiff his only shield is a constitutional rule of law that exonerates him.” Furthermore, if the United States were to become the real party in interest by reason of a contract for exoneration or indemnity, a basic alteration in that concept (Minnesota v. Hitchcock, <citedDecision>185 U. S. 373, 387</citedDecision> ) would be made, not pursuant to a Congressional policy 4 but by reason of concessions made by contracting officers of the government.  Such a change would be detrimental to the interests of private claimants, as we have said, since it would subtract from the legal remedies which the law has afforded them.  Beyond that it would make the existence of a right to exoneration or indemnity a jurisdictional fact.  That could hardly help but complicate and delay the enforcement of rights based on these maritime torts.  At least in the absence of a clear Congressional policy to that end, we cannot go so far.  We hold that the Suits in Admiralty Act did not deprive petitioner of the right to sue respondent for dam *585 ages for his .maritime tort.  Whether a cause of action against respondent has been established is, of course, a different question, as the issues involved in Quinn v. Southgate Nelson Corp., supra, indicate.
