**Dissenting Opinion**
 The Natural Gas Act of 1938 should receive application in the light of this analysis, and Mr. Justice Jackson has, I believe, drawn relevant inferences regarding the duty of the Federal Power Commission in fixing natural gas rates.  His exposition seems to me unanswered, and I shall say only a few words to emphasize my basic agreement with him.  For our society the needs that are met by public utilities are as truly public services as the traditional governmental functions of police and justice.  They are not less so when these services are rendered by private enterprise under governmental regulation.  Who ultimately determines the ways of regulation, is the decisive aspect in the public supervision of privately-owned utilities.  Foreshadowed nearly sixty years ago, Railroad Commission Cases, 116 U. S. 307,331 , it was decided more than fifty years ago that the final say under the Constitution lies with the judiciary and not the legislature.  Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 418</citedDecision> .  While legal issues touching the proper distribution of governmental powers under the Constitution may always be raised, Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. <citedDecision>Minnesota, supra,</citedDecision> may fairly be claimed.  But in any event that issue is not here in controversy.  As pointed out in the opinions of my brethren, Congress has given only limited authority to the Federal Power Commission and made the exercise of that authority subject to judicial review.  The Commission is authorized to fix rates chargeable for natural gas.  But the rates that it can fix must be “just and reasonable.” § 5 of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U. S. C. § 717 (d).  Instead of making the Commission’s rate determinations final, Con *626 gress specifically provided for court review of such orders.  To be sure, “the finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence” was made “conclusive,” § 19 of the Act, 15 U. S. C. § 717r.
