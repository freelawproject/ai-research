**Combined Opinion**
 The case did not involve the right to recover against employers under the Jones Act.  Brady was a customs inspector suing for injuries sustained when a ship’s ladder broke.  The opinion said, 317 U. S. at 577 , “The sole question here is whether the Suits in Admiralty Act makes private operators such as respondent nonsuable for their torts.” 9 Cf. Caldarola v. Eckert, 332 U. S. at 159-160 .  As to the second conclusion, we are unable to perceive in the statutes relating to sailors’ rights or the history *790 behind their enactment any legislative purpose to create in seamen employees of the United States through the War Shipping Administration a right to enforce tort claims under the Jones Act against others than their employers or any recognition that such right ever existed.  The Jones Act was welfare legislation that created new rights in seamen for damages arising from maritime torts.  As welfare legislation, this statute is entitled to a liberal construction to accomplish its beneficent purposes.  Compare Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 318 U. S. 724 ; American Stevedores v. Porello, <citedDecision>330 U. S. 446</citedDecision> .  In considering similar legislation in other fields, we have concluded that Congress intended that the purposes of such enactments should not be restricted by common-law concepts of control so as to bar from welfare legislation as independent contractors persons who were as a matter of economic reality a part of the processes and dependent upon the businesses to which they rendered service.  10 The issue in this case is whether a construction- of the Jones Act carrying out the 'intention of Congress to grant those nety rights to seamen against their employers requires or permits a holding that the general agent under the contract here in question is an employer undér the Jones Act.  The decision depends upon the interpretation of the contract between respondent and Cosmopolitan on one hand and that between Cosmopolitan and the United States on the other.  We assume, without deciding, that the rule of the Hearst case applies, that is, the word “employment” should be construed so as to give protection to seamen for torts committed against them by 'those standing in the proximate relation of employer, and the rules of private agency should not be rigorously ap *791 plied.  11 Yet this Court may not disregard the plain and rational meaning of employment and employer to furnish a seaman a cause of action against one completely outside the broadest lines or definitions of employment or employer.  We have no doubt that, under the Jones Act, only one person, firm, or corporation can be sued as employer.

S. 84 , 94: “We are of the opinion that Congress used the words ‘employé’ and ‘employed’ in the statute in their natural sense, and intended to describe the conventional relation , of employer and employe.” Hull v. Philadelphia & Reading R. Co., 252 U. S. 475 .  12 It is much the same type of problem as was presented in Bartels v. Birmingham, 332 U. S. 126 .  There we concluded that the leader and organizer of a traveling orchestra was the employer of the band members rather than the various dance hall proprietors for whom the orchestra performed.  13 Eor a full discussion see the dissent in Hust v. Moore-McCormack, 328 U. S. 707, 744 , and the excerpts from the Senate and House Reports, footnotes 9 and 10.  For the background of the statutory distinctions drawn between public vessels and merchant vessels, see Canadian Aviator, Ltd. v. United States, 324 U. S. 215, 218-22 ; American Stevedores v. Porello, <citedDecision>330 U. S. 446, 450-54</citedDecision> .  14 Although Congress has not enacted legislation to make entirely clear the remedies of W. S. A. seamen against the United States for torts, there has been an effort to do so. H. R. 4873, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., sought to do so by amending the Suits in Admiralty Act, § 5, 41 Stat. 525 , 526, so as to make the remedy in admiralty of that act exclusive as to the same subject matter so as to protect the general agent from suits such as Hust or Caldarola .  The bill was passed by the House June 8, 1948, 94 Cong. Rec. 7388-89, but was not passed by the Senate.  H. R. 483 and 4051 of the 81st Cong., 1st Sess., to the same effect, are.now pending.  In H. R. Rep. No. 2060 on H. R. 4873, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., the Committee on the Judiciary said, p. 2: “Then the Supreme Court on June 23,1947, handed down its decision in Caldarola v. Eckert ( 332 U. S. 155 ), which claifified, in the opinion of the committee, the rule previously announced so as to makd it plain that the agent while liable for the negligence of its own employees was not liable for the negligence of the civil-service masters and crews with whom the United States manned the vessels.  For the negligence of those, the United States was the only responsible party.  The committee believes that litigants should, not be made the victims of the legal confusion regarding the proper remedy ill such cases, and are not responsible for the conditions brought about by the lack of clarity in tt s opinions of the Supreme Court. Legislative relief is requisite not mly to save to litigants possessing meritorious claims their right to 2 day in court, but also to settle the question of remedy in future cas'/s.” 15 Executive Order 9054 of February 7, 1942, issued under the First War Powers Act of December 18, 1941, 55 Stat. 838 .
