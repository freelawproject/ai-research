Case of interest: Union Oil Co. of Cal. v. the San Jacinto (1972)
-----------------------
bution and Division of Damages in Admiralty and Maritime Cases, 45 Calif. L. Rev. 304 (1957).

Other maritime nations enacted provisions similar to Article XIV during the same period, with slight variations in the scope of the rule and the principle of division. Marsden, supra, §§ 119-125. "The principle . . . underlying the rule seems to have been that collision was a peril of the seaa common misfortune to be borne by all parties, either equally or rateably according to their interests at risk." Id., § 140.

Haenn Ship Ceiling & Refitting Corp., 342 U. S. 282, 284. But in neither case did the Court have occasion to re-examine the rule or to appraise the validity of its underpinnings or the propriety of its present application. The Court granted certiorari in Union Oil Co. v. The San Jacinto, <caseOfInterest>409 U. S. 140</caseOfInterest>, to reconsider the divided damages rule, but did not reach the issue because of our conclusion that one of the vessels involved in that case was totally free of contributing fault.

Provided that if, having regard to the circumstances, it is not possible to establish the degree of the respective faults, or if it appears that the faults are equal, the liability shall be apportioned equally."
