 The reach of military law in Britain at the time of the Revolution thus permitted courts-martial only for offenses committed by members of the Armed Forces that had some connection with their military service.  The majority disputes the O’Callahan Court’s suggestion that the British Articles of War forbade the trial of civil offenses by court-martial.  The Court points to Section XIV, Article XVI, of the British Articles of War of 1774, reprinted in G. Davis, Military Law of the United States 581, 593 (3d rev. ed. 1915), which provided: “All Officers and Soldiers are to behave themselves orderly in Quarters, and on their March; and whosoever shall commit any Waste or Spoil either in Walks of Trees, Parks, Warrens, Fish Ponds, Houses or Gardens, Corn Fields, Inclosures or Meadows, or shall maliciously destroy any Property whatsoever belonging to any of Our Subjects, unless by order of the then Commander in Chief of Our Forces, to annoy Rebels or other Enemies in Arms against Us, he or they that shall be found guilty of offending herein shall (besides such Penalties as they are liable to by law) be punished according to the Nature and Degree of the Offence, by the Judgment of a Regimental or General Court Martial.” *459 The majority contends that this provision counters any argument that court-martial jurisdiction in Britain at the time of the American Revolution was in any respect limited to offenses not punishable by civil law. Ante, at 443.  The latter provision, however, appears in a section of the Articles of War captioned “Of Duties in Quarters, in Garrison, or in the Field,” and its text suggests that the activities it forbade were considered derelictions of military duty, and were punishable by court-martial on that basis.  6 American colonists shared the British suspicion of broad military authority in courts-martial.  One of the grievances stated in the Declaration of Independence was King George Ill’s assent to “pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States.” The Framers thus were concerned both with protecting the rights of those subjected to courts-martial, and with preventing courts-martial from permitting soldiers to get away with murder — literally—in the civilian community.  This “known hostility of the American people to any interference by the military with the regular administration of justice in the civil courts,” Coleman v. Tennessee, <citedDecision>97 U. S. 509, 514</citedDecision> (1879), makes it unlikely that the Framers considered any crime committed by a member of the Armed Forces, regardless of *460 its lack of connection to military service, to give rise to a “case arising in” the Armed Forces of the new Nation.  7 This is borne out by provisions in the American Articles of 1776 that are comparable to those in the British Articles of War of 1774.  See Section X, Article I, reprinted in 2 W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 1494 (1896); Section XIII, Article 16, reprinted in 2 Winthrop, supra, at 1497; Section XVIII, Article 5, reprinted in 2 Winthrop, supra, at 1503.  The provisions created military offenses where the crimes involved were service connected.  This tradition continued after the adoption of the Constitution.  With respect to the 1874 Articles of War, for example, Davis wrote: “As to whether an act which is a civil crime is also a military offense no rule can be laid down which will cover all cases, for the reason that what may be a military offense under certain circumstances may lose that character under others.  .

 See Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234, 246-248 (1960) (military dependent in noncapital case); Reid v. Covert, supra, at 19-23 (plurality opinion) (military dependent in capital case); United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 14-15 (1955) (discharged veteran); see also Grisham v. Hagan, 361 U. S. 278 (1960) (civilian military employee in capital case); McElroy v. United States ex rel. Guagliardo, 361 U. S. 281, 286 (1960) (civilian military employee in noncapital case).  Having disposed of these cases on the threshold issue of the reach of the congressional power created by Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, the Court did not consider the limits imposed on the Article I power by the Fifth Amendment.  Several of the remaining cases cited involved crimes committed in the course of the performance of military duties that therefore clearly arose in the Armed Forces.  See Grafton v. United States, supra (murder by Army private serving sentry duty on post); Johnson v. Sayre, supra (embezzlement of United States funds intended for the Naval service); Smith v. Whitney, 116 U. S. 167 (1886) (fraud on Navy contracts).  In Smith , the Court concluded that “such conduct of a naval officer is a case arising in the naval forces, and therefore punishable by court martial under the articles and regulations made or approved by Congress in the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, to provide and maintain a navy, and to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces, without indictment or trial by jury.” Id., at 186 .  The remaining cases cited by the majority are similarly inapposite.  Coleman v. Tennessee, <citedDecision>97 U. S. 509</citedDecision> (1879), dealt with a murder committed by a soldier in time of war.  In Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 (1867), any reference to the reach of court-martial jurisdiction over persons in the Armed Services was dictum, since the holding of that case was that a civilian was improperly subjected to military jurisdiction during the Civil War in a State which had “upheld the authority of the government, and where the courts are open and their process unobstructed.” Id., at 121 .  This attitude is evident in the Petition of Right in 1627, in which the two Houses of Parliament joined in a petition to the Crown to redress four major grievances, the last of which was the trial of soldiers by military commissions.  See J. Tanner, English Constitutional Conflicts of the Seventeenth Century 61-62 (1983 reprint).  The pertinent portion of the Petition stated: “VII.  [WJhereas no offender of what kind soever is exempted from the proceedings to be used, and punishments to be inflicted by the laws and *457 statutes of this your realm: nevertheless of late time divers commissions .  .
