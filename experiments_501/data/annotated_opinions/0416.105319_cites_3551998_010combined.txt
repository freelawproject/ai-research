 .  .  ." Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, ยง 287.150.  The Missouri Supreme Court has read this provision as allowing a common-law action by a worker against a negligent third party, e. g., Schumacher v. Leslie, 360 Mo. 1238 , 232 S. W. 2d 913 , on the theory that the worker may secure common-law recovery against anyone " `upon whom no liability could be entailed under the Act,' " 360 Mo., at 1246 , 232 S. W. 2d, at 918.  But the Missouri Supreme Court has held that a prime contractor is not liable as a third party for his negligence to an employee of a subcontractor.  Bunner v. Patti, <citedDecision>343 Mo. 274</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>121 S. W. 2d 153</citedDecision> ; see also New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Boaz-Kiel Construction Co., 115 F. 2d 950 (C. A. 8th Cir.).  And this because prime contractors are subject to liability under the workmen's compensation statute, which states: "Any person who has work done under contract on or about his premises which is an operation of the usual business which he there carries on shall be deemed an employer and shall be liable under this chapter to such contractor, his subcontractors, and their employees, when injured or killed on or about the premises of the employer .  .  .  .  [T]he immediate contractor .  .

 Presumably, then, Carroll could sue Lanza under either Missouri or Arkansas law for his negligence.  *426 Accordingly, the constitutional question presented should not be passed on.  But we ought not to rest on the initial determination of Missouri law here.  In a number of the full faith and credit cases this Court has remanded for further consideration of state law. E. g., Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., supra ; Griffin v. McCoach, supra ; Clark v. Williard, supra .  Hence, I would remand this case to the Court of Appeals with instructions to determine whether our reading of Missouri law is wrong.  NOTES [1]  The Missouri Supreme Court has construed the Missouri Compensation Act as providing the exclusive remedy, even when, as here, the employee of the subcontractor sues the general contractor for common-law damages.  Bunner v. Patti, <citedDecision>343 Mo. 274, 283</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>121 S. W. 2d 153, 156-157</citedDecision> .  The touchstone seems to be the existence of a Missouri employment contract, such as exists in the present case, wherever the injury may have occurred.  We can find no suggestion in the Missouri cases that the Missouri Compensation Act is not the exclusive remedy against the prime contractor when his contract with the subcontractor is made outside Missouri.  No such suggestion is made by any of the parties to this litigation.  [2]  Hogan and his Indemnity Company, intervenors, were granted a lien on the judgment in favor of Carroll for the amounts paid to Carroll as compensation.  [3]  Article IV, ยง 1 of the Constitution provides: "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.  And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof."
