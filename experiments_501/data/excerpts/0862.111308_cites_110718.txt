 Neither SATS nor SAMTA appears to have attempted to avoid the FLSA’s minimum-wage provisions.  We are informed that basic wage levels in the mass-transit industry traditionally have been well in excess of the minimum wages prescribed by the FLSA.  See Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 7-8.  The District Court also analyzed the status of mass transit under the four-part test devised by the Sixth Circuit in Amersbach v. City of Cleveland, 598 F. 2d 1033 (1979).  In that case, the Court of Appeals looked to (1) whether the function benefits the community as a whole and is made available at little or no expense; (2) whether it is undertaken for public service or pecuniary gain; (3) whether government is its principal provider; and (4) whether government is particularly suited to perform it because of a community-wide need.  Id., at 1037 .  See also, however, Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Assn. v. Abbott Laboratories, 460 U. S. 150, 154, n. 6 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 742, 781</citedDecision> , and n. 7 (1982) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 558 , and n. 2 (1975) (dissenting opinion).  See Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 172 (1911) (“essential”); Helvering v. Therrell, 303 U. S. 218, 225 (1938) (same); Helvering v. Powers, 293 U. S. 214, 225 (1934) (“usual”); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175, 185 (1936) (“activities in which the states have traditionally engaged”); South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 461 (1905) (“strictly governmental”).  In South Carolina , the Court relied on the concept of “strictly governmental” functions to uphold the application of a federal liquor license tax to a state-owned liquor-distribution monopoly.  In Flint , the Court stated: “The true distinction is between .  .  .  those operations of the States essential to the execution of its [sic] governmental functions, and which the State can only do itself, and those activities which are of a private character”; under this standard, “[i]t is no part of the essential governmental functions of a State to provide means of transportation, supply artificial light, water and the like.” 220 U. S., at 172 .

 Due to the emergence of an integrated and industrialized national economy, this Court has been required to examine and review a breathtaking expansion of the powers of Congress.  In doing so the Court correctly perceived that the Framers of our Constitution intended Congress to have sufficient power to address national problems.  But the Framers were not single-minded.  The Constitution is animated by an array of intentions.  EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 265-266 (1983) (Powell, J., dissenting).  Just as surely as the Framers envisioned a National Government capable of solving national problems, they also envisioned a republic whose vitality was assured by the diffusion of power not only among the branches of the Federal Government, but also between the Federal Government and the States.  FERC v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 742, 790</citedDecision> (1982) (O’Connor, J., dissenting).  In the 18th century these intentions did not conflict because technology had not yet converted every local problem into a national one.  A conflict has now emerged, and the Court today retreats rather than reconcile the Constitution’s dual concerns for federalism and an effective commerce power.  *582 We would do well to recall the constitutional basis for federalism and the development of the commerce power which has come to displace it.  The text of the Constitution does not define the precise scope of state authority other than to specify, in the Tenth Amendment, that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are reserved to the States.  In the view of the Framers, however, this did not leave state authority weak or defenseless; the powers delegated to the United States, after all, were “few and defined.” The Federalist No. 45, p. 313 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  The Framers’ comments indicate that the sphere of state activity was to be a significant one, as Justice Powell’s opinion clearly demonstrates, ante at 570-572.

 .  .  always been regarded as exceptional in our polity, an intrusion to be justified by some necessity, the special rather than the ordinary case.” Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government, 54 Colum. L. Rev. 543 , 544-545 (1954).  Today, as federal legislation and coercive grant programs have expanded to embrace innumerable activities that were once viewed as local, the burden of persuasion has surely shifted, and the extraordinary has become ordinary.  See Engdahl, Sense and Nonsense About State Immunity, 2 Constitutional Commentary 93 (1985).  For example, recently the Federal Government has, with this Court’s blessing, undertaken to tell the States the age at which they can retire their law enforcement officers, and the regulatory standards, procedures, and even the agenda which their utilities commissions must consider and follow.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 742</citedDecision> (1982).  The political process *588 has not protected against these encroachments on state activities, even though they directly impinge on a State’s ability to make and enforce its laws.  With the abandonment of National League of Cities , all that stands between the remaining essentials of state sovereignty and Congress is the for self-restraint.  The problems of federalism in an integrated national economy are capable of more responsible resolution than holding that the States as States retain no status apart from that which Congress chooses to let them retain.  The proper resolution, I suggest, lies in weighing state autonomy as a factor in the balance when interpreting the means by which Congress can exercise its authority on the States as States.  It is insufficient, in assessing the validity of congressional regulation of a State pursuant to the commerce power, to ask only whether the same regulation would be valid if enforced against a private party.  That reasoning, embodied in the majority opinion, is inconsistent with the spirit of our Constitution.
