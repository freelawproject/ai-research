. for substantive offenses under the criminal law," 243 U. S., at 543 , so too will it escape the prohibitions of the Double Jeopardy Clause. If, however, it is of such a character as to be subject to these constitutional restrictions, "those things which, as pointed out in In re Chapman . . . , were distinct and did not therefore the one frustrate the otherthe implied legislative authority to compel the giving of testimony and the right criminally to punish for failure to do sowould become one and the same and the exercise of one would therefore be the exertion of, and the exhausting of the right to resort to, the other." Id. , at 547. Marshall thus suggests that application of the Double Jeopardy Clause, like that of other constitutional guarantees, is a function of the type of contempt proceeding at issue. Chapman, it follows, cannot be said to control this case. Rather, whatever application Chapman (and, by implication, Jurney ) might have in the context of judicial contempt is limited to cases of in-court contempts that constitute direct obstructions of the judicial process and for which summary *723 proceedings remain acceptable. Cf. Marshall, supra, at 543. Neither Dixon nor Foster is such a case.

Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U. S. 787 , 800 (1987); Michaelson v. United States ex rel. Chicago, St. P., M. & O. R. Co., 266 U. S. 42 , 65 (1924); Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418 , 450 (1911). It cannot lightly be dismissed. Indeed, we recognized in Young, supra, that contempt "proceedings are not intended to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws. Rather, they are designed to serve the limited purpose of vindicating the authority of the court. In punishing contempt, the Judiciary is sanctioning conduct that *724 violates specific duties imposed by the court itself, arising directly from the parties' participation in judicial proceedings." Id. , at 800. The fact that two criminal prohibitions promote different interests may be indicative of legislative intent and, to that extent, important in deciding whether cumulative punishments imposed in a single prosecution violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. See Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U. S. 359 , 366-368 (1983). But the cases decided today involve instances of successive prosecutions in which the interests of the defendant are of paramount concern. To subject an individual to repeated prosecutions exposes him to "embarrassment, expense and ordeal," Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 , 187 (1957), violates principles of finality, United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332 , 343 (1975), and increases the risk of a mistaken conviction. That one of the punishments is designed to protect the court rather than the public is, in this regard, of scant comfort to the defendant. [2] It is true that the Court has not always given primacy to the defendant's interest.

See also United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313 , 317 (1978); Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13 , 19 (1852). But the dual sovereignty doctrine is limited, by its own terms, to cases where "the two entities that seek successively to prosecute a defendant for the same course of conduct can be termed separate sovereigns." Heath, 474 U. S., at 88 . "This determination," we explained, "turns on whether the two entities draw their authority to punish the offender from distinct sources of power," ibid. , not on whether they are pursuing separate interests. Indeed, the Court has rejected the United States' precise argument in the past, perhaps nowhere more resolutely than in Grafton v. United States, 206 U. S. 333 (1907). In that case, the defendant, a private in the United States Army stationed in the Philippines, was tried before a general court-martial for homicide. Subsequent to Grafton's acquittal, the United States filed a criminal complaint in civil court based on the same acts. Seeking to discredit the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause would be violated by this subsequent prosecution, the Government asserted that "Grafton committed two distinct offensesone against military law and discipline, the other against the civil law which may prescribe the punishment for crimes against organized society by whomsoever those crimes are committed." Id. , at 351. To which the Court responded: "Congress, by express constitutional provision, has the power to prescribe rules for the government and regulation of the Army, but those rules must be interpreted in connection with the prohibition against a man's being put twice in jeopardy for the same offense. . . . If, therefore, a person be tried for an offense in a tribunal deriving *726 its jurisdiction and authority from the United States and is acquitted or convicted, he cannot again be tried for the same offense in another tribunal deriving its jurisdiction and authority from the United States. . . . [T]he same acts constituting a crime against the United States cannot, after the acquittal or conviction of the accused in a court of competent jurisdiction, be made the basis of a second trial of the accused for that crime in the same or in another court, civil or military, of the same government. Congress has chosen, in its discretion, to confer upon general courts-martial authority to try an officer or soldier for any crime, not capital, committed by him in the territory in which he is serving. When that was done the judgment of such military court was placed upon the same level as the judgments of other tribunals when the inquiry arises whether an accused was, in virtue of that judgment, put in jeopardy of life or limb." Id. , at 352. Grafton, and the principle itembodies, are controlling. The Superior Court and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals were created by Congress, pursuant to its power under Article I of the Constitution. See Palmore v. United States, 411 U. S. 389 (1973). In addition, the specific power exercised by the courts in this case were bestowed by the Legislature. See ante, at 691. As we observed in United States v. Providence Journal Co., 485 U. S. 693 (1988), "[t]he fact that the allegedly criminal conduct concerns a violation of a court order instead of common law or a statutory prohibition does not render the prosecution any less an exercise of the sovereign power of the United States." Id. , at 700. It is past dispute, in other words, that "the two tribunals that tried the accused exert all their powers under and by the authority of the same governmentthat of the United States," Grafton, supra, at 355, and, therefore, that the dual *727 sovereignty doctrine poses no problem. Cf. Heath, supra, at 88. [3] B Both the Government and amici submit that application of the Double Jeopardy Clause in this context carries grave practical consequences. See also post, at 742-743 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Itwould, it is argued, cripple the power to enforce court orders or, alternatively, allow individuals to escape serious punishment for statutory criminal offenses.

42. The subsequent indictment charged Foster with simple assault on November 6, 1987 (Count I); threatening to injure another on or about November 12, 1987, and March 26 and May 17, 1988 (Counts II, III, and IV); and assault with intent to kill on or about May 21, 1988 (Count V). All of the offenses for which Foster was either convicted or acquitted inthe contempt proceeding were similar to, or lesser included offenses of, those charged in the subsequent indictment. Because "the Fifth Amendment forbids successive prosecution . . . for a greater and lesser included offense," Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161 , 169 (1977); see also Grafton, 206 U. S., at 349-351 , the second set of trials should be barred in their entirety. B Professing strict adherence to Blockburger `s so-called "same-elements" test, see Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), Justice Scalia opts for a more circuitous approach. The elements of the crime of contempt, he reasons, in this instance are (1) the existence and knowledge of a court, or CPO; and (2) commission of the underlying substantive offense. See ante, at 701. Where the criminal conduct that forms the basis of the contempt order is identical to that charged in the subsequent trial, Justice Scalia *734 concludes, Blockburger forbids retrial. All elements of Foster's simple assault offense being included in his previous contempt offense, prosecution on that ground is precluded. Ante, at 700.

Keeble v. United States, 412 U. S. 205 *738 (1973), the jury in the second prosecution would in all likelihood receive instructions on the lesser offense and could find Foster guilty of simple assault. In short, while the Government cannot, under the Constitution, bring charges of simple assault, it apparently can, under the majority's interpretation, secure a conviction for simple assault, so long as it prosecutes Foster for assault with intent to kill. As I see it, Foster will have been put in jeopardy twice for simple assault. [10] The result is as unjustifiable as it is pernicious. It *739 stems, I believe, from a "hypertechnical and archaic approach," Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 , 444 (1970). "Archaic" might not quite be the word, for even as far back as 1907 the Court appeared to hold a more pragmatic view. Defendant's court-martial in Grafton was authorized under the 62d Article of War, pursuant to which Congress granted military courts the power to try "officers and soldiers" in time of peace "for any offense, not capital, which the civil law declares to be a crime against the public." 206 U. S., at 341-342, 348, 351 . Grafton faced the following charge: "`In that Private Homer E. Grafton . . . being a sentry on post, did unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously kill Florentino Castro, a Philippino . . . [and] Felix Villanueva, a Philippino.' " Id., at 341. He was acquitted. Id. , at 342. Some three months later, Grafton was prosecuted in a civil criminal court. He was charged with the crime of "assassination," defined as a killing accompanied by any of the following: "(1) With treachery; (2) For price or promise of reward; (3) By means of flood, fire, or poison; (4) With deliberate premeditation; (5) With vindictiveness, by deliberately and inhumanly increasing the suffering of the person attacked." Id. , at 343. Grafton ultimately was found guilty of homicide, a lesser included offense. Id. , at 344. To convict Grafton in the first proceeding, then, it had to be established that (1) he was an officer or a soldier, and (2) he unlawfully killed. In the civil tribunal, the prosecution was required to prove (1) the killing, and (2) some further element, as specified. Had Grafton been tried in 1993 rather than 1907, I suppose that an inflexible Blockburger test, which asks whether "each provision requires proof of a fact the other does not," 284 U. S., at 304, would uncover no double jeopardy problem. At the time, though, the Court looked at matters differently: Both trials being for the same killing, and "[t]he identity of the offenses [being] determined, *740 not by their grade, but by their nature," id. , at 350, prosecuting Grafton for assassination meant twice putting him in jeopardy for the same offense. I would dispose of Foster's case in like fashion, and focus on what Justice Scalia overlooks: The interests safeguarded by the Double Jeopardy Clause, and the fact that Foster should not have to defend himself twice against the same charges.

[14] Both Justice White, post, at 735, and Justice Souter, post, at 758 759, recognize that Gavieres did hold that Blockburger is the only test for "same offence." Justice Souter handles this difficulty by simply ignoring the concession. See ibid. Justice White first minimizes the concession, arguing that application of our version of Blockburger to successive prosecutions has happened (by reason of Gavieres ) "only once." Post, at 735. Once, it seems to us, is enough to make a precedent. Justice White then seeks to neutralize the precedent by offering stillanother case, Grafton v. United States, 206 U. S. 333 (1907), that cannot support the reading grafted onto it today. Post, at 739-740. The defendant in Grafton was first tried and acquitted by a military court for the offense of homicide, and then tried by a civilian criminal court for assassination, and convicted of homicide, based on the same conduct. 206 U. S.,at 349. The second prosecution was held barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Justice White argues that, just as Grafton had to be a soldier for the military court to have jurisdiction, so too here the only relevance of the CPO is that it gave the court authority to punish offenses "already prescribed by the criminal law." Post, at 740. This description does not accurately portray the threat counts, see n. 8, supra but the problem with Justice White's analysis is deeper than that. The substantive offense for which Grafton was first tried (violation of Philippines Penal Code Article 404) did not have as one of its elements status as a soldier, whereas the substantive offense for which Foster was first tried did have as one of its elements knowledge of an extant CPO. See supra, at 700-702. Since military status was not an element of Grafton's charged offense, it is not true that our analysis would produce a result contrary to the opinion in Grafton. Under the traditional Blockburger elements test, assassination, as defined in Article 403 of the Philippines Penal Code, contained an element that homicide, as defined in Article 404, did not; but, as the Court noted, homicide did not contain any element not included in assassination. 206 U. S., at 350 ("One crime may be a constituent part of the other"); accord, id., at 355 (he "could not subsequently be tried for the same offense"). Grafton could therefore not later be prosecuted for assassination, much less later be convicted for the very same homicide offense of which he had been acquitted. (In fact, Grafton may simply have been decided on grounds of collateral estoppel, see id., at 349-351, an issue that we specifically decline to reach in this case, see n. 17, infra. ) [15] It is unclear what definition of "same offence" Justice Souter would have us adopt for successive prosecution. At times, he appears content with our having added to Blockburger the Grady same-conduct test. At other times, however, he adopts an ultra-Grady "same transaction" rule, which would require the Government to try together all offenses (regardless of the differences in the statutes) based on one event. See post, at 747, 761. Of course, the same-transaction test, long espoused by Justice Brennan, see, e. g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161 , 170 (1977) (concurring opinion), has been consistently rejected by the Court. See, e. g., Garrett v. United States, 471 U. S. 773 , 790 (1985).

Indeed, given the contexta "domestic situation"he finds this construction "highly artificial." Ibid. But that, too, is how the court applying the court order appears to have understood it. Responding to the very argument made here by Justice Scalianamely that the "context of domestic violence" somehow stretched the meaning of "threat," Tr. in Nos. IF-630-87, IF 631-87 (Aug. 8, 1988), p. 315the court asserted that "in a criminal case, the defendant is entitled to more specific notice of the nature of the charge." Id. , at 316. Significantly, in acquitting Foster with respect to the threat allegedly made on November 12, 1987, the court stated that it was "not satisfied if those words as such, in spite of the context of this dispute, constitutes a legal threat." Ibid. (emphasis added). For the same reason that the court concluded that the word "assault" referred to the District's criminal provisions, it decided that the CPO's reference to "threats" was to "legal" threats i. e., threats as defined by the law. Moreover, I note that the Government's presentation of this case coincides with this view. See Brief for United States 26 (describing the order not to "assault or in any manner threaten" as "direct[ing] Foster .

I suppose that the judge could upon request instruct the jury on the lesser included offense and await its verdict; if it were to find Foster guilty of simple assault, the court could then vacate the conviction as violative of the Double Jeopardy Clauseor, barring that, Foster could appeal his conviction on that basis. The sheer oddity of this scenario aside, it falls short of providing Foster with the full constitutional protection to which he is entitled. A double jeopardy violation occurs at the inception of trial, which is why an order denying a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable. See Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651 (1977). As we explained in that case: "[T]he Double Jeopardy Clause protects an individual against more than being subjected to double punishments. It is a guarantee against being twice put to trial for the same offense." Id. , at 660-661. In light of the lesser included offense instructions, and the associated risk of conviction for that offense, Foster would have to defend himself in his second trial once more against the charge of simple assault, thereby undergoing the "personal strain, public embarrassment, and expense of a criminal trial." Id. , at 661. Even if the conviction were set aside, he still would have "been forced to endure a trial that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to prohibit." Id. , at 662. Indeed, I would have imagined that Justice Scalia would agree. As he recently wrote: "Since the Double Jeopardy Clause protects the defendant from being `twice put in jeopardy,' i. e., made to stand trial . . .for the `same offence,' it presupposes that sameness can be determined before the second trial. Otherwise, the Clause would have prohibited a second `conviction' or `sentence' for the same offense." Grady, 495 U. S., at 529 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added).
