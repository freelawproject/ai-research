**Lead Opinion**
 In the absence of evidence of overbearing, statements then made in the presence of counsel might be free of the compelling influence of the interrogation process and might fairly be construed as a waiver of the privilege for purposes of these statements.  Although this Court held in Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367 (1951), over strong dissent, that a witness before a grand jury may not in certain circumstances decide to answer <§ome questions and then refuse to answer others, that decision has no application to the interrogation situation we deal with today.  No legislative or judicial fact-finding authority is involved here, nor is there a possibility that the individual might make self-serving statements of which he could make use at trial while refusing to answer incriminating statements.  The distinction and its significance has been aptly described in the opinion of a Scottish court: “In former times such questioning, if undertaken, would be conducted by police officers visiting the house or place of business of the suspect and there questioning him, probably in the presence of a relation or friend.  However convenient the modern practice may be, it must normally create a situation very unfavourable to the suspect.” Chalmers v. H. M. Advocate, [1954] Sess. Cas. 66, 78 (J.C.).  See People v. Dorado, 62 Cal. 2d 338, 354 , 398 P. 2d 361, 371 , 42 Cal. Rptr. 169, 179 (1965).  In accordance with our holdings today and in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 492 , Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958) and Cicenia v. <citedDecision>Lagay, 357 U. S. 504</citedDecision> (1958) are not to be followed.  In quoting the above from the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brandéis we, of course, do not intend to pass on the constitutional questions involved in the Olmstead case. Schaefer, Federalism and State Criminal Procedure, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 1 , 26 (1956).  Miranda, Vignera, and Westover were identified by eyewitnesses.  Marked bills from the bank robbed were found in Westover’s car. Articles stolen from the victim as well as from several other robbery victims were found in Stewart’s home at the outset of the investigation.  Dealing as we do here with constitutional standards in relation to statements made, the existence of independent corroborating evidence produced at trial is, of course, irrelevant to our decisions.  Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 518-519 (1963); Lynumn v. *482 Illinois, 372 U. S. 528, 537-538 (1963); Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 541 (1961); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199, 206 (1960).
