 For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act prohibits." 346 U. S., at 499-500 .  [5] Moreover, San Diego Unions v. Garmon expressly recognized that "the Board may decide that an activity is neither protected nor prohibited, and thereby raise the *145 question whether such activity may be regulated by the States." 359 U. S., at 245 .  [6] It is true, however, that many decisions fleshing out the concept of activities "protected" because Congress meant them to be "unrestricted by any governmental power to regulate," Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 488 , involved review of per se NLRB rules applied in the regulation of the bargaining process.  E. g., NLRB v. American National Ins. Co., 343 U. S. 395 (1952); NLRB v. Insurance Agents, supra ; NLRB v. Drivers Local Union, 362 U. S. 274 (1960); NLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S. 278 (1965); American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300 (1965); cf. NLRB v. Truck Drivers Union, 353 U. S. 87 (1957); H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S. 99 (1970); Florida Power & Light v. Electrical Workers, 417 U. S. 790 , 805 n. 16 (1974).  But the analysis of Garner and Insurance Agents came full bloom in the pre-emption area in Teamsters Union v. Morton, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 252</citedDecision> (1964), which held pre-empted the application *146 of state law to award damages for peaceful union secondary picketing.  Although <citedDecision>Morton</citedDecision> involved conduct neither "protected nor prohibited" by § 7 or § 8 of the NLRA, we recognized the necessity of an inquiry whether " `Congress occupied this field and closed it to state regulation.' " <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 258</citedDecision> .  Central to <citedDecision>Morton</citedDecision> 's analysis was the observation that "[i]n selecting which forms of economic pressure should be prohibited .  .  .  , Congress struck the `balance .  .  .  between the uncontrolled power of management and labor to further their respective interests,' " <citedDecision>id., at 258-259</citedDecision> , [7] and: "This weapon of self-help, permitted by federal law, formed an integral part of the petitioner's effort to achieve its bargaining goals during negotiations with the respondent.  Allowing its use is a part of the balance struck by Congress between the conflicting interests of the union, the employees, the employer and the community.  .  .  .  If the Ohio law of secondary boycott can be applied to proscribe the same type of conduct which Congress focused upon but did not proscribe when it enacted § 303, the inevitable result would be to frustrate the congressional determination to leave this weapon of self-help available, and to upset the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy.  `For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act *147 prohibits.'

 Cox, supra, n. 4, at 1365.  See, e. g., Beasley v. Food Fair of North Carolina, 416 U. S. 653 (1974).  Whether self-help economic activities are employed by employer or union, the crucial inquiry regarding pre-emption is the same: whether "the exercise *148 of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act's processes." Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S., at 380 .  III There is simply no question that the Act's processes would be frustrated in the instant case were the State's ruling permitted to stand.  The employer in this case invoked the Wisconsin law because it was unable to overcome the Union tactic with its own economic self-help means.  [9] Although it did employ economic weapons putting pressure on the Union when it terminated the previous *149 agreement, supra, at 134, it apparently lacked sufficient economic strength to secure its bargaining demands under "the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy," Teamsters Union v. Morton, <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 260</citedDecision> .  [10] But the economic weakness of the affected party cannot justify state aid contrary to federal law for, as we have developed, "the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is not a grudging exception [under] .  .  .  the [federal] Act; it is part and parcel of the process of collective bargaining." Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 495 .  The state action in this case is not filling "a regulatory void which Congress plainly assumed would not exist," Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S., at 196 (BRENNAN, J., concurring).

 .  strike tactics" and left such "regulation .  .  .  to the states." 67 Wis. 2d, at 22 , 226 N. W. 2d, at 207 .  Finally, the court rejected the Union's argument relying on Teamsters Union v. <citedDecision>Morton</citedDecision> that the refusal to work overtime was affirmatively "permitted" under federal law, stating: "Congress has not `focused upon' partial .  .  .  strikes," and therefore "[p]olicing of such conduct is left wholly to the states." 67 Wis. 2d, at 26 , 226 N. W. 2d, at 209 .  Since Briggs-Stratton is today overruled, and as we hold further that the Union's refusal to work overtime is peaceful conduct constituting activity which must be free of regulation by the States if the congressional intent in enacting the comprehensive federal law of labor relations is not to be frustrated, the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is Reversed.  MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.

 With this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court. MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, dissenting.  If the partial strike activity in this case were protected, or even arguably protected, by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, the Court's conclusion would be supported by San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 .  But in Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 336 U. S. 245 ( Briggs-Stratton ), the Court rejected the argument that comparable activity was protected by § 7.  And as I understand the Court's holding today, it assumes *157 that this activity remains unprotected.  [1] Moreover, if such activity were prohibited, or arguably prohibited, by § 8 of the Act, the Court's conclusion would also be supported by Garmon .  But ever since NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , it has been clear that this activity is not even arguably prohibited.  If Congress had focused on the problems presented by partial strike activity, and had enacted special legislation dealing with this subject matter, but left the form of the activity disclosed by this record unregulated, the Court's conclusion would be supported by Teamsters Union v. Morton, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 252</citedDecision> .  But this is not such a case. Despite the numerous statements in the Court's opinion about Congress' intent to leave partial strike activity wholly unregulated, I have found no legislative expression of any such intent nor any evidence that Congress has scrutinized such activity.  [2] *158 If this Court had previously held that the no-man's land in which conduct is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited by federal law is nevertheless pre-empted by an unexpressed legislative intent, I would follow such a holding.  But none of the cases reviewed in the Court's opinion so holds.  [3] Ever since 1949, when Briggs-Stratton was decided, the rule has been that partial strike activity within that area may be regulated by the States.  If adherence to the rule of Briggs-Stratton would permit *159 the States substantially to disrupt the balance Congress has struck between union and employer, I would readily join in overruling it.  But I am not persuaded that partial strike activity is so essential to the bargaining process that the States should not be free to make it illegal.
