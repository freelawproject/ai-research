 ... In such cases where the Federal court acts in aid of its own jurisdiction and to render its decree effectual, it may, notwithstanding sec. 720, Rev. Stat., [§ 265 J. C.] restrain all proceedings in a state court which would have the effect of defeating or impairing its jurisdiction.  ... It is conceded that the Federal right could be set up in the state court from which the execution issued, and, if denied, the ultimate rights of the parties can be determined upon writ of error to this court. In the view we have taken of this case the Federal court had not lost its jurisdiction to protect the purchaser at its sale upon direct proceedings such as are now before us.” 14 *148 Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U. S. 189 , followed the established doctrine.  The Riverdale Mills acquired property by judicial sale in the federal court. A state proceeding later was begun by parties to the federal foreclosure alleging the invalidity of the sale and seeking possession of the property.  Riverdale then filed an ancillary bill in the original foreclosure suit for an injunction against prosecution of the state suit.  Against the claimed protection of R. S. § 720 (§ 265 J. C.), p. 193, it was held here that a federal court may “protect the title which it has decreed as against every one a party to the original suit and prevent that party from relitigating the questions of right which have already been determined.” P. 195.  It is quite clear that the Court in both the Julian and the Riverdale cases was intent not on protecting a res, since that had long passed from its hands, but on avoiding relitigation by executing its decrees.  This appears particularly from their reliance upon French v. Hay, <citedDecision>22 Wall. 250</citedDecision> ; Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U. S. 494 ; and Sharon v. Terry, 36 F. 337 .  In the <citedDecision>French</citedDecision> case no res was involved.  It was a federal injunction against the enforcement of a judgment of a state court obtained in a state action after removal of a related but separate state suit.  The reasoning proceeded upon the protection of federal judgments, not on the language of the removal statute.  The same is true of Dietzsch .  There a state suit on a replevin bond was enjoined by the federal court because it grew out of a failure to return property awarded in replevin in a state court after the removal of the original replevin suit to the federal court which issued the injunction.  It was there said, p. 497: “A court of the United States is not prevented from enforcing its own judgments by the statute which forbids it to grant a writ of injunction to stay proceedings in a State court.” *149 The Court today lays aside Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273 (1906), as inapplicable.  The case in our view may be properly cited as a relitigation decision.
