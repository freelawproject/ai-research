 Also rejected was the Government’s suggestion that the Court modify the privilege by vesting it in the witness-spouse, with freedom to testify or not independent of the defendant’s control.  The Court viewed this proposed modification as antithetical to the widespread belief, evidenced in the rules then in effect in a majority of the States and in England, “that the law should not force or encourage testimony which might alienate husband and wife, or further inflame existing domestic differences.” Id., at 79 .  Hawkins , then, left the federal privilege for adverse spousal testimony where it found it, continuing “a rule which bars the testimony of one spouse against the other unless both consent.” Id., at 78 .  Accord, Wyatt v. United States, 362 U. S. 525, 528 (1960).  7 However, in so doing, the Court made clear that its decision was not meant to “foreclose whatever changes in the rule may eventually be dictated by ‘reason and experience.’ ” 358 U. S., at 79 .  *47 III A The Federal Rules of Evidence acknowledge the authority of the federal courts to continue the evolutionary development of testimonial privileges in federal criminal trials “governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted ... in the light of reason and experience.” Fed. Rule Evid. 501.  Cf. Wolfle v. United States, <citedDecision>291 U. S. 7, 12</citedDecision> (1934).  The general mandate of Rule 501 was substituted by the Congress for a set of privilege rules drafted by the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence and approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States and by this Court. That proposal defined nine specific privileges, including a husband-wife privilege which would have codified the Hawkins rule and eliminated the privilege for confidential marital communications.  See proposed Fed. Rule Evid. 505.  In rejecting the proposed Rules and enacting Rule 501, Congress manifested an affirmative intention not to freeze the law of privilege.  Its purpose rather was to “provide the courts with the flexibility to develop rules of privilege on a case-by-case basis,” 120 Cong. Rec. 40891 (1974) (statement of Rep. Hungate), and to leave the door open to change.  See also S. Rep. No. 93-1277, p. 11 (1974); H. R. Rep. No. 93-650, p. 8 (1973).  8 Although Rule 501 confirms the authority of the federal courts to reconsider the continued validity of the Hawkins *48 rule, the long history of the privilege suggests that it ought not to be casually cast aside.

 In response to the question whether divorce was contemplated, Mrs. Trammel testified that her husband had said that “I would go my way and he would go his.” App. 27.  The Government represents to the Court that Elizabeth Trammel has not been prosecuted for her role in the conspiracy.  Roberts and Freeman were also convicted.  Roberts was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.  Freeman received an indeterminate sentence under the Youth Corrections Act.  See Brosman, Edward Livingston and Spousal Testimony in Louisiana, 11 Tulane L. Rev. 243 (1937); Hutchins & Slesinger, Some Observations *45 on the Law of Evidence: Family Relations, 13 Minn. L.

This Court recognized just such a confidential marital communications privilege in Wolfle v. United States, <citedDecision>291 U. S. 7</citedDecision> (1934), and in Blau v. United States, 340 U. S. 332 (1951).  In neither case, however, did the Court adopt the Wigmore view that the communications privilege be substituted in place of the privilege against adverse spousal testimony.  The privilege as to confidential marital communications is not at issue in the instant case; accordingly, our holding today does not disturb Wolfie and Blau .  See Note, Competency of One Spouse to Testify Against the Other in *46 Criminal Cases Where the Testimony Does Not Relate to Confidential Communications: Modern Trend, 38 Va. L. Rev. 359 (1952).  The decision in Wyatt recognized an exception to Hawkins for cases in which one spouse commits a crime against the other.  362 U. S., at 526 .  This exception, placed on the ground of necessity, was a longstanding one at common law. See Lord Audley’s Case, 123 Eng. Rep. 1140 (1631); 8 Wigmore §2239.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring in the judgment. Although agreeing with much of what the Court has to say, I cannot join an opinion that implies that “reason and experience” have worked a vast change since the Hawkins case was decided in 1958. In that case the Court upheld the privilege of a defendant in a criminal case to prevent adverse spousal testimony, in an all-but-unanimous opinion by Mr. Justice Black. Today the Court, in another all-but-unanimous opinion, obliterates that privilege because of the pur- *54 ported change in perception that “reason and experience” have'wrought. The fact of the matter is that the Court in this case simply accepts the very same arguments that the Court rejected when the Government first made them in the Hawkins case in 1958. I thought those arguments were valid then, 1 and I think so now. The Court is correct when it says that “[t]he ancient foundations for so sweeping a privilege have long since disappeared.” Ante, at 52. But those foundations had disappeared well before 1958; their disappearance certainly did not occur in the few years that have elapsed between the Hawkins decision and this one. To paraphrase what Mr. Justice Jackson once said in another context, there is reason to believe that today’s opinion of the Court will be of greater interest to students of human psychology than to students of law. 2 “The rule of evidence we are here asked to re-examine has been called a ‘sentimental relic.’ It was bom of two concepts long since rejected: that a criminal defendant was incompetent to testify in his own case, and that in law husband and wife were one. What thus began as a disqualification of either spouse from testifying at all yielded gradually to the policy of admitting all relevant evidence, until it has now become simply a privilege of the criminal defendant to prevent his spouse from testifying against him. “Any rule that impedes the discovery of truth in a court of law impedes as well the doing of justice. When such a rule is the product of a con-ceptualism long ago discarded, is universally criticized by scholars, and has been qualified or abandoned in many jurisdictions, it should receive the most careful scrutiny. Surely ‘reason and experience’ require that we do more than indulge in mere assumptions, perhaps naive assumptions, as to the importance of this ancient rule to the interests of domestic tranquillity.” Hawkins v. United States, 358 U. S. 74, 81-82 (concurring opinion) (citations and footnotes omitted). See Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 325 (dissenting opinion).

Similar exceptions have been found to the confidential marital communications privilege.
