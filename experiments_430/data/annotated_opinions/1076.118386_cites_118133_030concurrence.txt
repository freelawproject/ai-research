**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice O’Connor, with whom Justice Breyer joins, concurring in the judgment.  In 1965, Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 79 Stat. 27 (1965 Act).  Under Title I, Congress provided monetary grants to States to address the needs of educationally deprived children of low-income families.  Under Title II, Congress provided further monetary *837 grants to States for the acquisition of library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials for use by children and teachers in public and private elementary and secondary schools.  Since 1965, Congress has reauthorized the Title I and Title II programs several times.  Three Terms ago, we held in Agostini v. Felton, <citedDecision>521 U. S. 203</citedDecision> (1997), that Title I, as applied in New York City, did not violate the Establishment Clause.  I believe that <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> likewise controls the constitutional inquiry respecting Title II presented here, and requires the reversal of the Court of Appeals’ judgment that the program is unconstitutional as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.  To the extent our decisions in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229 (1977), are inconsistent with the Court’s judgment today, I agree that those decisions should be overruled.  I therefore concur in the judgment.  I — I I write separately because, in my view, the plurality announces a rule of unprecedented breadth for the evaluation of Establishment Clause challenges to government school aid programs.  Reduced to its essentials, the plurality's rule states that government aid to religious schools does not have the effect of advancing religion so long as the aid is offered on a neutral basis and the aid is secular in content.  The plurality also rejects the distinction between direct and indirect aid, and holds that the actual diversion of secular aid by a religious school to the advancement of its religious mission is permissible.  Although the expansive scope of the plurality's rule is troubling, two specific aspects of the opinion compel me to write separately.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 I agree with Justice Souter that the plurality, by taking such a stance, “appears to take evenhandedness neutrality and in practical terms promote it to a single and sufficient test for the establishment constitutionality of school aid.” Post, at 900 (dissenting opinion).  I do not quarrel with the plurality’s recognition that neutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs against Establishment Clause challenges.  Our cases have described neutrality in precisely this mannei’, and we have emphasized a program’s neutrality repeatedly in our decisions approving various forms of school aid.  See, <citedDecision>e.  g., Agostini, supra, at 228, 231-282</citedDecision> ; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 10 (1993); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487-488 (1986); id., at 493 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring *839 in judgment); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397-399 (1983).  Nevertheless, we have never held that a government-aid program passes constitutional muster solely because of the neutral criteria it employs as a basis for distributing aid.  For example, in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , neutrality was only one of several factors we considered in determining that New York City’s Title I program did not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  See <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 226-228</citedDecision> (noting lack of evidence of inculcation of religion by Title I instructors, legal requirement that Title I services be supplemental to regular curricula, and that no Title I funds reached religious schools’ coffers).  Indeed, given that the aid in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> had secular content and was distributed on the basis of wholly neutral criteria, our consideration of additional factors demonstrates that the plurality’s rule does not accurately describe our recent Establishment Clause jurisprudence.  See also Zobrest, swpra, at 10,12-13 (noting that no government funds reached religious school’s coffers, aid did not relieve school of expense it otherwise would have assumed, and aid was not distributed to school but to the child).  Justice Souter provides a comprehensive review of our Establishment Clause cases on government aid to religious institutions that is useful for its explanation of the various ways in which we have used the term “neutrality” in our decisions.  See post, at 878-883.  Even if we at one time used the term “neutrality” in a descriptive sense to refer to those aid programs characterized by the requisite equipoise between support of religion and antagonism to religion, Justice Souter’s discussion convincingly demonstrates that the evolution in the meaning of the term in our jurisprudence is cause to hesitate before equating the neutrality of recent decisions with the neutrality of old.  As I have previously explained, neutrality is important, but it is by no means the only “axiom in the history and precedent of the Establishment Clause.” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 846 (1995) (concurring opinion).  Thus, *840 I agree with Justice Souter’s conclusion that our “most recent use of ‘neutrality 5 to refer to generality or evenhand-edness of distribution ... is relevant in judging whether a benefit scheme so characterized should be seen as aiding a sectarian school’s religious mission, but this neutrality is not alone sufficient to qualify the aid as constitutional.” Post, at 883-884.  I also disagree with the plurality’s conclusion that actual diversion of government aid to religious indoctrination is consistent with the Establishment Clause.  See ante, at 820-825.  Although “[o]ur eases have permitted some government funding of secular functions performed by sectarian organizations,” our decisions “provide no precedent for the use of public funds to finance religious activities.” Rosenberger, supra, at 847 (O’Connor, J., concurring).  At least two of the decisions at the heart of today’s case demonstrate that we have long been concerned that secular government aid not be diverted to the advancement of religion.  In both <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , our most recent school aid case, and Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968), we rested our approval of the relevant programs in part on the fact that the aid had not been used to advance the religious missions of the recipient schools.  See <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 226-227</citedDecision> (“[N]o evidence has ever shown that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students”); Allen, supra, at 248 (“Nothing in this record supports the proposition that all textbooks, whether they deal with mathematics, physics, foreign languages, history, or literature, are used by the parochial schools to teach religion”).  Of course, our focus on the lack of such evidence would have been entirely unnecessary if we had believed that the Establishment Clause permits the actual diversion of secular government aid to religious indoctrination.  Our decision in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589 (1988), also demonstrates that actual diversion is constitutionally impermissible.  After eonclud- *841 ing that the government-aid program in question was constitutional on its face, we remanded the case so that the District Court could determine, after further factual development, whether aid recipients had used the government aid to support their religious objectives.  See id., at 621-622 ; id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“[T]he only purpose of further inquiring whether any particular grantee institution is pervasively sectarian is as a preliminary step to demonstrating that the funds are in fact being used to further religion”).  The remand would have been unnecessary if, as the plurality contends, actual diversion were irrelevant under the Establishment Clause.  The plurality bases its holding that actual diversion is permissible on Witters and Zobrest.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 See ante, at 880-831.  Like Justice Souter, I do not believe that we should treat a per-eapita-aid program the same as the true private-choice programs considered in Witters and Zobrest .  See post, at 902.  First, when the government provides aid directly to the student beneficiary, that student can attend a religious school and yet retain control over whether the secular government aid will be applied toward the religious education.  The fact that aid flows to the religious school and is used for the advancement of religion is therefore wholly dependent on the student’s private decision.  See Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 848 (O’Con-nor, J., concurring) (discussing importance of private choice in Witters)', Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 (“[T]he fact that aid goes to individuals means that the decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not by the State”); id., at 493 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“The aid to religion at issue here is the result of petitioner’s private choice”).  It is for this reason that in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> we relied on Witters and.  Zobrest to reject the rule “that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid,” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 225</citedDecision> , yet also rested our approval of New York City’s Title I program in part on the lack of evidence of actual diversion, <citedDecision>id., at 226-227</citedDecision> .  Second, I believe the distinction between a per capita school aid program and a true private-choice program is significant for purposes of endorsement.  See, e. g., Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 692 (1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring).  In terms of public perception, a government program of direct aid to religious schools based on the number of students attending each school differs meaningfully from the government distributing aid directly to individual students *843 who, in turn, decide to use the aid at the same religious schools.  In the former example, if the religious school uses the aid to inculcate religion in its students, it is reasonable to say that the government has communicated a message of endorsement.  Because the religious indoctrination is supported by government assistance, the reasonable observer would naturally perceive the aid program as government support for the advancement of religion.  That the amount of aid received by the school is based on the school’s enrollment does not separate the government from the endorsement of the religious message.

 See ante, at 818-820.  That omission, however, is of little comfort.  In its logic — as well as its specific advisory language, see ante, at 819-820, n. 8 — the plurality opinion foreshadows the approval of direct monetary subsidies to religious organizations, even when they use the money to advance their religious objectives.  Our school aid cases often pose difficult questions at the intersection of the neutrality and no-aid principles and therefore defy simple categorization under either rule.  As I explained in Rosenberger , “[rjesolution instead depends on the hard task of judging — sifting through the details and determining whether the challenged program offends the Establishment Clause.  Such judgment requires courts to draw lines, sometimes quite fine, based on the particular facts of each ease.” 515 U. S., at 847 (concurring opinion).  <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> represents our most recent attempt to devise a general framework for approaching questions concerning neutral school aid programs.  <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> also concerned an Establishment Clause challenge to a school aid program closely related to the one at issue here.  For these reasons, as well as my disagreement with the plurality’s approach, I would decide today’s case by applying the criteria set forth in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> .  II In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , after reexamining our jurisprudence since School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985), we explained that the general principles used to determine whether government aid violates the Establishment Clause have remained largely unchanged.  <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 222</citedDecision> .  Thus, *845 we still ask “whether the government acted with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting religion” and “whether the aid has the ‘effect’ of advancing or inhibiting religion.” <citedDecision>Id., at 222-223</citedDecision> .  We also concluded in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , however, that the specific criteria used to determine whether government aid has an impermissible effect had changed.  <citedDecision>Id., at 223</citedDecision> .  Looking to our recently decided cases, we articulated three primary criteria to guide the determination whether a government-aid program impermissibly advances religion: (1) whether the aid results in governmental indoctrination, (2) whether the aid program defines its recipients by reference to religion, and (3) whether the aid creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion.  <citedDecision>Id., at 234</citedDecision> .  Finally, we noted that the same criteria could be reviewed to determine whether a government-aid program constitutes an endorsement of religion.  <citedDecision>Id., at 235</citedDecision> .  Respondents neither question the secular purpose of the Chapter 2 (Title II) program nor contend that it creates an excessive entanglement.  (Due to its denomination as Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981, 95 Stat. 469 , the parties refer to the 1965 Act’s Title II program, as modified by subsequent legislation, as “Chapter 2.” For ease of reference, I will do the same.) Accordingly, for purposes of deciding whether Chapter 2, as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, violates the Establishment Clause, we need ask only whether the program results in governmental indoctrination or defines its recipients by reference to religion.  Taking the second inquiry first, it is clear that Chapter 2 does not define aid recipients by reference to religion.  In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , we explained that scrutiny of the manner in which a government-aid program identifies its recipients is important because “the criteria might themselves have the effect of advancing religion by creating a financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 231</citedDecision> .  We then clarified that this financial incentive is not present *846 “where the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and seeular beneficiaries on a nondiseriminatory basis.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Under Chapter 2, the Secretary of Education allocates funds to the States based on each State’s share of the Nation’s school-age population.  20 U. S. C. § 7811 (b).  The state educational agency (SEA) of each recipient State, in turn, must distribute the State’s Chapter 2 funds to local educational agencies (LEA’s) “according to the relative enrollments in public and private, nonprofit schools within the school districts of such agencies,” adjusted to take into account those LEA’s “which have the greatest numbers or percentages of children whose education imposes a higher than average cost per child.” § 7312(a).  The LEA must then expend those funds on “innovative assistance programs” designed to improve student achievement.  § 7351(b).  The statute generally requires that an LEA ensure the “equitable participation” of children enrolled in private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools, § 7372(a)(1), and specifically mandates that all LEA expenditures on behalf of children enrolled in private schools “be equal (consistent with the number of children to be served) to expenditures for programs ... for children enrolled in the public schools of the [LEA],” § 7372(b).  As these statutory provisions make clear, Chapter 2 uses wholly neutral and secular criteria to allocate aid to students enrolled in religious and secular schools alike.  As a result, it creates no financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination.  <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> next requires us to ask whether Chapter 2 “result[s] in governmental indoctrination.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 234</citedDecision> .  Because this is a more complex inquiry under our case law, it is useful first to review briefly the basis for our decision in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> that New York City’s Title I program did not result in governmental indoctrination.  Under that program, public-school teachers provided Title I instruction to eligible *847 students on private school premises during regular school hours.  Twelve years earlier, in Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), we had held the same New York City program unconstitutional.  In Ball , a companion case to Aguilar , we also held that a similar program in Grand Rapids, Michigan, violated the Constitution.  Our decisions in Aguilar and Ball were both based on a presumption, drawn in large part from Meek , see 421 U. S., at 367-373 , that public-school instructors who teach secular classes on the campuses of religious schools will inevitably inculcate religion in their students.  In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , we recognized that “[o]ur more recent eases [had] undermined the assumptions upon which Ball and Aguilar relied.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 222</citedDecision> .  First, we explained that the Court had since abandoned “the presumption erected in Meek and Ball that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion.” Id., at 223.  Rather, relying on Zobrest , we explained that in the absence of evidence showing that teachers were actually using the Title I aid to inculcate religion, we would presume that the instructors would comply with the program’s secular restrictions.  See Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-227</citedDecision> .  The Title I services were required by statute to be “ 'secular, neutral, and nonideological.’ ” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 210 (quoting 20U.S.C.  § 6321(a)(2)).  Second, we noted that the Court had “departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.” <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 225</citedDecision> .  Relying on Witters and Zobrest , we noted that our cases had taken a more forgiving view of neutral government programs that make aid available generally without regard to the religious or nonreligious character of the recipient school.  See Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 225-226</citedDecision> .  With respect to the specific Title I pro *848 gram at issue, we noted several factors that precluded us from finding an impermissible financing of religious indoctrination: the aid was “provided to students at whatever school they choose to attend,” the services were “by law supplemental to the regular curricula” of the benefited schools, “[n]o Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools,” and there was no evidence of Title I instructors having “attempted to inculcate religion in students.” <citedDecision>Id., at 226-228</citedDecision> .  Relying on the same factors, we also concluded that the New York City program could not “reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.” <citedDecision>Id., at 235</citedDecision> .  Although we found it relevant that Title I services could not be provided on a sehoolwide basis, we also explained that this fact was likely a sufficient rather than a necessary condition of the program’s constitutionality.  We were not “willing to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid.” <citedDecision>Id., at 229</citedDecision> .  The Chapter 2 program at issue here bears the same hallmarks of the New York City Title I program that we found important in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> .  First, as explained above, Chapter 2 aid is distributed on the basis of neutral, secular criteria.  The aid is available to assist students regardless of whether they attend public or private nonprofit religious schools.  Second, the statute requires participating SEA’s and LEA’s to use and allocate Chapter 2 funds only to supplement the funds otherwise available to a religious school.  20 U. S. C. § 7371 (b).  Chapter 2 funds must in no ease be used to supplant funds from non-Federal sources.  Ibid. Third, no Chapter 2 funds ever reach the coffers of a religious school.  Like the Title I program considered in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , all Chapter 2 funds are controlled by public agencies — the SEA’s and LEA’s.  § 7372(c)(1).  The LEA’s purchase instructional and educational materials and then lend those materials to public and private schools.  See §§ 7351(a), (b)(2).  With respect to lending to private schools under Chapter 2, the statute *849 specifically provides that the relevant public agency must retain title to the materials and equipment.  § 7372(c)(1).  Together with the supplantation restriction, this provision ensures that religious schools reap no financial benefit by virtue of receiving loans of materials and equipment.  Finally, the statute provides that all Chapter 2 materials and equipment must be “secular, neutral, and nonideological.” § 7372(a)(1).  That restriction is reinforced by a further statutory prohibition on “the making of any payment... for religious worship or instruction.” §8897.  Although respondents claim that Chapter 2 aid has been diverted to religious instruction, that evidence is de minimis, as I explain at greater length below.  See infra, at 864-867.  Respondents contend that <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> is distinguishable, pointing to the distinct character of the aid program considered there.  See Brief for Respondents 44-47.  In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , federal funds paid for public-school teachers to provide secular instruction to eligible children on the premises of their religious schools.  Here, in contrast, federal funds pay for instructional materials and equipment that LEA’s lend to religious schools for use by those schools’ own teachers in their classes.  Because we held similar programs unconstitutional in Meek and Wolman , respondents contend that those decisions, and not <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , are controlling.  See, e. g., Brief for Respondents 11,22-25.  Like respondents, Justice Souter also relies on Meek and Wolman in finding the character of the Chapter 2 aid constitutionally problematic.  See post, at 893, 903.  At the time they were decided, Meek and Wolman created an inexplicable rift within our Establishment Clause jurisprudence concerning government aid to schools.  Seven years before our decision in Meek , we held in Allen that a New York statute that authorized the lending of textbooks to students attending religious schools did not violate the *850 Establishment Clause.  392 U. S., at 238 .
**Concurrence Opinion**
 Finally, our decision in Bowen proves only that actual diversion, as opposed to mere divertibility, is constitutionally impermissible.  See, e. g., 487 U. S., at 621 .  Had we believed that the divertibility of secular aid was sufficient to call the aid program into question, there would have been no need for the remand we ordered and no basis for the reversal.  IV Because divertibility fails to explain the distinction our cases have drawn between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment, there remains the question of which of the two irreconcilable strands of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence we should now follow.  Between the two, I would adhere to the rule that we have applied in the context of textbook lending programs: To establish a First Amendment violation, plaintiffs must prove that the aid in question actually is, or has been, used for religious purposes.  See Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362 ; Allen, 392 U. S., at 248 .  Just as we held in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> that our more recent cases had undermined the assumptions underlying Ball and Aguilar , I would now hold that <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> and the eases on which it relied have undermined the assumptions underlying Meek and Wolman .  To be sure, <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> only addressed the specific presumption that public-school employees teaching on the premises of religious schools would inevitably inculcate religion.  Nevertheless, I believe that our definitive rejection of that presumption also stood for — or at least strongly *858 pointed to — the broader proposition that such presumptions of religious indoctrination are normally inappropriate when evaluating neutral school aid programs under the Establishment Clause.  In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , we repeatedly emphasized that it would be inappropriate to presume inculcation of religion; rather, plaintiffs raising an Establishment Clause challenge must present evidence that the government aid in question has resulted in religious indoctrination.  See <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-227</citedDecision> .  We specifically relied on our statement in Zobrest that a presumption of indoctrination, because it constitutes an absolute bar to the aid in question regardless of the religious school’s ability to separate that aid from its religious mission, constitutes a "flat rule, smacking of antiquated notions of ‘taint,’ [that] would indeed exalt form over substance.” 509 U. S., at 13 .  That reasoning applies with equal force to the presumption in Meek and Ball concerning instructional materials and equipment.  As we explained in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , "we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 225</citedDecision> .  Respondents contend that <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> should be limited to its facts, and point specifically to the following statement from my separate opinion in Ball as the basis for retaining a presumption of religious inculcation for instructional materials and equipment: “When full-time parochial school teachers receive public funds to teach secular courses to their parochial school students under parochial school supervision, I agree that the program has the perceived and actual effect of advancing the religious aims of the church-related schools.  This is particularly the case where, as here, religion pervades the curriculum and the teachers are accustomed to bring religion to play in everything they teach.” 473 U. S., at 399-400 (concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  *859 Respondents note that in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> we did not overrule that portion of Ball holding the Community Education program unconstitutional.  Under that program, the government paid religious school teachers to operate as part-time public teachers at their religious schools by teaching secular classes at the conclusion of the regular sehoolday.  Ball, 478 U. S., at 376-377.  Relying on both the majority opinion and my separate opinion in Ball , respondents therefore contend that we must presume that religious school teachers will inculcate religion in their students.  If that is so, they argue, we must also presume that religious school teachers will be unable to follow secular restrictions on the use of instructional materials and equipment lent to their schools by the government.  See Brief for Respondents 26-29.  I disagree, however, that the latter proposition follows from the former.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 Relying on the evidence underlying all but the last of the above claims, Justice Souter concludes that the Chapter 2 program, as applied in Jefferson Parish, violated the Establishment Clause.  See post, at 902-910.  I disagree with both the plurality and Justice Souter.  The limited evidence amassed by respondents during 4 years of discovery (which began approximately 15 years ago) is at best de minimis and therefore insufficient to affect the constitutional inquiry.  The plurality and Justice Souter direct the primary thrust of their arguments at the alleged inadequacy of the program’s safeguards.  Respondents, the plurality, and Justice Souter all appear to proceed from the premise that, so long as actual diversion presents a constitutional problem, the government must have a failsafe mechanism capable of detecting any instance of diversion.  We rejected that very assumption, however, in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> .  There, we explained that because we had “abandoned the assumption that properly instructed public employees will fail to discharge their duties faithfully, we must also discard the assumption that pervasive monitoring of Title I teachers is required.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 234</citedDecision> (emphasis in original).  Because I believe that the Court should abandon the presumption adopted in Meek and Wolman respecting the use of instructional materials and equipment by religious school teachers, I see no constitutional need for pervasive monitoring under the Chapter 2 program.  The safeguards employed by the program are constitutionally sufficient.  At the federal level, the statute limits aid to “secular, neutral, and nonideological services, materials, and equipment,” 20 U. S. C. § 7372 (a)(1); requires that the aid only supplement and not supplant funds from non-Federal sources, § 7371(b); and prohibits “any payment... for religious worship or instruction,” § 8897.  At the state level, the Louisiana Department of Education (the relevant SEA for *862 Louisiana) requires all nonpublie schools to submit signed assurances that they will use Chapter 2 aid only to supplement and not to supplant non-Federal funds, and that the instructional materials and equipment “will only be used for secular, neutral and nonideological purposes.” App. 260a-261a; see also id., at 120a.  Although there is some dispute concerning the mandatory nature of these assurances, Dan Lewis, the director of Louisiana’s Chapter 2 program, testified that all of the State’s nonpublic schools had thus far been willing to sign the assurances, and that the State retained the power to cut off aid to any school that breached an assurance.  Id., at 122a-123a.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 See ante, at 835.  *867 Respondents’ last evidentiary challenge concerns the effectiveness of Chapter 2’s supplantation restriction in Jefferson Parish.  Although Justice Souter does not rest his decision on this point, he does “not[e] the likelihood that unconstitutional supplantation occurred as well.” Post, at 910, n. 28.  I disagree.  The evidence cited by respondents and Justice Souter is too ambiguous to rest any sound conclusions on and, at best, shows some scattered violations of the statutory supplantation restriction that are too insignificant in aggregate to affect the constitutional inquiry.  Indeed, even Justice Souter concedes in this respect that “[t]he record is sparse.” Post, at 911, n. 28.  H» «i* H* Given the important similarities between the Chapter 2 program here and the Title I program at issue in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , respondents’ Establishment Clause challenge must fail.  As in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , the Chapter 2 aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria; the aid must be supplementary and cannot supplant non-Federal funds; no Chapter 2 funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools; the aid must be secular; any evidence of actual diversion is de minimis; and the program includes adequate safeguards.  Regardless of whether these factors are constitutional requirements, they are surely sufficient to find that the program at issue here does not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  For the same reasons, “this carefully constrained program also cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.” Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 235</citedDecision> .  Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.  Indeed, two of the dissenters in Allen agreed with the majority on this method of analysis, asking whether the books at issue were similar enough to fire and police protection.  See 392 U. S., at 252 (Black, J., dissenting); id., at 272 (Fortas, J., dissenting).
