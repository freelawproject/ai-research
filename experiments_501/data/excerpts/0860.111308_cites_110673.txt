 One month after SAMTA brought suit, the Department of Labor formally amended its FLSA interpretive regulations to provide that publicly owned local mass-transit systems are not entitled to immunity under *535 National League of Cities .  44 Fed. Reg. 75630 (1979), codified as 29 CFR § 775.3 (b)(3) (1984).  On November 17, 1981, the District Court granted SAMTA’s motion for summary judgment and denied the Secretary’s and Garcia’s cross-motion for partial summary judgment.  Without further explanation, the District Court ruled that “local public mass transit systems (including [SAMTA]) constitute integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions” under National League of Cities .  App. D to Juris. Statement in No. 82-1913, p. 24a.  The Secretary and Garcia both appealed directly to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1252 .  During the pendency of those appeals, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., <citedDecision>455 U. S. 678</citedDecision> (1982), was decided.  In that case, the Court ruled that commuter rail service provided by the state-owned Long Island Rail Road did not constitute a “traditional governmental function” and hence did not enjoy constitutional immunity, under National League of Cities , from the requirements of the Railway Labor Act.  Thereafter, it vacated the District Court’s judgment in the present cases and remanded them for further consideration in the light of Long Island.  457 U. S. 1102 (1982).  On remand, the District Court adhered to its original view and again entered judgment for SAMTA.  557 F. Supp. 445 (1983).  The court looked first to what it regarded as the “historical reality” of state involvement in mass transit.

 At the same time, courts have held that issuance of industrial development bonds, Woods v. Homes and Structures of Pittsburg, Kansas, Inc., 489 F. Supp. 1270, 1296-1297 (Kan. 1980); regulation of intrastate natural gas sales, Oklahoma ex rel. Derryberry v. FERC, 494 F. Supp. 636, 657 (WD Okla. 1980), aff’d, 661 F. 2d 832 (CA10 1981), cert. denied sub nom. Texas v. FERC, 457 U. S. 1105 (1982); regulation of traffic on public roads, Friends of the Earth v. Carey, 552 F. 2d 25, 38 (CA2), cert. denied, 434 U. S. 902 (1977); regulation of air transportation, Hughes Air Corp. v. Public Utilities Comm’n of Cal., 644 F. 2d 1334 , 1340-1341 (CA9 1981); operation of a telephone system, Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v. FCC, 553 F. 2d 694, 700-701 (CA1 1977); leasing and sale of natural gas, Public Service Co. of N. C. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 716 , 721 (CA5), cert. denied sub nom. Louisiana v. FERC, 444 U. S. 879 (1979); operation of a mental health facility, Williams v. Eastside Mental *539 Health Center, Inc., 669 F. 2d 671, 680-681 (CA11), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 976 (1982); and provision of in-house domestic services for the aged and handicapped, Bonnette v. California Health and Welfare Agency, 704 F. 2d 1465 , 1472 (CA9 1983), are not entitled to immunity.  We find it difficult, if not impossible, to identify an organizing principle that places each of the cases in the first group on one side of a line and each of the cases in the second group on the other side.  The constitutional distinction between licensing drivers and regulating traffic, for example, or between operating a highway authority and operating a mental health facility, is elusive at best.  Thus far, this Court itself has made little headway in defining the scope of the governmental functions deemed protected under National League of Cities.  In that case the Court set forth examples of protected and unprotected functions, see 426 U. S., at 851, 854, n. 18 , but provided no explanation of how those examples were identified.  The only other case in which the Court has had occasion to address the problem is Long Island.  5 We there observed: “The determination of whether a federal law impairs a state’s authority with respect to ‘areas of traditional [state] functions’ may at times be a difficult one.” <citedDecision>455 U. S., at 684</citedDecision> , quoting National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 852 .  The accuracy of that statement is demonstrated by this Court’s own difficulties in Long Island in developing a workable standard for “traditional governmental functions.” We relied in large part there on “the historical reality that the operation of railroads is not among the functions traditionally performed by state and local governments,” but we *540 simultaneously disavowed “a static historical view of state functions generally immune from federal regulation.” <citedDecision>455 U. S., at 686</citedDecision> (first emphasis added; second emphasis in original).  We held that the inquiry into a particular function’s “traditional” nature was merely a means of determining whether the federal statute at issue unduly handicaps “basic state prerogatives,” <citedDecision>id., at 686-687</citedDecision> , but we did not offer an explanation of what makes one state function a “basic prerogative” and another function not basic.  Finally, having disclaimed a rigid reliance on the historical pedigree of state involvement in a particular area, we nonetheless found it appropriate to emphasize the extended historical record of federal involvement in the field of rail transportation.  <citedDecision>Id., at 687-689</citedDecision> .  Many constitutional standards involve “undoubte[d] .  .  .  gray areas,” Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 558 (1975) (dissenting opinion), and, despite the difficulties that this Court and other courts have encountered so far, it normally might be fair to venture the assumption that case-by-case development would lead to a workable standard for determining whether a particular governmental function should be immune from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.  A further cautionary note is sounded, however, by the Court’s experience in the related field of state immunity from federal taxation.  In South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437 (1905), the Court held for the first time that the state tax immunity recognized in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871), extended only to the “ordinary” and “strictly governmental” instrumentalities of state governments and not to instrumentalities “used by the State in the carrying on of an ordinary private business.” 199 U. S., at 451, 461 .

 With the abandonment of National League of Cities , all that stands between the remaining essentials of state sovereignty and Congress is the for self-restraint.  The problems of federalism in an integrated national economy are capable of more responsible resolution than holding that the States as States retain no status apart from that which Congress chooses to let them retain.  The proper resolution, I suggest, lies in weighing state autonomy as a factor in the balance when interpreting the means by which Congress can exercise its authority on the States as States.  It is insufficient, in assessing the validity of congressional regulation of a State pursuant to the commerce power, to ask only whether the same regulation would be valid if enforced against a private party.  That reasoning, embodied in the majority opinion, is inconsistent with the spirit of our Constitution.  It remains relevant that a State is being regulated, as National League of Cities and every recent case have recognized.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, supra; Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., <citedDecision>455 U. S. 678, 684</citedDecision> (1982); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 287-288 (1981); National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 841-846 .  As far as the Constitution is concerned, a State should not be equated with any private litigant.  Cf. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 428 (1979) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (criticizing the ability of a state court to treat a sister State no differently than a private litigant).  Instead, the autonomy of a State is an essential component of federalism.  If state autonomy is ignored in assessing the means by which Congress regulates matters affecting commerce, then federalism becomes irrelevant simply because the set activities remaining beyond the reach of such a commerce power “may well be negligible.” Ante, at 545.  It has been difficult for this Court to craft bright fining the scope of the state autonomy protected by National *589 League of Cities.
