<p id="Aux">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b248-7">Respondent J. W. Gamble, an inmate of the Texas Department of Corrections, was injured on November 9, 1973, while performing a prison work assignment. On February 11, 1974, he instituted this civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. § 1983,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> complaining of the treatment he received after the injury. Named as defendants were the petitioners, W. J. Estelle, Jr., Director of the Department of Corrections, H. H. Husbands, warden of the prison, and Dr. Ralph Gray, medical director of the Department and chief medical officer of the prison hospital. The District Court, <em>sua sponte, </em>dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with instructions to reinstate the complaint. 516 F. 2d 937 (CA5 1975). We granted certiorari, 424 U. S. 907 (1976).</p>
<p id="b249-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="99">*99</page-number>I</p>
<p id="b249-5">Because the complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim, we must take as true its handwritten, <em>pro se </em>allegations. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Pate, </em>378 U. S. 546 (1964). According to the complaint, Gamble was injured on November 9, 1973, when a bale of cotton<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> fell on him while he was unloading a truck. He continued to work but after four hours he became stiff and was granted a pass to the unit hospital. At the hospital a medical assistant, “Captain” Blunt, checked him for a hernia and sent him back to his cell. Within two hours the pain became so intense that Gamble returned to the hospital where he was given pain pills by an inmate nurse and then was examined by a doctor. The following day, Gamble saw a Dr. Astone who diagnosed the injury as a lower back strain, prescribed Zactirin (a pain reliever) and Robaxin (a muscle relaxant),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and placed respondent on “cell-pass, cell-feed” status for two days, allowing him to remain in his cell at all times except for showers. On November 12, Gamble again saw Dr. Astone who continued the medication and cell-pass, cell-feed for another seven days. He also ordered that respondent be moved from an upper to a lower bunk for one week, but the prison authorities did not comply with that directive. The following week, Gamble returned to Dr. Astone. The doctor continued the muscle relaxant but prescribed a new pain reliever, Febridyne, and placed respondent on cell-pass for seven days, permitting him to remain in his cell except for meals and showers. On November 26, respondent again saw Dr. Astone, who put respondent back on the original pain reliever for five days and continued the cell-pass for another week.</p>
<p id="b250-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="100">*100</page-number>On December 3, despite Gamble's statement that his back hurt as much as it had the first day, Dr. Astone took him off cell-pass, thereby certifying him to be capable of light work. At the same time, Dr. Astone prescribed Febridyne for seven days. Gamble then went to a Major Muddox and told him that he was in too much pain to work. Muddox had respondent moved to “administrative segregation.” <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 5, Gamble wa,s taken before the prison disciplinary committee, apparently because of his refusal to work. When the committee heard his complaint of back pain 'and high blood pressure, it directed that he be seen by another doctor.</p>
<p id="b250-4">On December 6, respondent saw petitioner Gray, who performed a urinalysis, blood test, and blood pressure measurement. Dr. Gray prescribed the drug Ser-Ap-Es for the high blood pressure and more Febridyne for the back pain. The following week respondent again saw Dr. Gray, who continued the Ser-Ap-Es for an additional 30 days. The prescription was not filled for four days, however, because the staff lost it. Respondent went to the unit hospital twice more in December; both times he was seen by Captain Blunt, who prescribed Tiognolos (described as a muscle relaxant). For all of December, respondent remained in administrative segregation.</p>
<p id="b250-5">In early January, Gamble was told on two occasions that he would be sent to the “farm” if he did not return to work. He refused, nonetheless, claiming to be in too much pain. On January 7, 1974, he requested to go on sick call for his back pain and migraine headaches. After an initial refusal, he saw Captain Blunt who prescribed sodium salicylate (a <page-number citation-index="1" label="101">*101</page-number>pain reliever) for seven days and Ser-Ap-Es for 30 days. Respondent returned to Captain Blunt on January 17 and January 25, and received renewals of the pain reliever prescription both times. Throughout the month, respondent was kept in administrative segregation.</p>
<p id="b251-5">On January 31, Gamble was brought before the prison disciplinary committee for his refusal to work in early January. He told the committee that he could not work because of his severe back pain and his high blood pressure. Captain Blunt testified that Gamble was in “first class” medical condition. The committee, with no further medical examination or testimony, placed respondent in solitary confinement.</p>
<p id="b251-6">Four days later, on February 4, at 8 a. m., respondent asked to see a doctor for chest pains and “blank outs.” It was not until 7:30 that night that a medical assistant examined him and ordered him hospitalized. The following day a Dr. Heaton performed an electrocardiogram; one day later respondent was placed on Quinidine for treatment of irregular cardiac rhythm and moved to administrative segregation. On February 7, respondent again experienced pain in his chest, left arm, and back and asked to see a doctor. The guards refused. He asked again the next day. The guards again refused. Finally, on February 9, he was allowed to see Dr. Heaton, who ordered the Quinidine continued for three more days. On February 11, he swore out his complaint.</p>
<p id="b251-7">II</p>
<p id="b251-8">The gravamen of respondent’s § 1983 complaint is that petitioners have subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Califor</em><page-number citation-index="1" label="102">*102</page-number><em>nia, </em>370 U. S. 660 (1962). We therefore base our evaluation of respondent’s complaint on those Amendments and our decisions interpreting them.</p>
<p id="b252-5">The history of the constitutional prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishments” has been recounted at length in prior opinions of the Court and need not be repeated here. See, <em>e. g., Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U. S. 153, 169-173 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ. (hereinafter joint opinion)); see also Granucci, Nor Cruel and Unusual Punishment Inflicted: The Original Meaning, 57 Calif. L. Rev. 839 (1969). It suffices to note that the primary concern of the drafters was to proscribe “torture [s] ” and other “bar-bar[ous]” methods of punishment. <em>Id., </em>at 842. Accordingly, this Court first applied the Eighth Amendment by comparing challenged methods of execution to concededly inhuman techniques of punishment. See <em>Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>99 U. S. 130, 136 (1879) (“[I]t is safe to affirm that punishments of torture . . . and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbidden by that amendment . . .”); <em>In re Kemmler, </em>136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890) (“Punishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death . . .”).</p>
<p id="b252-6">Our more recent cases, however, have held that the Amendment proscribes more than physically barbarous punishments. See, <em>e. g., Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>at 171 (joint opinion); <em>Trop </em>v. <em>Dulles, </em>356 U. S. 86, 100-101 (1958); <em>Weems </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 U. S. 349, 373 (1910). The Amendment embodies “broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency . . . ,” <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>404 F. 2d 571, 579 (CA8 1968), against which we must evaluate penal measures. Thus, we have held repugnant to the Eighth Amendment punishments which are incompatible with “the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,” <em>Trop </em>v. <em>Dulles, supra, </em>at 101; see also <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>at 172-173 (joint opinion); <em>Weems </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 378, <page-number citation-index="1" label="103">*103</page-number>or which “involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,” <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>at 173 (joint opinion); see also <em>Louisiana ex rel. Francis </em>v. <em>Resweber, </em>329 U. S. 459, 463 <em>(1947); Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Utah, supra, </em>at 136.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b253-5">These elementary principles establish the government’s obligation to provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by incarceration. An inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met. In the worst cases, such a failure may actually produce physical “torture or a lingering death,” <em>In re Kemmler, supra, </em>the evils of most immediate concern to the drafters of the Amendment. In less serious cases, denial of medical care may result in pain and suffering which no one suggests would serve any penological purpose. Cf. <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>at 182-183 (joint opinion). The infliction of such unnecessary suffering is inconsistent with contemporary standards of decency as manifested in modern legislation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> codifying the eommon<page-number citation-index="1" label="104">*104</page-number>law view that “it is but just that the public be required to care for the prisoner, who cannot by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, care for himself.” <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>
<p id="Ap1">We therefore conclude that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,” <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>at 173 (joint opinion), proscribed by the Eighth Amendment. This is true whether the indifference is manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner’s needs<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical <page-number citation-index="1" label="105">*105</page-number>care<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Regardess of how evidenced, deliberate indifference to a prisoner’s serious illness or injury states a cause of action under § 1983.</p>
<p id="b255-5">This conclusion does not mean, however, that every claim by a prisoner that he has not received adequate medical treatment states a violation of the Eighth Amendment. An accident, although it may produce added anguish, is not on that basis alone to be characterized as wanton infliction of unnecessary pain. In <em>Louisiana ex rel. Francis </em>v. <em>Resweber, </em>329 U. S. 459 (1947), for example, the Court concluded that it was not unconstitutional to force a prisoner to undergo a second effort to electrocute him after a mechanical malfunction had thwarted the first attempt. Writing for the plurality, Mr. Justice Reed reasoned that the second execution would not violate the Eighth Amendment because the first attempt was an “unforeseeable accident.” <em>Id., </em>at 464. Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s concurrence, based solely on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, concluded that since the first attempt had failed because of “an innocent misadventure,” <em>id., </em>at 470, the second would not be “ ‘repugnant to the conscience of mankind,’ ” <em>id., </em>at 471, quoting <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U. S. 319, 323 (1937).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b255-6">Similarly, in the medical context, an inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care cannot be said to constitute “an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” or to be <page-number citation-index="1" label="106">*106</page-number>“repugnant to the conscience of mankind.” Thus, a complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment. Medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner. In order to state a cognizable claim, a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. It is only such indifference that can offend “evolving standards of decency” in violation of the Eighth Amendment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b256-5">Ill</p>
<p id="b256-6">Against this backdrop, we now consider whether respondent’s complaint states a cognizable § 1983 claim. The handwritten <em>pro se </em>document is to be liberally construed. As the Court unanimously held in <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Kerner, </em>404 U. S. 519 (1972), a <em>pro se </em>complaint, “however inartfully pleaded,” must be held to “less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers” and can only be dismissed for failure to state a claim if it appears “ 'beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.’ ” <em>Id., </em>at 520-521, quoting <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U. S. 41, 45-46 (1957).</p>
<p id="b257-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="107">*107</page-number>Even applying these liberal standards, however, Gamble’s claims against Dr. Gray, both in his capacity as treating physician and as medical director of the Corrections Department, are not cognizable under § 1983. Gamble was seen by medical personnel on 17 occasions spanning a three-month period: by Dr. Astone five times; by Dr. Gray twice; by Dr. Heaton three times; by an unidentified doctor and inmate nurse on the day of the injury; and by medical assistant Blunt six times. They treated his back injury, high blood pressure, and heart problems. Gamble has disclaimed any objection to the treatment provided for his high blood pressure and his heart problem; his complaint is “based solely on the lack of diagnosis and inadequate treatment of his back injury.” Response to Pet. for Cert. 4; see also Brief for Respondent 19. The doctors diagnosed his injury as a lower back strain and treated it with bed rest, muscle relaxants, and pain relievers. Respondent contends that more should have been done by way of diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a number of options that were not pursued. <em>Id., </em>at 17, 19. The Court of Appeals agreed, stating: “Certainly an X-ray of [Gamble’s] lower back might have been in order and other tests conducted that would have led to appropriate diagnosis and treatment for the daily pain and suffering he was experiencing.” 516 F. 2d, at 941. But the question whether an X-ray — or additional diagnostic techniques or forms of treatment — is indicated is a classic example of a matter for medical judgment. A medical decision not to order an X-ray, or like measures, does not represent cruel and unusual punishment. At most it is medical malpractice, and as such the proper forum is the state court under the Texas Tort Claims Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals was in error in holding that the alleged insufficiency of the <page-number citation-index="1" label="108">*108</page-number>medical treatment required reversal and remand. That portion of the judgment of the District Court should have been affirmed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b258-5">The Court of Appeals focused primarily on the alleged actions of the doctors, and did not separately consider whether the allegations against the Director of the Department of Corrections, Estelle, and the warden of the prison, Husbands, stated a cause of action. Although we reverse the judgment as to the medical director, we remand the case to the Court of Appeals to allow it an opportunity to consider, in conformity with this opinion, whether a cause of action has been stated against the other prison officials.</p>
