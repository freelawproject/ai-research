[9] The most compelling criticism of the Ehrlich study is *236 that its conclusions are extremely sensitive to the choice of the time period included in the regression analysis. Analysis of Ehrlich's data reveals that all empirical support for the deterrent effect of capital punishment disappears when the five most recent years are removed from his time seriesthat is to say, whether a decrease in the execution risk corresponds to an increase or a decrease in the murder rate depends on the ending point of the sample period. [10] This finding has cast severe doubts on the reliability of Ehrlich's tentative conclusions. [11] Indeed, a recent regression study, based on Ehrlich's theoretical model but using cross-section state data for the years 1950 and 1960, found no support for the conclusion that executions act as a deterrent. [12] The Ehrlich study, in short, is of little, if any, assistance in assessing the deterrent impact of the death penalty. Accord, Commonwealth v. O'Neal,  Mass. , , 339 N.E.2d 676 , 684 (1975). The evidence I reviewed in Furman [13] remains convincing, in my view, that "capital punishment is not necessary as a deterrent to crime in our society." 408 U.S. , at 353 . The justification for the death penalty must be found elsewhere. The other principal purpose said to be served by the death penalty is retribution. [14] The notion that retribution *237 can serve as a moral justification for the sanction of death finds credence in the opinion of my Brothers STEWART, POWELL, and STEVENS, and that of my Brother WHITE in Roberts v. Louisiana, post, p. 337. See also Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 394-395 (BURGER, C. J., dissenting).

. retain the death penalty for crime?" A substantial majority of the ballots cast answered "Yes." Of 2,348,005 ballots cast, 1,159,348 voted "Yes," 730,649 voted "No," and 458,008 were blank. See Commonwealth v. O'Neal,  Mass. , , and n. 1. 339 N.E.2d 676 , 708, and n. 1 (1975) (Reardon, J., dissenting). A December 1972 Gallup poll indicated that 57% of the people favored the death penalty, while a June 1973 Harris survey showed support of 59%.

J. Orthopsychiatry 669 (1975); W. Bowers, Executions in America 121-163 (1974). [14] In Furman, I considered several additional purposes arguably served by the death penalty. 408 U.S. , at 314 , 342, 355-358. The only additional purpose mentioned in the opinions in these cases is specific deterrencepreventing the murderer from committing another crime. Surely life imprisonment and, if necessary, solitary confinement would fully accomplish this purpose. Accord, Commonwealth v. O'Neal, , Mass. , , 339 N.E.2d 676 , 685 (1975); People v. Anderson, 6 Cal. 3d 628 , 651, 493 P.2d 880 , 896, cert. denied, 406 U.S. 958 (1972). [15] See, e. g., H. Hart, Punishment and Responsibility 8-10, 71-83 (1968); H.
