**Lead Opinion**
 Federal double jeopardy standards were not applicable against the States.  Only when a kind of jeopardy subjected a defendant to “a hardship so acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it,” id., at 328 , did the Fourteenth Amendment apply.  The order *794 for a new trial was affirmed.  In subsequent appeals from state courts, the Court continued to apply this lesser Palko standard.  See, e. g., Brock v. North Carolina, 344 U. S. 424 (1953).  Recently, however, this Court has “increasingly looked to the specific guarantees of the [Bill of Rights] to determine whether a state criminal trial was conducted with due process of law.” Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 18 (1967).  In an increasing number of cases, the Court “has rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a ‘watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights ....’” Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1, 10-11</citedDecision> (1964) , 12 Only last Term we found that the right to trial by jury in criminal cases was “fundamental to the American scheme of justice,” Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  13 For the same reasons, we today find that the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents a fundamental ideal in our constitutional heritage, and that it should apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Insofar as it is inconsistent with this holding, Palko v. Connecticut is overruled.  Palko represented an approach to basic constitutional rights which this Court’s recent decisions have rejected.  It was cut of the same cloth as Betts v. Brady, 316 IT.  S. 455 (1942), the case which held that a criminal defendant’s right to counsel was to be determined by deciding in each case whether the denial of that right was “shocking to the universal sense of justice.” Id., at 462 .  It *795 relied upon Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908), which held that the right against compulsory self-incrimination was not an element of Fourteenth Amendment due process.  Betts was overruled by Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963); Twining , by Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1964).  Our recent cases have thoroughly rejected the Palko notion that basic constitutional rights can be denied by the States as long as the totality of the circumstances does not disclose a denial of “fundamental fairness.” Once it is decided that a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is “fundamental to the American scheme of justice,” Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, at 149 , the same constitutional standards apply against both the State and Federal Governments.  Palko’s roots had thus been cut away years ago.  We today only recognize the inevitable.  The fundamental nature of the guarantee against double jeopardy can hardly be doubted.  Its origins can be traced to Greek and Roman times, and it became established in the common law of England long before this Nation’s independence.  14 See Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, 151-155 (1959) (Black, J., dissenting).
