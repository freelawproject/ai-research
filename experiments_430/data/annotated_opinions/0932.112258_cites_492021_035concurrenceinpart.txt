**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 Notwithstanding, today the Court abandons the premise on which Martinez was grounded.  This casual discarding of “ ‘the secure foundation’ ” of considered precedent ill serves the orderly development of the law. See Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 190-191 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring) (quoting B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921)).  II In lieu of Martinez’s rationale, which properly takes into consideration the effects that prison regulations have on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners, the Court applies a manipulable “reasonableness” standard to a set of regulations that too easily may be interpreted to authorize arbitrary rejections of literature addressed to inmates.  As I pointed out in my partial dissent in Turner , an “open-ended ‘reasonableness’ standard makes it much too easy to uphold restrictions on prisoners’ First Amendment rights on the basis of administrative concerns and speculation about possible security risks rather than on the basis of evidence that the restrictions *428 are needed to further an important governmental interest.” 482 U. S., at 101, n. 1 .  To be sure, courts must give prison administrators some berth to combat the “Herculean obstacles” blocking their efforts to maintain security and prevent escapes or other criminal conduct, see Martinez, 416 U. S., at 404 , and I do not object to those regulations clearly targeted at such interests.  11 Nevertheless, I agree with the Court of Appeals that provisions allowing prison officials to reject a publication if they find its contents are “detrimental” to “security, good order, or discipline” or “might facilitate criminal activity” are impermissibly ambiguous.  See Abbott v. Meese, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 193, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d 1166, 1173</citedDecision> (1987).  The term “detrimental” invites so many interpretations that it scarcely checks administrators’ actions.  Similarly, “might facilitate” —in contrast with “encourage” or “advocate” — so attenuates the causal connection between expression and proscribed conduct that the warden has virtually free rein to censor incoming publications.  Despite this vagueness, the Court accepts petitioners’ assertion that they need “broad discretion” to prevent internal disorder, and thus holds that all the regulations are facially valid.  See ante, at 416.  This premature leap of faith creates a presumption that rejections pursuant to these regulations are “reasonable” — a presumption that makes likely far less judicial protection of publishers’ rights than I believe the First Amendment requires.  As was Justice Blackmun in *429 Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 593 (1984) (concurring in judgment), I am concerned that the Court today too readily “shbstitute[s] the rhetoric of judicial deference for meaningful scrutiny of constitutional claims in the prison setting.” Cf. O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342, 358 (1987) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Jones, 433 U. S., at 142-143 (Marshall, J., dissenting).

 In sum, the record convinces me that under either the Martinez standard or the more deferential “reasonableness” standard these *431 regulations are an impermissibly exaggerated response to security concerns.  Cf. Turner, 482 U. S., at 89-90 .  m If a prison official deems part of a publication’s content— even just one page of a book — to present an intolerable security risk, the Bureau’s regulations authorize the official to return the entire issue to the publisher.  See 28 CFR § 540.71 (e) (1988).  In their challenge to this all-or-nothing rule, respondents argue that First Amendment interests easily could be accommodated if administrators omitted the objectionable material and forwarded the rest of the publication to the inmate.  The District Court, however, found that “defendants’ fears” that “such censorship would create more discontent than the current practice” were “reasonably founded.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  To the contrary, the Court of Appeals applied the Martinez standard and held that “rejection of the balance is not ‘generally necessary’ to protect the legitimate governmental interest involved in the portion properly rejected.” 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 193-194, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d, at 1173-1174</citedDecision> .  In this Court petitioners argue that on remand the Court of Appeals should conduct “a detailed analysis of the evidence in this case” to determine if the all-or-nothing rule is “reasonable.” Brief for Petitioners 31.  “The validity of that policy,” they continue, “will depend, among other things, on the security and administrative justifications for that policy, the availability of alternative courses of action, and the costs and risks associated with employing those alternatives.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> It is remarkable that after 16 years of litigation petitioners have failed to develop an argument that tells us anything about the assumed security or administrative justificatioñ for this rule.  Even more remarkable is the Court’s conclusion that since it does not apply the Martinez standard, it need not examine the appropriateness of the District Court’s find *432 ing that the rule was reasonable.  See ante, at 419.  A review of the record reveals that the Court thus defers to “findings” of a security threat that even prison officials admitted to be nonexistent.  There is no evidence that delivery of only part of a publication would endanger prison security.  17 Rather, the primary *433 justification advanced for the all-or-nothing rule was administrative convenience.  See App. 41, 68.
