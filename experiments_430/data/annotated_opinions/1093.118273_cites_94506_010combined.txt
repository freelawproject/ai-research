**Combined Opinion**
 The court noted that the revocation of hunting and fishing rights was neither discussed during the Treaty negotiations nor mentioned in the Treaty itself.  Id., at 920.  The court also rejected the State's argument that this Court's decision in Oregon Dept. of Fish and *188 Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985), required a different result.  124 F. 3d, at 921.  Third, the court rejected the State's argument that, under the "equal footing doctrine," Minnesota's entrance into the Union extinguished any Indian treaty rights.  Id., at 926-929.  Specifically, the Court of Appeals found no evidence of congressional intent in enacting the Minnesota statehood Act to abrogate Chippewa usufructuary rights, id., at 929, and it rejected the argument that Ward v. Race Horse, <citedDecision>163 U. S. 504</citedDecision> (1896), controlled the resolution of this issue, 124 F. 3d, at 926-927.  In sum, the Court of Appeals held that the Chippewa retained their usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty with respect to land located in the State of Minnesota.  This conclusion is consistent with the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit's earlier decision holding that the Chippewa retained those same rights with respect to the ceded land located in Wisconsin.  Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Voigt, 700 F. 2d 341 , appeal dism'd and cert. denied sub nom. Besadny v. Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, 464 U. S. 805 (1983) (Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens, JJ., would affirm).  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied a petition for rehearing and a suggestion for rehearing en banc.  The State of Minnesota, the landowners, and the counties all filed petitions for writs of certiorari, and we granted the State's petition.  524 U. S. 915 (1998).

United States v. Dion, supra, at 740 .  There is no such "clear evidence" of congressional intent to abrogate the Chippewa Treaty rights here.  The relevant statuteMinnesota's enabling Actprovides in relevant part: "[T]he State of Minnesota shall be one, and is hereby declared to be one, of the United States of America, and admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever." Act of May 11, 1858, 11 Stat. 285 .  This language, like the rest of the Act, makes no mention of Indian treaty rights; it provides no clue that Congress considered the reserved rights of the Chippewa and decided to abrogate those rights when it passed the Act.  The State concedes that the Act is silent in this regard, Brief for Petitioners 36, and the State does not point to any legislative history describing the effect of the Act on Indian treaty rights.  With no direct support for its argument, the State relies principally on this Court's decision in Ward v. Race Horse, <citedDecision>163 U. S. 504</citedDecision> (1896).  In <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> , we held that a Treaty reserving to a Tribe "`the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States, so long as game may be found thereon, and so long as peace subsists among the whites and Indians on the borders of the hunting districts' " terminated when Wyoming became a State in 1890.  <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 507 (quoting Art. 4 of the Treaty).  This case does not bear the weight the State places on it, however, because it has been qualified by later decisions of this Court. The first part of the holding in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> was based on the "equal footing doctrine," the constitutional principle that all States are admitted to the Union with the same attributes of sovereignty ( i.  e., on equal footing) as the original 13 States.  See Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  As relevant here, it prevents the Federal Government from impairing *204 fundamental attributes of state sovereignty when it admits new States into the Union.  Id., at 573 .  According to the <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> Court, because the treaty rights conflicted irreconcilably with state regulation of natural resources "an essential attribute of its governmental existence," 163 U. S., at 516the treaty rights were held an invalid impairment of Wyoming's sovereignty.  Thus, those rights could not survive Wyoming's admission to the Union on "equal footing" with the original States.  But <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> rested on a false premise.  As this Court's subsequent cases have made clear, an Indian tribe's treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on state land are not irreconcilable with a State's sovereignty over the natural resources in the State.  See, e. g., Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., supra ; see also Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194 (1975).  Rather, Indian treaty rights can coexist with state management of natural resources.  Although States have important interests in regulating wildlife and natural resources within their borders, this authority is shared with the Federal Government when the Federal Government exercises one of its enumerated constitutional powers, such as treaty making.  U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  See, e. g., Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920); Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529 (1976); United States v. Winans, 198 U. S., at 382-384 ; United States v. Forty-three Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U. S. 188 (1876).
**Combined Opinion**
 Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath *205 Tribe, 473 U. S., at 765, n. 16 .  We have repeatedly reaffirmed state authority to impose reasonable and necessary nondiscriminatory regulations on Indian hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in the interest of conservation.  See Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 391 U. S. 392, 398 (1968); Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S., at 682 ; Antoine v. Washington, supra, at 207-208.  This "conservation necessity" standard accommodates both the State's interest in management of its natural resources and the Chippewa's federally guaranteed treaty rights.  Thus, because treaty rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land within state boundaries.  [7] We do not understand Justice Thomas to disagree with this fundamental conclusion.  <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> rested on the premise that treaty rights are irreconcilable with state sovereignty.  It is this conclusionthe conclusion undergirding the <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> Court's equal footing holdingthat we have consistently rejected over the years.  Justice Thomas' only disagreement is as to the scope of state regulatory authority.  His disagreement is premised on a purported distinction between "rights" and "privileges." This Court has never used a distinction between rights and privileges *206 to justify any differences in state regulatory authority.  Moreover, as Justice Thomas acknowledges, post, at 223 (dissenting opinion), the starting point for any analysis of these questions is the treaty language itself.  The Treaty must be interpreted in light of the parties' intentions, with any ambiguities resolved in favor of the Indians.  Winters v. United States, 207 U. S., at 576-577 .  There is no evidence that the Chippewa understood any fine legal distinctions between rights and privileges.  Moreover, under Justice Thomas' view of the 1837 Treaty, the guarantee of hunting, fishing, and gathering privileges was essentially an empty promise because it gave the Chippewa nothing that they did not already have.  The equal footing doctrine was only part of the holding in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> , however.  We also announced an alternative holding: The treaty rights at issue were not intended to survive Wyoming's statehood.  We acknowledged that Congress, in the exercise of its authority over territorial lands, has the power to secure off-reservation usufructuary rights to Indian tribes through a treaty, and that "it would be also within the power of Congress to continue them in the State, on its admission into the Union." <citedDecision>163 U. S., at 515</citedDecision> .  We also acknowledged that if Congress intended the rights to survive statehood, there was no need for Congress to preserve those rights explicitly in the statehood Act.  We concluded, however, that the particular rights in the Treaty at issue there "the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States"were not intended to survive statehood.  <citedDecision>Id., at 514</citedDecision> ; see <citedDecision>id., at 514-515</citedDecision> .  The Chief Justice reads <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> to establish a rule that "temporary and precarious" treaty rights, as opposed to treaty rights "which were `of such a nature as to imply their perpetuity,' " are not intended to survive statehood.  Post, at 219.  But the "temporary and precarious" language in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> is too broad to be useful in distinguishing rights that survive statehood from those that do not.  In Race *207 Horse, the Court concluded that the right to hunt on federal lands was temporary because Congress could terminate the right at any time by selling the lands.  <citedDecision>163 U. S., at 510</citedDecision> .  Under this line of reasoning, any right created by operation of federal law could be described as "temporary and precarious," because Congress could eliminate the right whenever it wished.  In other words, the line suggested by <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> is simply too broad to be useful as a guide to whether treaty rights were intended to survive statehood.  The focus of the <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> inquiry is whether Congress (more precisely, because this is a treaty, the Senate) intended the rights secured by the 1837 Treaty to survive statehood.  <citedDecision>Id., at 514-515</citedDecision> .  The 1837 Treaty itself defines the circumstances under which the rights would terminate: when the exercise of those rights was no longer the "pleasure of the President." There is no suggestion in the Treaty that the President would have to conclude that the privileges should end when a State was established in the area.  Moreover, unlike the rights at issue in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> , there is no fixed termination point to the 1837 Treaty rights.  The Treaty in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> contemplated that the rights would continue only so long as the hunting grounds remained unoccupied and owned by the United States; the happening of these conditions was "clearly contemplated" when the Treaty was ratified.  <citedDecision>Id., at 509</citedDecision> .  By contrast, the 1837 Treaty does not tie the duration of the rights to the occurrence of some clearly contemplated event.  Finally, we note that there is nothing inherent in the nature of reserved treaty rights to suggest that they can be extinguished by implication at statehood.  Treaty rights are not impliedly terminated upon statehood.  Wisconsin v. Hitchcock, 201 U. S. 202, 213-214 (1906); Johnson v. Gearlds, 234 U. S. 422, 439-440 (1914).  The <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> Court's decision to the contrarythat Indian treaty rights were impliedly repealed by Wyoming's statehood Actwas informed by that Court's conclusion that the Indian treaty rights were inconsistent with state sovereignty *208 over natural resources and thus that Congress (the Senate) could not have intended the rights to survive statehood.  But as we described above, Indian treaty-based usufructuary rights are not inconsistent with state sovereignty over natural resources.  See supra, at 204-205.  Thus, contrary to the State's contentions, <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> does not compel the conclusion that Minnesota's admission to the Union extinguished Chippewa usufructuary rights guaranteed by the 1837 Treaty.  Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is affirmed.  It is so ordered.  Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.  The Court holds that the various Bands of Chippewa Indians retain a usufructuary right granted to them in an 1837 Treaty.  To reach this result, the Court must successively conclude that: (1) an 1850 Executive Order explicitly revoking the privilege as authorized by the 1837 Treaty was unlawful; (2) an 1855 Treaty under which certain Chippewa Bands ceded "all" interests to the land does not include the treaty right to come onto the land and hunt; and (3) the admission of Minnesota into the Union in 1858 did not terminate the discretionary hunting privilege, despite established precedent of this Court to the contrary.  Because I believe that each one of these three conclusions is demonstrably wrong, I dissent.

 Second, while it is important to the Court that the Treaty "is devoid of any language expressly mentioningmuch less abrogatingusufructuary rights," ibid., the definition of "usufructuary rights" explains further why this is so. Usufructuary rights are "a real right of limited duration on the property of another." See Black's Law Dictionary 1544 (6th ed. 1990).  It seems to me that such a right would fall clearly under the sweeping language of the Treaty under any reasonable interpretation, and that this is not a case where "even `learned lawyers' of the day would probably have offered differing interpretations of the [treaty language]." Cf. Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 677 (1979).  And third, although the Court notes that in other treaties the United States sometimes expressly mentioned cessions of usufructuary rights, there was no need to do so in this case, because the settled expectation of the United States was that the 1850 Executive Order had terminated the hunting rights of the Chippewa.  Thus, rather than applying the plain and unequivocal language of the 1855 Treaty, the Court holds that "all" does not in fact mean "all." *219 IV Finally, I note my disagreement with the Court's treatment of the equal footing doctrine, and its apparent overruling sub silentio of a precedent of 103 years' vintage.  In Ward v. Race Horse, <citedDecision>163 U. S. 504</citedDecision> (1896), we held that a Treaty granting the Indians "the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States, so long as game may be found thereon, and so long as peace subsists among the whites and the Indians on the borders of the hunting districts," did not survive the admission of Wyoming to the Union since the treaty right was "temporary and precarious." <citedDecision>Id., at 515</citedDecision> .  But the Court, in a feat of jurisprudential legerdemain, effectively overrules Race Horse sub silentio.  First, the Court notes that Congress may only abrogate Indian treaty rights if it clearly expresses its intent to do so. Next, it asserts that Indian hunting rights are not irreconcilable with state sovereignty, and determines that "because treaty rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land within state boundaries." Ante, at 205.  And finally, the Court hints that <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> rested on an incorrect premisethat Indian rights were inconsistent with state sovereignty.  Without saying so, this jurisprudential bait-and-switch effectively overrules <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> , a case which we reaffirmed as recently as 1985 in Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985).  <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> held merely that treaty rights which were only "temporary and precarious," as opposed to those which were "of such a nature as to imply their perpetuity," do not survive statehood.  [3] 163 U. S., *220 at 515.  Here, the hunting privileges were clearly, like those invalidated in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> , temporary and precarious: The privilege was only guaranteed "during the pleasure of the President"; the legally enforceable annuity payments themselves were to terminate after 20 years; and the Indians were on actual notice that the President might end the rights in the future, App. 78 (1837 Journal of Treaty Negotiations).  Perhaps the strongest indication of the temporary nature of the treaty rights is presented unwittingly by the Court in its repeated (and correct) characterizations of the rights as "usufructuary." As noted supra, at 218, usufructuary rights are by definition "of limited duration." Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at 1544.  Thus, even if the Executive Order is invalid; and even if the 1855 Treaty did not cover the usufructuary rights: Under <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> , the temporary and precarious treaty privileges were eliminated by the admission of Minnesota to the Union on an equal footing in 1858.  Today the Court appears to invalidate (or at least substantially limit) <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> , without offering any principled reason to do so. V The Court today invalidates for no principled reason a 149-year-old Executive Order, ignores the plain meaning of a 144-year-old treaty provision, and overrules sub silentio a 103-year-old precedent of this Court. I dissent.  Justice Thomas, dissenting.  I join The Chief Justice 2122s dissent, but also write separately because contrary to the majority's assertion, in dicta, *221 ante, at 204, our prior cases do not dictate the conclusion that the 1837 Treaty curtails Minnesota's regulatory authority.  As the Court has ruled today that the Chippewa retain the privilege to hunt, fish, and gather on the land they ceded in the 1837 Treaty, the question of the scope of the State's regulatory power over the Chippewas' exercise of those privileges assumes great significanceany limitations that the Federal Treaty may impose upon Minnesota's sovereign authority over its natural resources exact serious federalism costs.  The questions presented, however, do not require the Court to decide whether the 1837 Treaty limits the State's regulatory authority in any way.  All that they require is a judgment as to whether the usufructuary privileges at issue survive three potentially extinguishing events: President Taylor's 1850 Executive Order, the 1855 Treaty, and Minnesota's admission to the Union in 1858.  The Court nevertheless offers the following observation: "Here, the 1837 Treaty gave the Chippewa the right to hunt, fish, and gather in the ceded territory free of ter- ritorial, and later state, regulation, a privilege that others did not enjoy.
**Combined Opinion**
 Post, at 215-216.  Presumably, The Chief Justice understands the 1837 Treaty to authorize the executive action in question.  In this context, however, any general presumption about the legality of executive action runs into the principle that treaty ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the Indians.  Winters v. United States, supra, at 576 577; see also County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992).  We do not think the general presumption relied upon by The Chief Justice carries the same weight when balanced against the counter presumption specific to Indian treaties.  [6]  See also, e. g., 1846 Treaty with the Winnebago, Art. IV, 9 Stat. 878 (Government agrees to pay Winnebago Indians $40,000 "for release of hunting privileges, on the lands adjacent to their present home"); 1837 Treaty with the Sacs and Foxes, Art. 2, 7 Stat. 543 (specifically ceding "all the right to locate, for hunting or other purposes, on the land ceded in the first article of the treaty of July 15th 1830").  [7]  The Chief Justice asserts that our criticism of <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> is inappropriate given our recent "reaffirm[ation]" of that case in Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985).  Post, at 219.  Although we cited <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> in Klamath, we did not in so doing reaffirm the equal footing doctrine as a bar to the continuation of Indian treatybased usufructuary rights.  Klamath did not involve the equal footing doctrine.  Rather, we cited <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> for the second part of its holding, discussed in the text, infra, at 206-208.  See 473 U. S., at 773, n. 23 .  In any event, the <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> Court's reliance on the equal footing doctrine to terminate Indian treaty rights rested on foundations that were rejected by this Court within nine years of that decision.  See United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 382-384 (1905).  [1]  The Court's assumption that "any general presumption about the legality of executive action runs into the principle that treaty ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the Indians," ante, at 194, n.5, illogically confuses the difference between executive authority and a principle of treaty construction.  The principle of Winters v. United States, 207 U. S. 564, 567-577 (1908), and County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992), that ambiguities in treaties are to be resolved in favor of the Indians, is only relevant to determining the intent of the parties to a treaty (that is the United States and the Indian tribe), and stems from the idea that in determining the intent of the parties, Indian tribes should be given the benefit of the doubt as against the United States in cases of ambiguous treaty provisions because the United States was presumptively a more sophisticated bargainer.  See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 675-676 (1979).  But the determination of whether the President has power to enforce his revocation by removal is irrelevant to the intent of the parties to the treaty (the United States and the Chippewa in this case) and presents instead an issue of separation of powers (between the President and the Congress).  [2]  One notices the irony that where the President chose to explicitly eliminate the 1837 Treaty rights, the Court finds this specificity subsumed in the "removal order," and invalidates it as well.  [3]  The Court maintains that this reading of <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> is overbroad and would render any right created by operation of federal law "temporary and precarious." Ante, at 206.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The outer limit of what constitutes a "temporary and precarious" right is not before the Court (nor, since <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> is apparently overruled, will it ever be), but the hunting privilegesgranted in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> and by the 1837 Treaty in this case reveal themselves to be "temporary and precarious" by their plain text: The privilege in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> ended upon occupation of the hunting districts or the outbreak of hostilities, while the privilege in this case lasted only during the pleasure of the President.  Both rights were temporary and precarious, as neither was guaranteed, either expressly or impliedly, in perpetuity.  [1]  A prior case interpreting the same 1859 Treaty held that the language fixed in the land an easement for the Yakima so that they could cross private property to fish in the Columbia River.  United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 381-382 (1905).  But the Court also wrote that the Treaty did not "restrain the State unreasonably, if at all, in the regulation of the right." Id., at 384 (emphasis added).  [2]  As already noted, supra, at 222, the Court has said that "[a]bsent express federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to nondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State."
