**Combined Opinion**
 There is no occasion to review earlier decisions dealing with affirmative and negative administrative orders and obviously *148 none to overrule any of them or to repudiate or impair the doctrine they establish.  * The Court’s discussion, extraneous to the issue involved, confuses rather than clarifies.  The findings of the district court are amply sustained by the evidence, and its decree should be affirmed.  Mr. Justice McReynolds concurs in this opinion.  1 On November 13, 1935, the order was amended in matters not here relevant.  2 The hearing before the examiner lasted two days; 221 pages of testimony were taken and 34 exhibits were introduced.  3 Under United States v. Corrick, 298 U. S. 435, 440 , and United States v. Griffin, <citedDecision>303 U. S. 226, 229</citedDecision> , the doctrine of “negative orders” implies a jurisdictional defect whibh courts must consider sua sponte.  4 All except one of the prior decisions of this Court on the “negative order” doctrine involved review of action by the Interstate Commerce Commission.  United States v. Corrick, supra, note 3 , involved review of action by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act.  5 United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., 244 U. S. 82 .  Compare Federal Power Comm’n v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 304 U. S. 375 .  6 Delaware & Hudson Co. v. United States, 266 U. S. 438 .  7 United States v. Los Angeles & S. L. R. Co., 273 U. S. 299 .

 For the Commission itself had instituted, the system whereby it requested preliminary submission to it of the status of “interurban” roads.  Such a decision was at least the equivalent of a threat of prosecution Under 'the statute, and, in fact, considerable weight is given to administrative practicq in ascertaining the meaning of such legislation.  Compare United States v. Village of Hubbard, 266 U. S. 474 .  12 The initial decisión in this group of cases, the Intermountain Bate Cases, 234 U. S. 476 , held reviewable the action of the Commissiqn in refusing to grant requested consent to depart from the long-short haul clause.  (§ 4 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, *135 as amended.) While this case would seem to control the Lehigh Valley case and at least to be persuasive in the Piedmont & Northern case, it was not mentioned in them.  After these two cases, subsequent decisions in this group indicated that the “negative order” doctrine might prevent review of the refusal by the Secretary of Agriculture to accept rates for filing, the Packers and Stockyards Act prohibiting the charging of rates except those on file with the Secretary, United States v. Corrick, 298 U. S. 435 , and of the refusal to grant an increase in rates of compensation for carrying of mail, the Railway Mail Pay Act of 1916 requiring the carrier to carry the mail at the rate set, United States v. Griffin, <citedDecision>303 U. S. 226</citedDecision> .  But in both these decisions the result reached was supported by factors irrelevant to the present discussion.  On the other.hand, in Powell v. United States, 300 U. S. 276 , action of the Commission, striking from its files a tariff on the ground that a point was not served by the carrier, was held subject to review' as a command to the railway which had filed the tariff not to give the service covered by the tariff.  13 The Chicago Junction Case, 264 U. S. 258 ; Venner v. Michigan Central R. Co., 271 U. S. 127 ; Colorado v. United States, 271 U. S. 153 ; Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, 285 U. S. 382 ; United States v. Idaho, 298 U. S. 105 .  14 ... we have learned of no instance where it was held or even seriously asserted, that as to subjects which in their nature were administrative and within the competency of the Commission to decide, there was power in a court, by an exercise of original action, to enforce its conceptions as to the meaning of the' act to regulate commerce by, dealing directly with the subject irrespective of any prior affirmative command or action by the Interstate Commerce Commission.  On the contrary, by a long line of decisions, whereby applications to enforce orders of the Commission were considered and disposed of or where requests to restrain the enforcement of such orders were passed upon, it appears by the reasoning indulged in that it was never considered that there was power in the courts as an original question without previous affirmative action by the Commission to deal with what might be termed in a broad sense the administrative features of the act to regulate commerce by determining as an original question that there had been a compliance or •noncompliance with the provisions of the act.” 225 U. S. at 296-97 .  "... the recognition of a right in a court to assert the power now claimed would of necessity amount to a substitution of the court for the Commission or at all events would be to create a divided authority on a matter where from the beginning primary singleness of action and unity was deemed to be imperative.” 225 U. S. at 298-99 .
