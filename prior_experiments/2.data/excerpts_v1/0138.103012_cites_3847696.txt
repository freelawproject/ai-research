. . . “the authority and only authority is the State, and if that be so, the voice adopted by the State as its own [whether it be of its Legislature or of its Supremé Court] should utter the last word.” Thus the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson is, as Mr. Justice Holmes said, “an unconstitutional assumption of powers by courts of the United States which no lapse of time or respectable array of opinion should make us hesitate to correct.” In disapproving that doctrine we do not hold *80 unconstitutional § 34 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789 or any other Act of Congress. We merely declare that in applying the doctrine this Court and the lower courts have invaded rights whicíi in our opinion are reserved by the Constitution to the several States. Fourth. The defendant contended that by the common law of Pennsylvania as declared by its highest court in Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 307 Pa. 203; 160 A. 859, the only duty owed to the plaintiff was to refrain from wilful or wanton injury. The plaintiff denied that such is the Pennsylvania law. 24 In support of their respective contentions the parties discussed and cited many decisions of the Supreme Court of the State. The Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the question of liability is one of general law; and on thjat ground declined to decide the issue of state law. As. we hold this was error, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded to it for further proceedings in conformity with our opini o n. Reversed. Mr. Justice Cardozo took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

diversity of citizenship, plaintiff, a citizen .and resident of Pennsylvania, brought this suit to recover damages against, defendant, a New York corporation, in the federal court for the southern district of that State. The issues were whether negligence of defendant was a proximate cause of his injuries and whether negligence of plaintiff contributed. He claimed that, by hauling the car with the open door, defendant violated a duty to him. The defendant insisted that it violated no duty and that plaintiff’s injuries were caused by his own negligence. ..The jury gave him a verdict on which the trial court entered judgment; the circuit court of appeals affirmed. 90 F. (2d) 603. Defendant maintained, citing Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 307 Pa. 203; 160 A. 859, and Koontz v. B. & O. R. Co., 309 Pa. 122; 163 A. 212, that the only duty owed plaintiff was to refrain from willfully or wantonly injuring him; it argued that the courts of Pennsylvania had so ruled with respect to persons using a customary longitudinal path, as distinguished from one crossing the track. The plaintiff, insisted that the Pennsylvania decisions did not establish the rule for which the defendant contended.. Upon that issue the circuit court of appeals said (p. 604): “We need hot go into this' matter since the defendant concedes that the great weight of authority in other states is' to the contrary.- This concession is fatal to its contention, for upon questions of general law the federal courts are. free, in absence of a local statute, to exercise their independent judgment as to what the law is; and it is well settled that the question of the responsibility of a railroad for injuries caused by its servants is one of general law.” *82 Upon that basis the court held the evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the negligence of defendant. It also held the question of contributory negligence one for the jury.

Tompkins also contended that the alleged rule of the Falchetti case is not in any event applicable here because he .was struck at the 'intersection of the longitudinal pathway and a.transverse crossing. The court below found it unnecessary to consider this contention, and we leave the question open. Mr. Justice Field filed a dissenting opinion,-several sentences of which are quoted in the decision just announced. The dissent failed to impress any of his associates. It assumes that adherence to § 34 as construed involves a supervision over legislative or judicial action of the states. There is no foundation for that suggestion. Clearly the dissent of the learned Justice rests upon misapprehension of the rule.
