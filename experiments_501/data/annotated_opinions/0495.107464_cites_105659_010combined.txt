This provision was re-enacted as § 349 (a) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 267 , 8 U. S. C. § 1481 (a) (5).

Although some of the opponents, believing that citizenship was derived from the States, argued that any power to prescribe the mode for its relinquishment rested in the States, they were careful to point out that "the absence of all power from the State Legislatures would not vest it in us."

[26]  Lincoln indicated that although he was "unprepared" to be "inflexibly committed" to "any single plan of restoration," he was "fully satisfied" with the bill's provisions.  6 Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents 222-223.  [27]  Roche, The Expatriation Cases, 1963 Sup. Ct. Rev. 325 , 343.  [28] 13 Stat. 490 .  It was this provision that, after various recodifications, was held unconstitutional by this Court in Trop v. Dulles, <citedDecision>356 U. S. 86</citedDecision> .  A majority of the Court did not there hold that the provision was invalid because Congress lacked all power to expatriate an unwilling citizen.  In any event, a judgment by this Court 90 years after the Act's passage can scarcely reduce the Act's evidentiary value for determining whether Congress understood in 1865, as the Court now intimates that it did, that it lacked such power.
