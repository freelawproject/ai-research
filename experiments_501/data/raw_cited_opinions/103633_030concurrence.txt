<p id="Am1">concurring:</p>
<p id="b661-6">I wholly agree with the opinion of the Chief Justice.</p>
<p id="b661-7">Congress has in the Natural Gas Act specifically cast upon courts the duty to review orders of the Federal Power Commission fixing “just and reasonable” rates. The constitutional scope of judicial review of rate orders where Congress has denied judicial review is therefore not in issue in this case. Discussion of the problem is academic, especially since we all concur in the Chief Justice’s conclusions on the rate order here made by the Commission. But since the issue has been stirred, I add a few words because legal history still has its claims.</p>
<p id="b661-8">While the doctrine of “confiscation,” as a limitation to be enforced by the judiciary upon the legislative power</p>
<p id="AZb">to fix utility rates, was first applied in <em>Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>134 U. S. 418, that decision followed principles expounded in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Farmers’ Loan &amp; Trust Co., </em>116 U. S. 307, especially at 331. See 134 U. S. at 465-56. Mr. Chief Justice Waite, who delivered the opinion in the <em>Stone </em>case as well as in the earlier decision in <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S. 113, was therefore the author of the doctrine of “confiscation” and its corollary, “judicial review.” His view was shared by such stout respecters of legislative power over utilities as Mr. Justice Miller (see Fairman, Mr. Justice Miller and the Supreme Court, passim), Mr. Justice Bradley (see his dissent in <em>Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>134 U. S. 418, 461), and Mr. Justice Harlan. The latter, indeed, agreed with Mr. Justice Field' that the regulatory power exercised in the <em>Railroad Commission Cases, </em>116 U. S. 307, constituted an impairment of the obligation of contract. By no one was the doctrine of judicial review more emphatically accepted, and applied in favor of a public utility, than by Mr. Justice Harlan in the decision and opinion in <em>Covington &amp; Lexington Turnpike Co. </em>v. <em>Sandford, </em>164 U. S. 578, especially at 591-95.</p>
<p id="b662-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="610">*610</page-number>But while this historic controversy over the constitutional limitations upon the power of courts in rate cases is not presented here, if it be deemed that courts have nothing to do with rate-making because that task was committed exclusively to the Commission, surely it is a usurpation of the Commission’s function to tell it how it should discharge this task and how it should protect the various interests that are deemed to be in its, and not in our, keeping.</p>
