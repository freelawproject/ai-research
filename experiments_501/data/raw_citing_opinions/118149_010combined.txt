<p id="b183-3">
  Respondents, Barkat U. Khan and his corporation, entered into an agreement with petitioner, State Oil Company, to lease and operate a gas station and convenience store owned
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="8"> 
   *8
   </span>
  by State Oil. The agreement provided that respondents would obtain the station’s gasoline supply from State Oil at a price equal to a suggested retail price set by State Oil, less a margin of B.25 cents per gallon. ' 'Under the agreement, respondents could charge any amount for gasoline sold to the station’s customers, but if the price charged was higher than &gt; State Oil’s suggested retail price, the excess was to be rebated to State Oil. Respondents could sell gasoline for less than State Oil’s suggested retail price, but any such decrease would reduce their 3.25 cents-per-gallon margin.
 </p>
<p id="b184-5">
  About a year after respondents began operating the gas station, they fell behind in lease payments. State Oil then gave notice of its intent to terminate the agreement and commenced a state court proceeding to evict respondents. At State Oil’s request, the state court appointed a receiver to operate the gas station. The receiver operated the station for several months without being subject to the price restraints in respondents’ agreement with State Oil. According to respondents, the receiver obtained an overall profit margin in excess of 3.25 cents per gallon by lowering the price of regular-grade gasoline and raising the price of premium grades.
 </p>
<p id="b184-6">
  Respondents sued State Oil in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging in part that State Oil had engaged in price fixing in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act by preventing respondents from raising or lowering retail gas prices. According to the complaint, but for the agreement with State Oil, respondents could have charged different prices based on the grades of gasoline, in the same way that the receiver had, thereby achieving increased sales and profits. State Oil responded that the agreement did not actually prevent respondents from setting gasoline prices, and that, in substance, respondents did not allege a violation of antitrust laws by their claim that State Oil’s suggested retail price was not optimal.

  The District Court found that the allegations in the complaint did not state a
  <em>
   per se
  </em>
  violation of the Sherman Act because they did not establish the sort of “manifestly anti-competitive implications or pernicious effect on competition” that would justify
  <em>
   per se
  </em>
  prohibition of State Oil’s conduct. App. 43-44. Subsequently, in ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court concluded that respondents had failed to demonstrate antitrust injury or harm to competition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a. The District Court held that respondents had not shown that a difference in gasoline pricing would have increased the station’s sales; nor had they shown that State Oil had market power or that its pricing provisions affected competition in a relevant market.
  <em>

  </em>
  at 37a, 40a. Accordingly, the District Court entered summary judgment for State Oil on respondents’ Sherman Act claim.

As a consequence, most antitrust claims are analyzed under a “rule of reason,” according to which the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition, taking into account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, and the restraint’s history, nature, and effect. <span class="citation" data-id="110747"><a href="/opinion/110747/arizona-v-maricopa-county-medical-society/#343" aria-description="Citation for case: Arizona v.

The Court determined that too little was known about the competitive impact of such vertical limitations to warrant treating them as
  <em>

  </em>
  unlawful.

Justice Stewart also dissented, asserting that the publisher’s maximum price fixing scheme should be properly viewed as promoting competition, because it protected consumers from dealers such as Albrecht, who, as “the only person who could sell for home delivery the city’s only daily morning newspaper,” was “a monopolist within his own territory.”

  Thus, our reconsideration of

   Albrecht’s

  continuing validity is informed by several of our decisions, as well as a considerable body of scholarship discussing the effects of vertical restraints. Our analysis is also guided by our general view that the primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect interbrand competition. See,

  <em>
   ARCO, supra,

  at 340. Our interpretation of the Sherman Act also incorporates the notion that condemnation of practices resulting in lower prices to consumers is “especially costly” because “cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition.”

  So informed, we find it difficult to maintain that vertically imposed maximum prices could harm consumers or competition to the extent necessary to justify their
  <em>
   per se
  </em>
  invalidation. As Chief Judge Posner wrote for the Court of Appeals in this ease:
 </p>
<blockquote id="b191-8">
  “As for maximum resale price fixing, unless the supplier is a monopsonist he cannot squeeze his dealers’ margins
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="16">

  below a competitive level; the attempt to do so would just drive the dealers into the arms of a competing supplier. A supplier might, however, fix a maximum resale price in order to prevent his dealers from exploiting a monopoly position.... [Sjuppose that State Oil, perhaps to encourage ... dealer services ... has spaced its dealers sufficiently far apart to limit competition among them (or even given each of them an exclusive territory); and suppose further that Union 76 is a sufficiently distinctive and popular brand to give the dealers in it at least a modicum of monopoly power. Then State Oil might want to place a ceiling on the dealers’ resale prices in order to prevent them from exploiting that monopoly power folly. It would do this not out of disinterested malice, but in its commercial self-interest. The higher the price at which gasoline is resold, the smaller the volume sold, and so the lower the profit to the supplier if the higher profit per gallon at the higher price is being snared by the dealer.” <span class="citation" data-id="725024"><a href="/opinion/725024/barkat-u-khan-and-khan-associates-inc-v-state-oil-company/#1362" aria-description="Citation for case: Barkat U.

  less serious than the Court imagined, the

Other commentators have also explained that
  <em>
   Al-brecht’s per se

  rule has even more potential for deleterious effect on competition after our decision in
  <em>
   GTE Sylvania,

  </em>
  the likelihood of dealer monopoly power is increased. See,

Such retail market power may in fact be uncommon. See,

  In the area of antitrust law, there is a competing interest, well represented in this Court’s decisions, in recognizing and adapting to changed circumstances and the lessons of accumulated experience. Thus, the general presumption that legislative changes should be left to Congress has less force with respect to the Sherman Act in light of the accepted view that Congress “expected the courts to give shape to the statute’s broad mandate by drawing on common-law tra

As we have explained, the term “restraint of trade,” as used in § 1, also “invokes the common law itself, and not merely the static content that the common law had assigned to the term in 1890.”

  Although we do not “lightly assume that the economic realities underlying earlier decisions have changed, or that earlier judicial perceptions of those realities were in error,” we have noted that “different sorts of agreements” may amount to restraints of trade “in varying times and circumstances,” and “[i]t would make no sense to create out of the single term ‘restraint of trade’ a chronologically schizoid statute, in which a ‘rule of reason’ evolves with new circumstances and new wisdom, but a line of

  we of course do not hold that all vertical maximum price fixing is

  lawful. Instead, vertical maximum priee fixing, like the majority of commercial arrangements subject-to the antitrust laws, should be evaluated under the rule of reason.
