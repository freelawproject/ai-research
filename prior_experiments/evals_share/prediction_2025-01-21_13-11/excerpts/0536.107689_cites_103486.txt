Case of interest: Ex Parte Hull (1941)
-----------------------
y the repeated references in the statute,[9] but also by the history of the great writ.[10] Its province, shaped to guarantee the most fundamental of all rights,[11] is to provide an effective and speedy instrument by which judicial inquiry may be had into the legality of the detention of a person. See Peyton v. Rowe, ante, p. 54.[12]
