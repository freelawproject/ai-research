 .”).  See also Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459, 464 (1947) (second attempt at electrocution found not to violate *171 Eighth Amendment, since failure of initial execution attempt was “an unforeseeable accident” and “[t]here [was] no purpose to inflict unnecessary pain nor any unnecessary pain involved in the proposed execution”).  But the Court has not confined the prohibition embodied in the Eighth Amendment to “barbarous” methods that were generally outlawed in the 18th century.  Instead, the Amendment has been interpreted in a flexible and dynamic manner.  The Court early recognized that “a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth.” Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 373 (1910).  Thus the Clause forbidding “cruel and unusual” punishments “is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.” Id., at 378 .  See also Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 429-430 (Powell, J., dissenting); Trop v. Dulles, <citedDecision>356 U. S. 86, 100-101</citedDecision> (1958) (plurality opinion).  In Weems the Court addressed the constitutionality of the Philippine punishment of cadena temporal for the crime of falsifying an official document.  That punishment included imprisonment for at least 12 years and one day, in chains, at hard and painful labor; the loss of many basic civil rights; and subjection to lifetime surveillance.  Although the Court acknowledged the possibility that “the cruelty of pain” may be present in the challenged punishment, 217 U. S., at 366 , it did not rely on that factor, for it rejected the proposition that the Eighth Amendment reaches only punishments that are “inhuman and barbarous, torture and the like.” Id., at 368 .  Rather, the Court focused on the lack of proportion between the crime and the offense: “Such penalties for such offenses amaze those who have formed their conception of the relation of a state to even its offending citizens from the practice *172 of the American commonwealths, and believe that it is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to offense.” Id., at 366-367 .  18 Later, in <citedDecision>Trop</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Dulles, supra,</citedDecision> the Court reviewed the constitutionality of the punishment of denationalization imposed upon a soldier who escaped from an Army stockade and became a deserter for one day. Although the concept of proportionality was not the basis of the holding, the plurality observed in dicta that “[fjines, imprisonment and even execution may be imposed depending upon the enormity of the crime.” <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 100</citedDecision> .  .  The substantive limits imposed by the Eighth Amendment on what can be made criminal and punished were discussed in Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962).  The Court found unconstitutional a state statute that made the status of being addicted to a narcotic drug a criminal offense.  It held, in effect, that it is “cruel and unusual” to impose any punishment at all for the mere status of addiction.  The cruelty in the abstract of the actual sentence imposed was irrelevant: “Even one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the 'crime' of having a common cold.” Id., at 667 .  Most recently, in Furman v. Georgia, supra, three Justices in separate concurring opinions found the Eighth Amendment applicable to procedures employed to select convicted defendants for the sentence of death.  It is clear from the foregoing precedents that the *173 Eighth Amendment has not been regarded as a static concept.  As Mr. Chief Justice Warren said, in an oft-quoted phrase, “[t]he Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” <citedDecision>Trop</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Dulles, supra, at 101</citedDecision> .  See also Jackson v. Bishop, 404 P. 2d 571 , 579 (CA8 1968).  Cf. Robinson v. California, supra, at 666 .  Thus, an assessment of contemporary values concerning the infliction of a challenged sanction is relevant to the application of the Eighth Amendment.  As we develop below more fully, see infra, at 175-176, this assessment does not call for a subjective judgment.  It requires, rather, that we look to objective indicia that reflect the public attitude toward a given sanction.  But our cases also make clear that public perceptions of standards of decency with respect to criminal sanctions are not conclusive.  A penalty also must accord with “the dignity of man,” which is the “basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment.” <citedDecision>Trop</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Dulles, supra, at 100</citedDecision> (plurality opinion).  This means, at least, that the punishment not be “excessive.” When a form of punishment in the abstract (in this case, whether capital punishment may ever be imposed as a sanction for murder) rather than in the particular (the propriety of death as a penalty to be applied to a specific defendant for a specific crime) is under consideration, the inquiry into “excessiveness” has two aspects.  First, the punishment must not involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.  Furman v. Georgia, supra, at 392-393 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).  See Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S., at 136 ; Weems v. United States, supra, at 381 .  Second, the punishment must not be grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.  <citedDecision>Trop</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Dulles, supra, at 100</citedDecision> (plurality opinion) (dictum); Weems v. United States, supra, at 367 .  *174 B Of course, the requirements of the Eighth Amendment must be applied with an awareness of the limited role to be played by the courts.  This does not mean that judges have no role to play, for the Eighth Amendment is a restraint upon the exercise of legislative power.  “Judicial review, by definition, often involves a conflict between judicial and legislative judgment as to what the Constitution means or requires.  In this respect, Eighth Amendment cases come to us in no different posture.  It seems conceded by all that the Amendment imposes some obligations on the judiciary to judge the constitutionality of punishment and that there are punishments that the Amendment would bar whether legislatively approved or not.” Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 313-314 (White, J., concurring).  See also id., at 433 (Powell, J., dissenting).

 20 Therefore, in assessing a punishment selected by a democratically elected legislature against the constitutional measure, we presume its validity.  We may not require the legislature to select the least severe penalty possible so long as the penalty selected is not cruelly inhumane or disproportionate to the crime involved.  And a heavy burden rests on those who would attack the judgment of the representatives of the people.  This is true in part because the constitutional test is intertwined with an assessment of contemporary standards and the legislative judgment weighs heavily in ascertaining such standards.  “[I]n a democratic society legislatures, not courts, are constituted to respond to the will and consequently the moral values of the people.” *176 Furman v. Georgia, supra, at 383 (Burger, C. J., dissenting) .  The deference we owe to the decisions of the state legislatures under our federal system, 408 U. S., at 465-470 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), is enhanced where the specification of punishments is concerned, for “these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.” Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 393 (1958).  Cf. Robinson v. California, 370 U. S., at 664-665 ; <citedDecision>Trop</citedDecision> v. Dulles, <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 103</citedDecision> (plurality opinion); In re Kemmler, 136 U. S., at 447 .  Caution is necessary lest this Court become, “under the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the ultimate arbiter of the standards of criminal responsibility .  .  .  throughout the country.” Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 533 (1968) (plurality opinion).  A decision that a given punishment is impermissible under the Eighth Amendment cannot be reversed short of a constitutional amendment.  The ability of the people to express their preference through the normal democratic processes, as well as through ballot referenda, is shut off.

 .  .  nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law .  .  .  And the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted over three-quarters of a century later, similarly contemplates the existence of the capital sanction in providing that no State shall deprive any person of “life, liberty, or property” without due process of law. For nearly two centuries, this Court, repeatedly and *178 often expressly, has recognized that capital punishment is not invalid per se. In Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S., at 134-135 , where the Court found no constitutional violation in inflicting death by public shooting, it said: “Cruel and unusual punishments are forbidden by the Constitution, but the authorities referred to are quite sufficient to show that the punishment of shooting as a mode of executing the death penalty for the crime of murder in the first degree is not included in that category, within the meaning of the eighth amendment.” Rejecting the contention that death by electrocution was “cruel and unusual,” the Court in In re Kemmler, supra, at 447 , reiterated: “[T]he punishment of death is not cruel, within the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution.  It implies there something inhuman and barbarous, something more than the mere extinguishment of life.” Again, in Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S., at 464 , the Court remarked: “The cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted man is cruelty inherent in the method of punishment, not the necessary suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely.” And in <citedDecision>Trop</citedDecision> v. Dulles, <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 99</citedDecision> , Mr. Chief Justice Warren, for himself and three other Justices, wrote: “Whatever the arguments may be against capital punishment, both on moral grounds and in terms of accomplishing the purposes of punishment .  .  .  the death penalty has been employed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is still widely accepted, it cannot be said to violate the constitutional concept of cruelty.” *179 Four years ago, the petitioners in Furman and its companion cases predicated their argument primarily upon the asserted proposition that standards of decency had evolved to the point where capital punishment no longer could be tolerated.  The petitioners in those cases said, in effect, that the evolutionary process had come to an end, and that standards of decency required that the Eighth Amendment be construed finally as prohibiting capital punishment for any crime regardless of its depravity and impact on society.  This view was accepted by two Justices.  21 Three other Justices were unwilling to go so far; focusing on the procedures by which convicted defendants were selected for the death penalty rather than on the actual punishment inflicted, they joined in the conclusion that the statutes before the Court were constitutionally invalid.

 The Court has said that “one of the most important functions any jury can perform in making ... a selection [between life imprisonment and death for a defendant convicted in a capital case] is to maintain a link between contemporary community values and the penal system.” Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 , 519 n. 15 (1968).  It may be true that evolving standards have influenced juries in *182 recent decades to be more discriminating in imposing the sentence of death.  26 But the relative infrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death sentence does not indicate rejection of capital punishment per se. Rather, the reluctance of juries in many cases to impose the sentence may well reflect the humane feeling that this most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a small number of extreme cases. See Furman v. Georgia, supra, at 388 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).  Indeed, the actions of juries in many States since Furman are fully compatible with the legislative judgments, reflected in the new statutes, as to the continued utility and necessity of capital punishment in appropriate cases. At the close of 1974 at least 254 persons had been sentenced to death since Furman, 27 and by the end of March 1976, more than 460 persons were subject to death sentences.  As we have seen, however, the Eighth Amendment demands more than that a challenged punishment be acceptable to contemporary society.  The Court also must ask whether it comports with the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the Amendment.  <citedDecision>Trop</citedDecision> v. Dulles, <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 100</citedDecision> (plurality opinion).  Although we cannot “invalidate a category of penalties because we deem less severe penalties adequate to serve the ends of *183 penology,’ Furman v. Georgia, supra, at 451 (Powell, J., dissenting), the sanction imposed cannot be so totally without penological justification that it results in the gratuitous infliction of suffering.  Cf. Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S., at 135-136 ; In re Kemmler, 136 U. S., at 447 .  The death penalty is said to serve two principal social purposes: retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders.  28 In part, capital punishment is an expression of society’s moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct.  29 This function may be unappealing to many, but it is essential in an ordered society that asks its citizens to rely on legal processes rather than self-help to vindicate their wrongs.  “The instinct for retribution is part of the nature of man, and channeling that instinct in the administration of criminal justice serves an important purpose in promoting the stability of a society governed by law. When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they ‘deserve,’ then there are sown the seeds of anarchy — of self-help, vigilante justice, and lynch law.” Furman v. Georgia, supra, at 308 (Stewart, J., concurring).

 The Supreme Court of Georgia, in Arnold v. State, 236 Ga. 534, 540 , 224 S. E. 2d 386, 391 (1976), recently held unconstitutional the portion of the first circumstance encompassing persons who have a “substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions” because it did not set “sufficiently 'clear and objective standards.’” The statute requires that the Supreme Court of Georgia obtain and preserve the records of all capital felony cases in which the death penalty was imposed after January 1, 1970, or such earlier date that the court- considers appropriate.  § 27-2537 (f) (Supp. 1975).  To aid the court in its disposition of these cases the statute further provides for the appointment of a special assistant and authorizes the employment of additional staff members.  §§ 27-2537 (f)-(h) (Supp. 1975).  See Ga. Const., Art. 5, §1, ¶12, Ga. Code Ann. §2-3011 (1973); Ga. Code Ann. §§77-501 , 77-511, 77-513 (1973 and Supp. 1975) (Board of Pardons and Paroles is authorized to commute sentence of death except in eases where Governor refuses to suspend that sentence).  Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459, 464 (1947); In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890); Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 134-135 (1879).  See also McGautha v. California, 402 U. S. 183 (1971); Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968); Trop v. Dulles, <citedDecision>356 U. S. 86, 100</citedDecision> (1958) (plurality opinion).  408 U. S., at 375 (Burger, C.

Since five Justices wrote separately in support of the judgments in Furman , the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds — Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice White.  See n. 36, infra.  408 U. S., at 316-328 (Marshall, J., concurring).

 .  that the selection process has followed no rational pattern.” Id., at 398-399 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure require as a matter of course that a presentence report containing information about a defendant’s background be prepared for use by the sentencing judge. Rule 32(c).  The importance of obtaining accurate sentencing information is underscored by the Rule’s direction to the sentencing court to “afford the defendant or his counsel an opportunity to comment [on the report] and, at the discretion of the court, to introduce testimony or other information relating to any alleged factual inaccuracy contained in the presentence report.” Rule 32 (c) (3) (A).  Indeed, we hold elsewhere today that in capital cases it is constitutionally required that the sentencing authority have information *190 sufficient to enable it to consider the character and individual circumstances of a defendant prior to imposition of a death sentence.  See Woodson v. North Carolina, post, at 303-305.  Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S., at 519 n. 15, quoting <citedDecision>Trop</citedDecision> v. Dulles, <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 101</citedDecision> (plurality opinion).  See also Report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, 1949-1953, Cmd.  8932, ¶ 571.  In other situations this Court has concluded that a jury cannot be expected to consider certain evidence before it on one issue, but not another.  See, e. g., Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968); Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964).  In United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570 (1968), the Court considered a statute that provided that if a defendant pleaded guilty, the maximum penalty would be life imprisonment, but if a defendant chose to go to trial, the maximum penalty upon conviction was death.  In holding that the statute was constitutionally invalid, the Court noted: “The inevitable effect of any such provision is, of course, to discourage assertion of the Fifth Amendment right not to plead guilty and to deter exercise of the Sixth Amendment right to demand a jury trial. If the provision had no other purpose or effect than to chill the assertion of constitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to exercise them, then it would be patently unconstitutional.” Id., at 581 .

 Of course, it may be that these statements are intended as no more than observations as to the popular demands that it is thought must be responded to in order to prevent anarchy.  But the implication of the statements appears to me to be quite different — namely, that society’s judgment that the murderer “deserves” death must be respected not simply because the preservation of order requires it, but because it is appropriate that society make the judgment and carry it out.  It is this latter notion, in particular, that I consider to be fundamentally at odds with the Eighth Amendment.  See Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 343-345 (Marshall, J., concurring).  The mere fact that the community demands the murderer’s life in return for the evil he has done cannot sustain the death penalty, for as Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens remind us, “the Eighth Amendment demands more than that a challenged punishment be acceptable to contemporary society.” Ante, at 182.  To be sustained under the Eighth Amendment, the death penalty must “eompor[t] with the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the Amendment,” ibid.; the objective in imposing it must be “[consistent] with our respect for the dignity of [other] men.” Ante, at 183.  See Trop v. Dulles, <citedDecision>356 U. S. 86, 100</citedDecision> (1958) (plurality opinion).  Under these standards, the taking of life “because the wrongdoer deserves it” surely must *241 fall, for such a punishment has as its very basis the total denial of the wrongdoer’s dignity and worth.  19 The death penalty, unnecessary to promote the goal of deterrence or to further any legitimate notion of retribution, is an excessive penalty forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  I respectfully dissent from the Court’s judgment upholding the sentences of death imposed upon the petitioners in these cases. [This opinion applies also to No. 75-5706, Proffitt v.
