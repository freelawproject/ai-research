 The Court today, in its 5-4 decision, overrules National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), a case in which we held that Congress lacked authority to impose the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act on state and local governments.  Because I believe this decision substantially alters the federal system embodied in the Constitution, I dissent.  I There are, of course, numerous examples over the history of this Court in which prior decisions have been reconsidered and overruled.  There have been few cases, however, in which the principle of stare decisis and the rationale of recent *558 decisions were ignored as abruptly as we now witness.  1 The reasoning of the Court in National League of Cities , and the principle applied there, have been reiterated consistently over the past eight years.  Since its decision in 1976, National League of Cities has been cited and quoted in opinions joined by every Member of the present Court. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 287-293 (1981); Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., <citedDecision>455 U. S. 678, 684-686</citedDecision> (1982); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 764-767 (1982).  Less than three years ago, in Long Island R. Co., supra, a unanimous Court reaffirmed the principles of National League of Cities but found them inapplicable to the regulation of a railroad heavily engaged in interstate commerce.  The Court stated: “The key prong of the National League of Cities test applicable to this case is the third one [repeated and reformulated in Hodel], which examines whether ‘the States’ compliance with the federal law would directly impair their ability “to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.”’” <citedDecision>455 U. S., at 684</citedDecision> .  The Court in that case recognized that the test “may at times be a difficult one,” ibid., but it was considered in that unanimous decision as settled constitutional doctrine.  As recently as June 1, 1982, the five Justices who constitute the majority in these cases also were the majority in FERC v. Mississippi .  In that case, the Court said: “In National League of Cities v. Usery, supra, for example, the Court made clear that the State’s regulation of its relationship with its employees is an ‘undoubted attribute of state sovereignty.’ 426 U. S., at 845 .  Yet, *559 by holding ‘unimpaired’ California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), which upheld a federal labor regulation as applied to state railroad employees, 426 U. S., at 854, n. 18 , National League of Cities acknowledged that not all aspects of a State’s sovereign authority are immune from federal control.” 456 U. S., at 764, n. 28 .  The Court went on to say that ev-en~where the requirements of the National League of Cities standard are met, “‘[t]here are situations in which the nature of the federal interest advanced may be such that it justifies state submission.’” Ibid., quoting Hodel, supra, at 288, n. 29 .  The joint federal/state system of regulation in FERC was such a “situation,” but there was no hint in the Court’s opinion that National League of Cities — or its basic standard — was subject to the infirmities discovered today.

 This Court has recognized repeatedly that state sovereignty is a fundamental component of our system of government.  More than a century ago, in Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 (1869), the Court stated that the Constitution recognized “the necessary existence of the States, and, within their proper spheres, the independent authority of the States.” It concluded, as Madison did, that this authority extended to “nearly the whole charge of interior regulation .  .  .  ; to [the States] and to the people all powers not expressly delegated to the national government are reserved.” Id., at 76 .  Recently, in Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U. S. 40, 53 (1982), the Court recognized that the state action exemption from the antitrust laws was based on state sovereignty.  Similarly, in <citedDecision>Transportation Union</citedDecision> v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S., at 683, although finding the Railway Labor Act applicable to a state-owned railroad, the *574 unanimous Court was careful to say that the States possess constitutionally preserved sovereign powers.  Again, in FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 752 (1982), in determining the constitutionality of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, the Court explicitly considered whether the Act impinged on state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  These represent only a few of the many cases in which the Court has recognized not only the role, but also the importance, of state sovereignty.  See also, e. g., Fry v. United States, supra; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514 (1926); Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  As Justice Frankfurter noted, the States are not merely a factor in the “shifting economic arrangements” of our country, Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 95 (1949) (concurring), but also constitute a “coordinate element in the system established by the Framers for governing our Federal Union.” National League of Cities, supra, at 849.  D In contrast, the Court today propounds a view of federalism that pays only lipservice to the role of the States.  Although it says that the States “unquestionably do 'retai[n] a significant measure of sovereign authority,’” ante, at 549 (quoting EEOC v. Wyoming, supra, at 269 (Powell, J., dissenting)), it fails to recognize the broad, yet specific areas of sovereignty that the Framers intended the States to retain.

 Although the Court’s opinion in Wirtz was comparatively narrow, Justice Douglas, in dissent, wrote presciently that the Court’s reading of the Commerce Clause would enable “the National Government [to] devour the essentials of state sovereignty, though that sovereignty is attested by the Tenth Amendment.” 392 U. S., at 205 .  Today’s decision makes Justice Douglas’ fear once again a realistic one.  As I view the Court’s decision today as rejecting the basic precepts of our federal system and limiting the constitutional role of judicial review, I dissent.  National League of Cities , following some changes in the composition of the Court, had overruled Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968).  Unlike National League of Cities , the rationale of Wirtz had not been repeatedly accepted by our subsequent decisions.  Justice O’Connor, the only new Member of the Court since our decision in National League of Cities , has joined the Court in reaffirming its principles.  See Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., <citedDecision>455 U. S. 678</citedDecision> (1982), and FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775 (1982) (O’Connor, J., dissenting in part).  As one commentator noted, stare decisis represents “a natural evolution from the very nature of our institutions.” Lile, Some Views on the Rule of Stare Decisis, 4 Va. L. Rev. 95 , 97 (1916).  In National League of Cities , we referred to the sphere of state sovereignty as including “traditional governmental functions,” a realm which is, of course, difficult to define with precision.  But the luxury of precise definitions is one rarely enjoyed in interpreting and applying the general provisions of our Constitution.  Not surprisingly, therefore, the Court’s attempt to demonstrate the impossibility of definition is unhelpful.  A number of the cases it cites simply do not involve the problem of defining governmental functions.  E. g., Williams v. Eastside Mental Health Center, Inc., 669 F. 2d 671 (CA11), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 976 (1982); Friends of the Earth v. Carey, 552 F. 2d 25 (CA2), cert. denied, 434 U. S. 902 (1977).

 In the cited cases, however, the courts considered the issue of state immunity on the specific facts at issue; they did not make blanket pronouncements that particular things inherently qualified as traditional governmental functions or did not.  Having thus considered the cases out of context, it was not difficult for the Court to conclude that there is no “organizing principle” among them.  See ante, at 539.  In undertaking such balancing, we have considered, on the one hand, the strength of the federal interest in the challenged legislation and the impact of exempting the States from its reach.  Central to our inquiry into the federal interest is how closely the challenged action implicates the central concerns of the Commerce Clause, viz., the promotion of a national economy and free trade among the States.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 244 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring).  See also, for example, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., <citedDecision>455 U. S. 678, 688</citedDecision> (1982) (“Congress long ago concluded that federal regulation of railroad labor services is necessary to prevent disruptions in vital rail service essential to the national economy”); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 757 (1982) (“[I]t is difficult to conceive of a more basic element of interstate commerce than electric energy .  .  .  ”).  Similarly, we have considered whether exempting States from federal regulation would undermine the goals of the federal program.  See Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975).  See also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.
