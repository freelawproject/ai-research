 On appeal to the newly created Maryland Court of Special Appeals, petitioner’s double jeopardy claim was rejected on the merits.  1 Md. App. 647 , 232 A. 2d.  541 (1967).  The Court of Appeals denied discretionary review.  On the last day of last Term, we granted certiorari, 392 U. S. 925 (1968), but limited the writ to the consideration of two issues: *787 After oral argument, it became clear that the existence of a concurrent sentence on the burglary count might prevent the Court from reaching the double jeopardy issue, at least if we found that any error affected only petitioner’s larceny conviction.  Therefore, we scheduled the case for reargument, 393 U. S. 994 (1968), limited to the following additional question not included in the original writ: *786 “(1) Is the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment?  “(2) If so, was the petitioner ‘twice put in jeopardy’ in this case?” *787 “Does the ‘concurrent sentence doctrine,’ enunciated in Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 105 , and subsequent cases, have continuing validity in light of such decisions as Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 633, n. 2 , Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 , Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 237-238 , and Sibron v. New York, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 40</citedDecision> , 50-58?” The Solicitor General was invited to file a brief expressing the views of the United States and to participate in oral argument.  After consideration of all the questions before us, we find no bar to our decision of the double jeopardy issue.  On the merits, we hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, and we reverse petitioner’s conviction for larceny.  I.  At the outset of this case we are confronted with a jurisdictional problem.  If the error specified in the original writ of certiorari were found to affect only petitioner’s larceny conviction, 2 reversal of that conviction would not require the State to change the terms of *788 petitioner’s confinement.  Whatever the status of his sentence on the larceny conviction, petitioner would probably stay in prison until he had served out his sentence for burglary.

 And on at least one occasion, the Court has ignored the rule entirely and decided an issue that affected only one count, even though there were concurrent sentences.  Putnam v. United States, 162 U. S. 687 (1896).  One can search through these cases, and related ones, without finding any satisfactory explanation for the concurrent sentence doctrine.  See United States v. Hines, 256 F. 2d 561, 562-563 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1958).  But whatever the underlying justifications for the doc *790 trine, it seems clear to us that it cannot be taken to state a jurisdictional rule.  See Yates v. United States, 355 U. S. 66, 75-76 (1957); Putnam v. United States, supra. Moreover, whatever may have been the approach in the past, our recent decisions on the question of mootness in criminal cases make it perfectly clear that the existence of concurrent sentences does not remove the elements necessary to create a justiciable case or controversy.  In Sibron v. New York, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 40</citedDecision> (1968), we held that a criminal case did not become moot upon the expiration of the sentence imposed.  We noted “the obvious fact of life that most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal consequences.” <citedDecision>Id., at 55</citedDecision> .  We concluded that the mere possibility of such collateral consequences was enough to give the case the “impact of actuality” which was necessary to make it a justiciable case or controversy.  <citedDecision>Sibron</citedDecision> and a number of other recent cases have canvassed the possible adverse collateral effects of criminal convictions, 5 and we need not repeat that analysis here.  It is enough to say that there are such possibilities in this case. For example, there are a few States which consider all prior felony convictions for the purpose of enhancing sentence under habitual criminal statutes, even if the convictions actually constituted only separate counts in a single indictment tried on the same day. 6 Petitioner might some day in one of these States have both his larceny and burglary convictions counted against him.  Although this possibility *791 may well be a remote one, it is enough to give this case an adversary cast and make it justiciable.  Moreover, as in <citedDecision>Sibron</citedDecision> , both of petitioner’s convictions might some day be used to impeach his character if put in issue at a future trial. Although petitioner could explain that both convictions arose out of the same transaction, a jury might not be able to appreciate this subtlety.  We cannot, therefore, say that this Court lacks jurisdiction to decide petitioner’s challenge to his larceny conviction.  It may be that in certain circumstances a federal appellate court, as a matter of discretion, might decide (as in Hirabayashi) that it is “unnecessary” to consider all the allegations made by a particular party.  7 The concurrent sentence rule may have some continuing validity as a rule of judicial convenience.  That is not a subject we must canvass today, however.  It is sufficient for present purposes to hold that there is no jurisdictional bar to consideration of challenges to multiple convictions, even though concurrent sentences were imposed.  II.  While Maryland apparently agrees that there is no jurisdictional bar to consideration of petitioner’s larceny conviction, it argues that the possibility of collateral consequences is so remote in this case that any double jeopardy violation should be treated as a species of “harmless error.” The Solicitor General, while not commenting at length on the facts of this particular case, *792 suggests that we treat the concurrent sentence doctrine as a principle of judicial efficiency which permits judges to avoid decision of issues which have no appreciable impact on the rights of any party.  Both Maryland and the Solicitor General argue that the defendant should bear the burden of convincing the appellate court of the need to review all his concurrent sentences.  Petitioner, on the other hand, sees in <citedDecision>Sibron</citedDecision> a command that federal appellate courts treat all errors which may possibly affect a defendant’s rights, and he argues that the concurrent sentence rule therefore has no continuing validity, even as a rule of convenience.  Because of the special circumstances in this case, we find it unnecessary to resolve this dispute.  For even if the concurrent sentence doctrine survives as a rule of judicial convenience, we find good reason not to apply it here.  On direct appeal from petitioner’s conviction, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals did in fact rule on his double jeopardy challenge to the larceny count.  1 Md. App., at 650-651 , 232 A. 2d, at 542-543 .  It is unclear whether Maryland courts always consider all challenges raised on direct appeal, notwithstanding the existence of concurrent sentences, 8 but at least in this case the State decided not to apply the concurrent sentence rule.  This may well indicate that the State has some interest in keeping the larceny conviction alive; 9 if, as Maryland argues here, the larceny conviction is of no importance to either party, one wonders why the state courts found it necessary to pass on it.  Since the future importance of the conviction may well turn on issues of state law about which we are not well informed, we propose, on direct appeal from the Maryland courts, to accept their judgment on this question.  Since *793 they decided this federal constitutional question, we see no reason why we should not do so as well.  Moreover, the status of petitioner’s burglary conviction and the eventual length of his sentence are both still in some doubt.  10 Should any attack on the burglary conviction be successful, or should the length of the burglary sentence be reduced to less than five years, petitioner would then clearly have a right to have his larceny conviction reviewed.  As we said in <citedDecision>Sibron</citedDecision> v. New York, supra, at 56-57, it is certainly preferable to have that review now on direct appeal, rather than later.  11 For these reasons, and because there is no jurisdictional bar, we find it appropriate to reach the questions specified in our original writ of certiorari.  III. In 1937, this Court decided the landmark case of Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 .  Palko, although indicted for first-degree murder, had been convicted of murder in the second degree after a jury trial in a Connecticut state court. The State appealed and won a new trial. Palko argued that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated, as against the States, the Fifth Amendment requirement that no person “be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” The Court disagreed.  Federal double jeopardy standards were not applicable against the States.  Only when a kind of jeopardy subjected a defendant to “a hardship so acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it,” id., at 328 , did the Fourteenth Amendment apply.  The order *794 for a new trial was affirmed.

 A federal district court ordered the State to resentence petitioner, Benton v. Copinger, 291 F. Supp. 141 (D. C. Md. 1968), and an appeal brought by the State is presently pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  See Part V, infra.  Of course, if the error infected both counts upon which petitioner was convicted, there would be no concurrent sentence problem at all. We do not, however, resolve the question of whether the burglary conviction was “tainted.” The length of that sentence is presently a matter in dispute, see n. 1, supra. Grant v. Astle, 2 Doug. 722 , 99 Eng. Rep. 459 (1781); Peake v. Oldham, 1 Cowp. 275, 98 Eng. Rep. 1083 (1775); Rex v. Benfield, 2 Burr. 980, 97 Eng. Rep. 664 (1760).  Street v. New York, 394 U. S. 576, 579-580, n. 3 (1969); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 237-238 (1968); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 633-634, n. 2 (1968).  The majority rule is, apparently, that all convictions handed down at the same time count as a single conviction for the purpose of habitual offender statutes, but a few States follow the stricter rule described in the text.  The relevant cases are collected at 24 A. L. R. 2d 1262-1267 (1952), and in the accompanying supplements.  In <citedDecision>Sibron</citedDecision> we noted the inadequacies of a procedure which postpones appellate review until it is proposed to subject the convicted person to collateral consequences.  392 U. S., at 56-57.  For the reasons there stated, an attempt to impose collateral consequences after an initial refusal to review a conviction on direct appeal because of the concurrent sentence doctrine may well raise some constitutional problems.  That issue is not, however, presented by this case, and accordingly we express no opinion on it.  Compare Meade v. State, 198 Md. 489 , 84 A. 2d 892 (1951), with Marks v. State, 230 Md. 108 , 185 A. 2d 909 (1962).  See n. 7, supra. See n. 1, supra, and Part V, infra.  A stronger ease for total abolition of the concurrent sentence doctrine may well be made in cases on direct appeal, as compared to convictions attacked collaterally by suits for post-conviction relief.
