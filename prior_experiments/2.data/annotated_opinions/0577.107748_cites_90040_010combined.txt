. to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.' " 334 U. S., at 34 . That result, this Court concluded, was prohibited by *419 § 1982. To suggest otherwise, the Court said, "is to reject the plain meaning of language." Ibid. Hurd v. Hodge, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , squarely held, therefore, that a Negro citizen who is denied the opportunity to purchase the home he wants "[s]olely because of [his] race and color," 334 U. S., at 34 , has suffered the kind of injury that § 1982 was designed to prevent. Accord, Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60 , 79; Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 ; Richmond v. Deans, 281 U. S. 704 . The basic source of the injury in Hurd was, of course, the action of private individualswhite citizens who had agreed to exclude Negroes from a residential area. But an arm of the Governmentin that case, a federal courthad assisted in the enforcement of that agreement. [24] Thus Hurd v. Hodge, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , did not present the question whether purely private discrimination, unaided by any action on the part of government, would violate § 1982 if its effect were to deny a citizen the right to rent or buy property solely because of his race or color. The only federal court (other than the Court of Appeals in this case) that has ever squarely confronted that question held that a wholly private conspiracy among white citizens to prevent a Negro from leasing a farm violated § 1982. United States v. Morris, 125 F. 322 . It is true that a dictum in Hurd said that § 1982 was directed only toward "governmental action," 334 U. S., at 31 , but neither Hurd nor any other case *420 before or since has presented that precise issue for adjudication in this Court. [25] Today we face that issue for the first time. III. We begin with the language of the statute itself.

Court of Appeals another hearing," Magnum Co. v. Coty, 262 U. S. 159 , 163, or "for the benefit of the particular litigants," Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, 349 U. S. 70 , 74, but to decide issues, "the settlement of which is of importance to the public as distinguished from . . . the parties," Layne & Bowler Corp. v. Western Well Works, Inc., 261 U. S. 387 , 393. I deem it far more important that this Court should avoid, if possible, the decision of constitutional and unusually difficult statutory questions than that we fulfill the expectations of every litigant who appears before us. One prior decision of this Court especially suggests dismissal of the writ as the proper course in these unusual circumstances. In Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , the issue was whether a privately owned cemetery might defend a suit for breach of a contract to bury on the ground that the decedent was a Winnebago Indian and the contract restricted burial privileges to Caucasians. In considering a petition for rehearing following an initial affirmance by an equally divided Court, there came to the Court's attention for the first time an Iowa statute which prohibited cemeteries from discriminating on account of race, but which would not have benefited the Rice petitioner because of an exception for "pending litigation." Mr. Justice Frankfurter, speaking for a majority of the Court, held that the writ should be dismissed. He pointed out that the case presented "evident difficulties," 349 U. S., at 77, and noted that "[h]ad the statute been properly brought to our attention . . . , the case would have assumed such an isolated significance that it would hardly have been brought here in the first instance."

Nor do we intimate any view upon the extent to which discrimination in the provision of such services might be barred by 42 U. S. C. § 1981 , the text of which appears in n. 78, infra.

[22] 82 U. S. App. D. C. 180, 162 F. 2d 233 . [23] 332 U. S. 789 . [24] Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 , invalidating a New Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community, or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, "except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected." See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1 , 12. [25] Two of this Court's early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action. Virginia v. Rives, <targetCase>100 U. S. 313</targetCase> , 317-318; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17. But all that <targetCase>Virginia</targetCase> v. Rives, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322. See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780 , 797-804. And of course the Civil Rights Cases, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 335 , did not involve the present statute at all. It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24 , 31, characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , as having "held" that "[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute . . . [are] directed is governmental action." 334 U. S., at 31.

[54] Id., at 599. (Emphasis added.) Senator Trumbull later observed that his bill would add nothing to federal authority if the States would fully "perform their constitutional obligations." Id., at 600. See also Senator Trumbull's remarks, id., at 1758; the remarks of Senator Lane of Indiana, id., at 602-603; and the remarks of Congressman Wilson of Iowa, id., at 1117-1118. But it would be a serious mistake to infer from such statements any notion (see the dissenting opinion, post, at 460) that, so long as the States refrained from actively discriminating against Negroes, their "obligations" in this area, as Senator Trumbull and others understood them, would have been fulfilled. For the Senator's concern, it will be recalled (see text accompanying n. 49, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> ), was that Negroes might be "oppressed and in fact deprived of their freedom" not only by hostile laws but also by "prevailing public sentiment," and he viewed his bill as necessary "unless by local legislation they [the States] provide for the real freedom of their former slaves." Id., at 77. See also id., at 43. And see the remarks of Congressman Lawrence of Ohio: "Now, there are two ways in which a State may undertake to deprive citizens of these absolute, inherent, and inalienable rights: either by prohibitory laws, or by a failure to protect any one of them." Id., at 1833. [55] See, e. g., the remarks of Senator Howard of Michigan. Id., at 504.

[72] See United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383 , 387-388; United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787 , 804-805; 2 W. Fleming, Documentary History of Reconstruction 285-288 (1907); K. Stampp, supra, n. 34, at 145, 171, 185, 198-204; G. Stephenson, Race Distinctions in American Law 116 (1910). [73] The Court of Appeals in this case seems to have derived such an assumption from language in Virginia v. Rives, <targetCase>100 U. S. 313</targetCase> , 317-318, and Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24 , 31. See 379 F. 2d 33 , 39-40, 43. Both of those opinions simply asserted that, at least after its re-enactment in 1870, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was directed only at governmental action. Neither opinion explained why that was thought to be so, and in each case the statement was merely dictum. See n. 25, supra. [74] So it was, for example, that this Court unanimously upheld the power of Congress under the Thirteenth Amendment to make it a crime for one individual to compel another to work in order to discharge a debt.

Whatever the present validity of the position taken by the majority on that issuea question rendered largely academic by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243 (see Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 ; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 )we note that the entire Court agreed upon at least one proposition: The Thirteenth Amendment authorizes Congress not only to outlaw all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude but also to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of a society half slave and half free, by securing to all citizens, of every race and color, "the same right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens." 109 U. S., at 22 . Cf. id., at 35 (dissenting opinion). In Hodges v. United States, 203 U. S. 1 , a group of white men had terrorized several Negroes to prevent them from working in a sawmill. The terrorizers were convicted under 18 U. S. C. § 241 (then Revised Statutes § 5508) of conspiring to prevent the Negroes from exercising the right to contract for employment, a right secured by 42 U. S. C. § 1981 (then Revised Statutes § 1977, derived from § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, see n. 28, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> ). Section 1981 provides, in terms that closely parallel those of § 1982 (then Revised Statutes § 1978), that all persons in the United States "shall have the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens . . .

[1] This "state action" argument emphasizes the respondents' role as housing developers exercising continuing authority over a suburban housing complex with about 1,000 inhabitants. [2] The Civil Rights Act of 1968, Pub. L. 90-284, 82 Stat. 73 . [3] Id., §§ 801-819. [4] See ante, at 417, n. 21. [5] See also Virginia v. Rives, <targetCase>100 U. S. 313</targetCase> , 317-318.

[8] It seems to me that this passage is not dictum, as the Court terms it, ante, at 419 and n. 25, but a holding. For if the Court had held the covenants in question invalid as between the parties, then it would not have had to rely upon a finding of "state action." [9] Despite the Court's view that this reading flies in the face of the "plain and unambiguous terms" of the statute, see ante, at 420, it is not without precedent. In the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , the Court said of identical language in the predecessor statute to § 1982: "[C]ivil rights, such as are guaranteed by the Constitution against State aggression, cannot be impaired by the wrongful acts of individuals, unsupported by State authority .
