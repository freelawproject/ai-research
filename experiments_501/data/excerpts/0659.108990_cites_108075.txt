 Federal standards are designed to ensure that those needs are equitably met; and there may perhaps be cases in which the prompt payment of funds wrongfully withheld will serve that end.  As time goes by, however, retroactive payments become compensatory rather than remedial; the coincidence between previously ascertained and existing needs becomes less clear.” The Court of Appeals considered the Court’s decision in Griffin v. School Board, 377 U. S. 218 (1964), to be of like import.  But as may be seen from Griffin’s citation of Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529 (1890), a counts^ does not occupy the same position as a State for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.  See also Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973).  The fact that the county policies executed by the county officials in Griffin were subject to the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment, but the county was not able to invoke the protection of the Eleventh Amendment, is no more than a recognition of the long-established rule that while county action is generally state action for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, a county defendant is not necessarily a state defendant for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.  Brief for Respondent 15-18.  Decisions of this Court in which we summarily affirmed a decision of a lower federal court which ordered the payment of retroactive awards and in which the jurisdictional statement filed in this Court raised the Eleventh Amendment defense include: State Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Services v. Zarate, 407 U. S. 918 (1972), aff’g 347 F. Supp. 1004 (SD Fla. 1971); Sterrett v. Mothers’ and Children’s Rights Organization, 409 U. S. 809 (1972), aff’g unreported order and judgment of District Court (ND Ind. 1972) on remand from Carpenter v. Sterrett, 405 U. S. 971 (1972); Gaddis v. Wyman, 304 F. Supp. 717 (SDNY 1969) (order at CCH Poverty Law Rep. ¶ 10,506 [1968-1971 Transfer Binder]), aff’d per curiam sub nom. Wyman v. Bowens, <citedDecision>397 U. S. 49</citedDecision> (1970).  In the words of Mr. Justice Brandeis: “Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.  .  .  .  This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation.  But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.
