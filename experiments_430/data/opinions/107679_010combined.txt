  This case concerns the scope of <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. § 2241</span> (c)(3), which specifies that the United States District Courts may issue writs of habeas corpus on behalf of prisoners who are “in custody in violation of the Constitution . . . of the United States.” The question presented is whether a district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner incarcerated under consecutive sentences who claims that a sentence that he is scheduled to serve in the future is invalid because of a deprivation of rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The Court considered this issue in

  Respondents, Robert Rowe and Clyde Thacker, are serving prison terms in the Virginia State Penitentiary. In June 1963 Rowe was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment after a jury found him guilty of rape. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with felonious abduction with intent to defile arising from the same events which had led to the rape conviction.

  <a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">

  </a>
  Rowe petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. He did not attack the rape conviction, but alleged that the conviction for felonious abduction was constitutionally defective because he had been subjected to double jeopardy, because his plea of guilty had been involuntary, because the indictment had failed to state an offense and because he had been inadequately represented by trial counsel. Without reaching the merits of Rowe’s claims, the District Court denied relief. Applying McNally, the court found Rowe was then detained under the 30-year sentence for rape. Since he did not claim that sentence was invalid, it was held that he was not then “in custody” under an unconstitutionally imposed sentence within the meaning of § 2241. The court concluded that it could not entertain Rowe’s challenge to the conviction for felonious abduction until he was confined under the sentence imposed for that conviction. That time would not arrive until 1993.

  Thacker’s § 2241 petition in the Eastern District of Virginia met a similar fate. He is imprisoned under a number of sentences totaling more than 60 years. He asserted that three consecutive five-year sentences imposed for housebreaking in 1953 were invalid because of

  currently and the sentence on the third consecutively. In his application in a district court for a writ of habeas corpus, McNally claimed that the indictment failed to state an offense as to the third count. He did not attack the convictions under the first and second counts. When he filed his petition he was serving under the second count. The lower courts denied relief on the merits. But this Court affirmed on a jurisdictional ground, holding that because McNally had not begun to serve the sentence on the third count- — and therefore was not “in custody” under that sentence — his petition for relief was premature:
 </p>
<blockquote id="b107-5">
  “[WJithout restraint which is unlawful, the writ may not be used.

  The effect of this disposition was ameliorated somewhat by the Court’s suggestion that McNally might seek relief by another route.

Moreover, McNally’s challenge was directed at the face of the indictment. Therefore, postponement of adjudication of his claims probably would not have resulted in the loss of crucial evidence. But the harshness of a rule which may delay determination of federal claims for decades becomes obvious when applied to the cases of Rowe and Thacker. Their cases also exemplify the manner in which the decision in

Yet, under the current schedules of confinement, it is argued, neither Rowe nor Thacker may obtain adjudication of his claims until after 1990.

  in many instances extends without practical justification the time a prisoner entitled to release must remain in confinement. Rowe and Thacker eventually may establish that the convictions they challenge were obtained in violation of the Constitution. If they do, each day they are incarcerated under those convictions while their cases are in the courts will be time that they might properly have enjoyed as free men. Common sense dictates that prisoners seeking habeas corpus relief after exhausting state remedies should be able to do so at the earliest practicable time.

  The foregoing analysis demonstrates that

  is inconsistent with the purposes underlying the federal writ of habeas corpus. Moreover, in arriving at its decision, the Court in

   <span class="citation" data-id="102317"><a href="/opinion/102317/mcnally-v-hill/" aria-description="Citation for case: McNally v. Hill">McNally</a></span>
  </em>
  relied in part upon an unnecessarily narrow interpretation of the habeas corpus statute. Standing alone, the limitation of § 2241 (c) (3) — that “[t]he writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless ... [h]e is in custody in violation of the Constitution” — is not free of ambiguity. However, in common understanding “custody” comprehends respondents’ status for the entire duration of their imprisonment. Practically speaking, Rowe is in custody for 50 years, or for the aggregate of his 30- and 20-year sentences. For purposes of parole eligibility, under Virginia law he is incarcerated for 50 years. <span class="citation no-link">Va. Code Ann. § 53-251</span> (1967); see n. 3,
  <em>
   supra.
  </em>
  Nothing on the face of § 2241 militates against an interpretation which views Rowe and Thacker as being “in custody” under the aggregate of the consecutive sentences imposed on them. Under that interpretation, they are “in custody in violation of the Constitution” if any consecutive sentence they are scheduled to serve was imposed as the result-
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="65">

Meaningful factual hearings on alleged constitutional deprivations can be conducted before memories and records grow stale, and at least one class of prisoners will have the opportunity to challenge defective convictions and obtain relief without having to spend unwarranted months or years in prison.

  and was subsequently rejected. Both the historical and conceptual bases of the opinion are revealed in the Court’s observation that “[djiligent search of the English authorities and the digests before 1789 has failed to disclose any case where the writ was sought or used ... as a means of securing the judicial decision of any question which, even if determined in the prisoner’s favor, could

To the extent that the Court thought that the absence of eighteenth century English precedent demonstrated that McNally was not entitled to habeas corpus relief, the Court’s reliance seems to have been misplaced. In light of the fact that English judges had no power to impose cumulative punishment in felony cases,
