**Combined Opinion**
To provide the necessary security against unreasonable intrusions upon the private lives of *759 individuals, the framers of the Fourth Amendment required adherence to judicial processes wherever possible. And subsequent history has confirmed the wisdom of that requirement. ..... "A search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been considered to be a strictly limited right. It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest. But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest." Id., at 705, 708. In 1950, two years after Trupiano, [3] came United States v. Rabinowitz, <targetCase>339 U.S. 56</targetCase> , the decision upon which California primarily relies in the case now before us. In <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase>, federal authorities had been informed that the defendant was dealing in stamps bearing forged overprints. On the basis of that information they secured a warrant for his arrest, which they executed at his one-room business office. At the time of the arrest, the officers "searched the desk, safe, and file cabinets in the office for about an hour and a half," id., at 59, and seized 573 stamps with forged overprints. The stamps were admitted into evidence at the defendant's trial, and this Court affirmed his conviction, rejecting the contention that the warrantless search had been unlawful. The Court held that the search in its entirety fell within the principle giving law enforcement authorities "[t]he right `to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime . . . .' " Id., at 61. Harris was regarded as "ample authority" for that conclusion. Id., at 63. The opinion rejected the rule of Trupiano that "in seizing goods and articles, law enforcement agents must secure and use search warrants *760 wherever reasonably practicable." The test, said the Court, "is not whether it is reasonable to procure a search warrant, but whether the search was reasonable." Id., at 66.<targetCase> Rabinowitz</targetCase> has come to stand for the proposition, inter alia, that a warrantless search "incident to a lawful arrest" may generally extend to the area that is considered to be in the "possession" or under the "control" of the person arrested. [4] And it was on the basis of that proposition that the California courts upheld the search of the petitioner's entire house in this case. That doctrine, however, at least in the broad sense in which it was applied by the California courts in this case, can withstand neither historical nor rational analysis. Even limited to its own facts, the <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> decision was, as we have seen, hardly founded on an unimpeachable line of authority. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter commented in dissent in that case, the "hint" contained in Weeks was, without persuasive justification, "loosely turned into dictum and finally elevated to a decision." 339 U.S. , at 75 . And the approach taken in cases such as Go-Bart, Lefkowitz, and Trupiano was essentially disregarded by the <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> Court. Nor is the rationale by which the State seeks here to sustain the search of the petitioner's house supported by a reasoned view of the background and purpose of the Fourth Amendment. Mr. Justice Frankfurter wisely pointed out in his <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> dissent that the Amendment's proscription of "unreasonable searches and seizures" *761 must be read in light of "the history that gave rise to the words"a history of "abuses so deeply felt by the Colonies as to be one of the potent causes of the Revolution. . . ." 339 U.S. , at 69 . The Amendment was in large part a reaction to the general warrants and warrantless searches that had so alienated the colonists and had helped speed the movement for independence. [5] In the scheme of the Amendment, therefore, the requirement that "no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause," plays a crucial part.
**Combined Opinion**
Under such an unconfined analysis, Fourth Amendment protection in this area would approach the evaporation point. It is not easy to explain why, for instance, it is less subjectively "reasonable" to search a man's house when he is arrested on his front lawnor just down the streetthan it is when he happens to be in the house at the time of arrest. [10] As Mr. Justice Frankfurter put it: "To say that the search must be reasonable is to require some criterion of reason. It is no guide at all either for a jury or for district judges or the police to say that an `unreasonable search' is forbidden that the search must be reasonable. What is the test of reason which makes a search reasonable? The test is the reason underlying and expressed by the Fourth Amendment: the history and the experience which it embodies and the safeguards afforded by it against the evils to which it was a response." United States v. <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase>, 339 U. S., at 83 (dissenting opinion). Thus, although "[t]he recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches" depend upon "the facts and circumstances the total atmosphere of the case," id., at 63, 66 (opinion of the Court), those facts and circumstances must be viewed in the light of established Fourth Amendment principles. *766 It would be possible, of course, to draw a line between <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> and Harris on the one hand, and this case on the other. For <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> involved a single room, and Harris a four-room apartment, while in the case before us an entire house was searched. But such a distinction would be highly artificial. The rationale that allowed the searches and seizures in <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> and Harris would allow the searches and seizures in this case. No consideration relevant to the Fourth Amendment suggests any point of rational limitation, once the search is allowed to go beyond the area from which the person arrested might obtain weapons or evidentiary items. [11] The only reasoned distinction is one between a search of the person arrested and the area within his reach on the one hand, and more extensive searches on the other. [12] *767 The petitioner correctly points out that one result of decisions such as <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> and Harris is to give law enforcement officials the opportunity to engage in searches not justified by probable cause, by the simple expedient of arranging to arrest suspects at home rather than elsewhere. We do not suggest that the petitioner is necessarily correct in his assertion that such a strategy was utilized here, [13] but the fact remains that had he been arrested earlier in the day, at his place of employment rather than at home, no search of his house could have been made without a search warrant. In any event, even apart from the possibility of such police tactics, the general point so forcefully made by Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Kirschenblatt, 16 F.2d 202 , remains: "After arresting a man in his house, to rummage at will among his papers in search of whatever will convict him, appears to us to be indistinguishable from what might be done under a general warrant; indeed, the warrant would give more protection, for presumably it must be issued by a magistrate. True, by hypothesis the power would not exist, if the supposed offender were not found on the premises; *768 but it is small consolation to know that one's papers are safe only so long as one is not at home." Id., at 203.<targetCase> Rabinowitz</targetCase> and Harris have been the subject of critical commentary for many years, [14] and have been relied upon less and less in our own decisions. [15] It is time, for the reasons we have stated, to hold that on their own facts, and insofar as the principles they stand for are inconsistent with those that we have endorsed today, they are no longer to be followed. Application of sound Fourth Amendment principles to the facts of this case produces a clear result. The search here went far beyond the petitioner's person and the area from within which he might have obtained either a weapon or something that could have been used as evidence against him. There was no constitutional justification, in the absence of a search warrant, for extending the search beyond that area. The scope of the search was, therefore, "unreasonable" under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the petitioner's conviction cannot stand. [16] Reversed. *769 MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring. I join the Court's opinion with these remarks concerning a factor to which the Court has not alluded. The only thing that has given me pause in voting to overrule Harris and <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> is that as a result of Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), and Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23 (1963), every change in Fourth Amendment law must now be obeyed by state officials facing widely different problems of local law enforcement. We simply do not know the extent to which cities and towns across the Nation are prepared to administer the greatly expanded warrant system which will be required by today's decision; nor can we say with assurance that in each and every local situation, the warrant requirement plays an essential role in the protection of those fundamental liberties protected against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, one is now faced with the dilemma, envisioned in my separate opinion in Ker, 374 U. S., at 45-46, of choosing between vindicating sound Fourth Amendment principles at the possible expense of state concerns, long recognized to be consonant with the Fourteenth Amendment before Mapp and Ker came on the books, or diluting the Federal Bill of Rights in the interest of leaving the States at least some elbow room in their methods of criminal law enforcement. No comparable dilemma exists, of course, with respect to the impact of today's decision within the federal system itself. This federal-state factor has not been an easy one for me to resolve, but in the last analysis I cannot in good conscience vote to perpetuate bad Fourth Amendment law. I add only that this case, together with Benton v. Maryland, post, p. 784, North Carolina v. Pearce, ante, p. 711, and Simpson v. Rice, ante, p. 711, all decided *770 today, serve to point up, as few other cases have, the profound changes that the "incorporation doctrine" has wrought both in the workings of our federal system and upon the adjudicative processes of this Court. MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, dissenting.

Accord, Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20 , 30 (1925) (holding that "the place where the arrest is made" may be searched "is not to be doubted"). The rule was reaffirmed in Marron v. United States, 275 U.S. 192 , 199 (1927), where the Court asserted that authority *771 to search incident to an arrest "extended to all parts of the premises used for the unlawful purpose." Within five years, this rule was qualified by two Prohibition Act cases, Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344 , 356-358 (1931), and United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U.S. 452 , 463-467 (1932). If Go-Bart and Lefkowitz represented a retreat from the rule of Weeks, Carroll, Agnello, and Marron, the vigor of the earlier rule was reaffirmed in Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145 (1947), which has, but for one brief interlude, clearly been the law until today. The very next Term after Harris, in Trupiano v. United States, 334 U.S. 699 (1948), the Court held unjustifiable the seizure of a still incident to the arrest of a man at the still site, even though the still was contraband, had been visible through an open door before entering the premises to be "searched," and although a crime was being committed in the officers' presence. Accord, that year, McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451 (1948) (gambling game seen through transom before entry). Less than two years later, however, the Court returned to the Harris rule in United States v. Rabinowitz, <targetCase>339 U.S. 56</targetCase> (1950), where the Court held that the reasonableness of a search does not depend upon the practicability of obtaining a search warrant, and that the fact of a valid arrest is relevant to reasonableness. Trupiano was pro tanto overruled. Such rapid reversals have occurred before, [1] but they are rare. Here there had been two about-faces, one following hard upon the other. Justice Frankfurter objected in this language: "Especially ought the Court not reenforce needlessly the instabilities of our day by giving fair ground for the belief that Law is the expression of *772 chancefor instance, of unexpected changes in the Court's composition and the contingencies in the choice of successors." 339 U.S. , at 86 . Since that time, the rule of Weeks, Marron, Harris, and <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> has clearly been the law. E. g., Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., writing for the Court); Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23 (1963). [2] II. The rule which has prevailed, but for very brief or doubtful periods of aberration, is that a search incident to an arrest may extend to those areas under the control of the defendant and where items subject to constitutional seizure may be found. The justification for this rule must, under the language of the Fourth Amendment, lie in the reasonableness of the rule. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 , 9 (1968); Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968); Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206 , 222 (1960). The Amendment provides: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

NOTES [1] The affidavit supporting the warrant is set out in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, 61 Cal. Rptr. , at 715-716 , n. 1, and the State does not challenge its insufficiency under the principles of Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 , and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 . [2] The Court assumed that the arrests were lawful. 282 U.S. , at 356 . [3] See also McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451 . [4] Decisions of this Court since <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> have applied the abstract doctrine of that case to various factual situations with divergent results. Compare Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23 , 42; Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217 ; and Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307 , with Kremen v. United States, 353 U.S. 346 ( per curiam ). Cf. Chapman v. United States, 365 U.S. 610 ; Jones v. United States, 357 U.S. 493 , 499-500. [5] See generally Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 , 624-625; Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 , 389-391; Davis v. United States, 328 U.S. 582 , 603-605 (dissenting opinion); Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145 , 157-162 (dissenting opinion); Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476 , 481-482. [6] See also Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721 , 728; Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 , 356-358; Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 , 299; Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364 , 367. [7] Our Sibron opinion dealt with two cases. We refer here to No. 63, involving the appellant Sibron. See infra, at 764. [8] See Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 , 357-358. [9] Our holding today is of course entirely consistent with the recognized principle that, assuming the existence of probable cause, automobiles and other vehicles may be searched without warrants "where it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought." Carroil v. United States, 267 U.S. 132 , 153; see Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160 . [10] Some courts have carried the <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> approach to just such lengths. See, e. g., Clifton v. United States, 224 F.2d 329 (C. A. 4th Cir. ), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 894 (purchaser of illicit whiskey arrested in back yard of seller; search of one room of house sustained): United States v. Jackson, 149 F. Supp. 937 (D. C. D. C.), rev'd on other grounds, 102 U. S. App. D. C. 109, 250 F.2d 772 (suspect arrested half a block from his rented room; search of room upheld).

[1] Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943), overruled Jones v. Opelika, 316 U.S. 584 (1942); Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457 (1871), overruled Hepburn v. Griswold, 8 Wall. 603 (1870). [2] The majority cites Kremen v. United States, 353 U.S. 346 (1957), as suggesting an inconsistency. There, however, in a per curiam opinion the Court merely overturned a general search in which the entire contents of a cabin, which it took 11 pages of fine print for the Court to inventory, were seized. See Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217 , 239 (1960) ( Kremen distinguished as a "mass seizure"). [3] Even Mr. Justice Frankfurter, joined in dissent in <targetCase>Rabinowitz</targetCase> by Mr. Justice Jackson, admitted that there was an exception to the search-warrant requirement in cases of necessity, and noted that this applied, for example, to vehicles which could readily be moved. <targetCase>339 U.S. 56</targetCase> , at 73. [4] Before the burglary of the coin store, petitioner had told its owner that he was planning a big robbery, had inquired about the alarm system in the store, the state of the owner's insurance, and the location of the owner's most valuable coins. Petitioner wandered about the store the day before the burglary. After the burglary, petitioner called the store's owner and accused him of robbing the store himself for the insurance proceeds on a policy which, as petitioner knew, had just been reduced from $50,000 to $10,000 coverage. On being told that the robbery had been sloppy, petitioner excitedly claimed that it had been "real professional" but then denied the robbery. On the night of the robbery itself petitioner declined an invitation to a bicycle ride, saying he was "going to knock over a place" and that a coin shop was "all set." After the robbery, he told the same neighbor that he had started to break into the coin shop, but had stopped, and then denied the whole incident.
