495 , for example, provides that Indians of a class which includes the three deceased should select up to 160 acres of his allotted, inherited or devised restricted lands, which 'shall remain exempt from taxation while the title remains in the Indian designated * * * or in any full-blood Indian heir of devisee', while all other restricted lands are made subject to taxation by Oklahoma. The state argues that congressional exemption of the land from direct state taxation does not exempt the land from an estate tax, because of the principles announced in United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, supra. A majority of the Court concludes that this principle does not apply to Indian lands specifically exempted from direct taxation. We therefore hold that the transfer of those lands which Congress has exempted from direct taxation by the tate are also exempted from estate taxes. To summarize: 19 In No. 623, the transfer of the cash and securities is taxable, the transfer of the homestead and other allotted land, exempted under the Act of May 10, 1928, is not. The 43 acres purchased for the intestate from her restricted funds was taxable at the time of her death, Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U.S. 575 , 48 S.Ct. 333 , 72 L.Ed. 709 , and hence is subject to the estate tax. 20 In No. 624, the transfer of the cash and securities and the personal property is taxable. The deceased died before the Act of May 10, 1928, took effect, but her 240-acre holding was specifically exempt from direct taxation at the time of her death under § 19 of the Act of April 26, 1906, and the transfer of lands is therefore not taxable. 21 In No. 625, the same result as in No.

O'Keefe, 306 U.S. 466 , 59 S.Ct. 595 , 83 L.Ed. 927 , 120 A.L.R. 1466 , not upon a notion that Congress did not intend by imposing restrictions to prohibit state taxation of the interest of Indians in their restricted property, nor upon the supposition that Congress lacks power to do so. Congress plainly has power to implement its Indian policy by forbidding state taxation to burden the interest of an Indian in his property. Cf. Shaw v. Oil Corp., 276 U.S. 575 , 48 S.Ct. 333 , 72 L.Ed. 709 ; Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U.S. 705 , 63 S.Ct. 920 , 87 L.Ed. —-. It exercises that power simply by imposing the restrictions. 31 That Congress has considered the restriction of Indian property against alienation and encumbrance as carrying with it immunity from state taxation for the period of the restriction is clear not only from statements of Congress itself to that effect, 5 but also from the long history of such restrictions and the purpose sought to be achieved, the protection of a dependent people from their own improvidence and the exploitation of others. 32 Congress early established the complete and exclusive control of the Federal Government over the purchase and disposition of Indian lands, both tribal and individual.

616 , 20 L.Ed. 227 , and its creature, the Territorial government, was agitating for the taxation of Indian property. 15 Restrictions, designed to protect the Indians from themselves and the actions of third parties, including state governments, did not bar taxation by the federal government which was the guardian of their interests. 16 Accordingly, specific tax exemptions were written into the allotment acts. 17 Express provisions as to the taxable status of restricted property in the later legislation appear only where the immunity is being limited and expressly waived in part, or the restrictions are being changed. 18 38 All of the lands which the opinion of the Court holds immune from Oklahoma's estate tax because of express exemptions were therefore also exempt at the moment of death on the additional ground that they were then subject to restrictions imposed by Congress and the concomitant tax immunity had not been waived. The other restricted lands in the estates are lands to whose taxation Congress has specifically consented, or else were of the type to be taxable at the time of death under the decision in Shaw v. Oil Corp., 276 U.S. 575 , 48 S.Ct. 333 , 72 L.Ed. 709 . 39 The origin of restrictions upon the fund of members of the Five Civilized Tribes is somewhat different from that upon the lands, but the effect of the restrictions upon the taxability of the cash and securities in the three estates with which we are dealing is the same. Proceeds from sales or leases of restricted lands have always been regarded as 'trust' or 'restricted' funds by the Secretary of the Interior, who by regulations has required them to be paid to him or his representatives and held for the benefit of the Indian owner. 19 The validity of those administrative restrictions and the power of the United States to enforce them have been recognized. Parker v. Richard, 250 U.S. 235 , 39 S.Ct. 442 , 63 L.Ed.

18 Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; Act of May 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 495 . 19 Since 1908 the regulations prescribed by the Secretary under § 2 of the Act of 1908, 35 Stat. 312 and related statutes governing oil, gas and other mining leases of restricted lands, have recognized that proceeds from such leases are restricted and have required that all such money be paid to a representative of the Secretary. See 25 CFR §§ 183.18 , 183.20; see also § 20 of the regulations approved April 20, 1908. 20 In Shaw v. Oil Corp., 276 U.S. 575 , 48 S.Ct. 333 , 335, 72 L.Ed. 709 , the interest of an oil lessee in land purchased for an Indian by the Secretary of the Interior with the Indian's restricted funds and conveyed to the Indian by a restricted form of deed pursuant to conditions imposed by the Secretary, was held subject to an Oklahoma oil production tax. The opinion emphasized the difference between 'a mere conveyancer's restriction' and action by Congress. 21 Two of the decedents died before the Act was passed. The House Committee report, however, makes it clear that the restriction on funds was intended to be declaratory and retroactive. H.Rep. No.
