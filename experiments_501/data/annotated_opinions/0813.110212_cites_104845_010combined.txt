Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 234 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  Accord, United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 , *51 709-710 (1974).  Here we must decide whether the privilege against adverse spousal testimony promotes sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for probative evidence in the administration of criminal justice.  It is essential to remember that the Hawkins privilege is not needed to protect information privately disclosed between husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship once described by this Court as "the best solace of human existence." Stein v. Bowman, 13 Pet., at 223 .  Those confidences are privileged under the independent rule protecting confidential marital communications.  Blau v. United States, <citedDecision>340 U. S. 332</citedDecision> (1951); see n. 5, supra. The Hawkins privilege is invoked, not to exclude private marital communications, but rather to exclude evidence of criminal acts and of communications made in the presence of third persons.  No other testimonial privilege sweeps so broadly.  The privileges between priest and penitent, attorney and client, and physician and patient limit protection to private communications.  These privileges are rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust.  The priest-penitent privilege recognizes the human need to disclose to a spiritual counselor, in total and absolute confidence, what are believed to be flawed acts or thoughts and to receive priestly consolation and guidance in return.  The lawyer-client privilege rests on the need for the advocate and counselor to know all that relates to the client's reasons for seeking representation if the professional mission is to be carried out.  Similarly, the physician must know all that a patient can articulate in order to identify and to treat disease; barriers to full disclosure would impair diagnosis and treatment.
**Combined Opinion**
 [1]  In response to the question whether divorce was contemplated, Mrs. Trammel testified that her husband had said that "I would go my way and he would go his." App. 27.  [2]  The Government represents to the Court that Elizabeth Trammel has not been prosecuted for her role in the conspiracy.  [3]  Roberts and Freeman were also convicted.  Roberts was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.  Freeman received an indeterminate sentence under the Youth Corrections Act.  [4]  See Brosman, Edward Livingston and Spousal Testimony in Louisiana, 11 Tulane L. Rev. 243 (1937); Hutchins & Slesinger, Some Observations on the Law of Evidence: Family Relations, 13 Minn. L. Rev. 675 (1929); Note, 24 Calif. L. Rev. 472 (1936); Note, 35 Mich. L. Rev. 329 (1936); Note, 10 So. Cal. L. Rev. 94 (1936); Note, 20 Minn. L. Rev. 693 (1936); [5]  This Court recognized just such a confidential marital communications privilege in Wolfle v. United States, 291 U. S. 7 (1934), and in Blau v. United States, <citedDecision>340 U. S. 332</citedDecision> (1951).  In neither case, however, did the Court adopt the Wigmore view that the communications privilege be substituted in place of the privilege against adverse spousal testimony.  The privilege as to confidential marital communications is not at issue in the instant case; accordingly, our holding today does not disturb Wolfle and <citedDecision>Blau</citedDecision> .  [6]  See Note, Competency of One Spouse to Testify Against the Other in Criminal Cases Where the Testimony Does Not Relate to Confidential Communications: Modern Trend, 38 Va. L. Rev. 359 (1952).  [7]  The decision in Wyatt recognized an exception to Hawkins for cases in which one spouse commits a crime against the other.  362 U. S., at 526 .  This exception, placed on the ground of necessity, was a longstanding one at common law. See Lord Audley's Case, 123 Eng. Rep. 1140 (1631); 8 Wigmore § 2239.  It has been expanded since then to include crimes against the spouse's property, see Herman v. United States, 220 F. 2d 219, 226 (CA4 1955), and in recent years crimes against children of either spouse, United States v. Allery, 526 F. 2d 1362 (CA8 1975).  Similar exceptions have been found to the confidential marital communications privilege.
