 8 At the close of evidence in the jury trial of Continental’s claims, Sylvania requested the District Court to instruct the jury that its location restriction was illegal only if it unreasonably restrained or suppressed competition.  App. 5-6, 9-15.  Relying on this Court’s decision in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., supra, the District Court rejected the proffered instruction in favor of the following one: “Therefore, if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that Sylvania entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy with one or more of its dealers pursuant to which Sylvania exercised dominion or control over the *41 products sold to the dealer, after having parted with title and risk to the products, you must find any effort thereafter to restrict outlets or store locations from which its dealers resold the merchandise which they had purchased from Sylvania to be a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, regardless of the reasonableness of the location restrictions.” App. 492.  In answers to special interrogatories, the jury found that Sylvania had engaged “in a contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the antitrust laws with respect to location restrictions alone,” and assessed Continental’s damages at $591,505, which was trebled pursuant to 15 U. S. C. § 15 to produce an award of $1,774,515.  App. 498, 501.  9 On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed by a divided vote.  <citedDecision>537 F. 2d 980</citedDecision> (1976).  The court acknowledged that there is language in Schwinn that could be read to support the District Court’s instruction but concluded that Schwinn was distinguishable on several grounds.  Contrasting the nature of the restrictions, their competitive impact, and the market shares of the franchisers in the two cases, the court concluded that Sylvania’s location restriction had less potential for competitive harm than the restrictions invalidated in Schwinn and thus should be judged under the “rule of reason” rather than the per se rule stated in Schwinn.  The court found support for its *42 position in the policies of the Sherman Act and in the decisions of other federal courts involving nonprice vertical restrictions.  10 We granted Continental's petition for certiorari to resolve this important question of antitrust law. 429 U. S. 893 (1976).  11 II A We turn first to Continental’s contention that Sylvania’s restriction on retail locations is a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act as interpreted in Schwinn.  The restrictions at issue in Schwinn were part of a three-tier distribution system comprising, in addition to Arnold, Schwinn & Co. (Schwinn), 22 intermediate distributors and a network of franchised retailers.

 Other claims made by Continental were either rejected by the jury or withdrawn by Continental.  Most important was the jury’s rejection of the allegation that the location restriction was part of a larger scheme to fix prices.  A pendent claim that Sylvania and Maguire had willfully and maliciously caused injury to Continental’s business in violation of California law also was rejected by the jury, and a pendent breach-of-contract claim was withdrawn by Continental during the course of the proceedings.  The parties eventually stipulated to a judgment for Maguire on its claim against Continental.  There were two major dissenting opinions.  Judge Kilkenny argued that the present ease is indistinguishable from Schwinn and that the jury had been correctly instructed.  Agreeing with Judge Kilkenny’s interpretation of Schwinn, Judge Browning stated that he found the interpretation responsive to and justified by the need to protect “ ‘individual traders from unnecessary restrictions upon their freedom of action.’ ” <citedDecision>537 F. 2d, at 1021</citedDecision> .  See n. 21, infra.  This Court has never given plenary consideration to the question of the proper antitrust analysis of location restrictions.  Before Schwinn such restrictions had been sustained in Boro Hall Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 124 F. 2d 822 (CA2 1942).  Since the decision in Schwinn, location restrictions have been sustained by three Courts of Appeals, including the decision below.  Salco Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 517 F. 2d 567 (CA10 1975); Kaiser v. General Motors Corp., 396 F. Supp. 33 (ED Pa. 1975), affirmance order, 530 F. 2d 964 (CA3 1976).  The distinctions drawn by the Court of Appeals and endorsed in Mr. Justice White's separate opinion have no basis in Schwinn.

 Applying the rule of reason to the restrictions imposed in nonsale transactions, the Court stressed that there was “no showing that [competitive bicycles were] not in all respects reasonably interchangeable as articles of competitive commerce with the Schwinn product” and that it did “not regard Schwinn’s claim of product excellence as establishing the contrary.” 388 U. S., at 381 , and n. 7.  Although Schwinn did hint at preferential treatment for new entrants and failing firms, the District Court below did not even submit Sylvania’s claim that it was failing to the jury.  Accordingly, Mr. Justice White’s position appears to reflect an extension of Schwinn in this regard.  Having crossed the “failing firm” line, Mr. Justice White attempts neither to draw a new one nor to explain why one should be drawn at all. A former Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division has described Schwinn as “an exercise in barren formalism” that is “artificial and unresponsive to the competitive needs of the real world.” Baker, Vertical Restraints in Times of Change: From White to Schwinn to Where?, 44 Antitrust L. J. 537 (1975).  See, e. g., Handler, The Twentieth Annual Antitrust Review — 1967, 53 Va. L. Rev. 1667 (1967); McLaren, Territorial and Customer Restrictions, Consignments, Suggested Retail Prices and Refusals to Deal, 37 Antitrust L. J. 137 (1968); Pollock, Alternative Distribution Methods After Schwinn, 63 Nw. U. L.

Prob. 497 (1974); Note, Territorial and Customer Restrictions: A Trend Toward a Broader Rule of Reason?, 40 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 123 (1971); Note, Territorial Restrictions and Per Se Rules — -A Re-evaluation of the Schwinn and Sealy Doctrines, 70 Mich. L. Rev. 616 (1972).  But see Louis, Vertical Distributional Restraints Under Schwinn and Sylvania: An Argument for the Continuing Use of a Partial Per Se Approach, 75 Mich. L. Rev. 275 (1976); Zimmerman, Distribution Restrictions After Sealy and Schwinn, 12 Antitrust Bull. 1181 (1967).  For a more inclusive list of articles and comments, see <citedDecision>537 F. 2d, at 988</citedDecision> n. 13.  Indeed, as one commentator has observed, many courts “have struggled to distinguish or limit Schwinn in ways that are a tribute to judicial ingenuity.” Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 272.  Thus, the statement in Schwinn that post-sale vertical restrictions as to customers or territories are “unreasonable without more,” 388 U. S., at 379 , has been interpreted to allow an exception to the per se rule where the manufacturer proves “more” by showing that the restraints will protect consumers against injury and the manufacturer against product liability claims.  See, e. g., Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F. 2d 932, 936-938 (CA3 1970) (en banc).  Similarly, the statement that Schwinn’s enforcement of its restrictions had been “ ‘firm and resolute,’ ” 388 U. S., at 372 , has been relied upon to distinguish cases lacking that element.  See, e. g., Janel Sales Corp. v. Lanvin Parfums, Inc., 396 F. 2d 398, 406 (CA2 1968).  Other factual distinctions have been drawn to justify upholding territorial restrictions *49 that would seem to fall within the scope of the Schwinn per se rule.

 The Court did not specifically refer to intrabrand competition, but this meaning is clear from the context.  The Court also stated that to impose vertical restrictions in sale transactions would “violate the ancient rule against restraints on alienation.” 388 U. S., at 380 .  This isolated reference has provoked sharp criticism from virtually all of the commentators on the decision, most of whom have regarded the Court’s apparent reliance on the “ancient rule” as both a misreading of legal history and a perversion of antitrust analysis.  See, e. g., Handler, supra, n. 13, at 1684-1686; Posner, supra, n. 13, at 295-296; Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 270-271; but see Louis, supra, n. 13, at 276 n. 6.  We quite agree with Me. Justice Stewaet’s dissenting comment in Schwinn that “the state of the common law 400 or even 100 years ago is irrelevant to the issue before us: the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional restraints in the American economy today.” 388 U. S., at 392 .  We are similarly unable to accept Judge Browning’s interpretation of Schwinn.  In his dissent below he argued that the decision reflects the view that the Sherman Act was intended to prohibit restrictions on the autonomy of independent businessmen even though they have no impact on “price, quality, and quantity of goods and services,” <citedDecision>537 F. 2d, at 1019</citedDecision> .  This view is certainly not explicit in Schwinn, which purports to be based on an examination of the “impact [of the restrictions] upon the marketplace.” 388 U. S., at 374 .  Competitive economies have social and political as well as economic advantages, see e. g., Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S., at 4 , but an antitrust policy divorced from market considerations would lack any objective benchmarks.  As Mr. Justice Brandéis reminded us: “Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains.  To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence.” Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U. S., at 238 .  Although Mr. Justice White’s opinion endorses Judge Browning’s interpretation, post, at 66-68, it purports to distinguish Schwinn on grounds inconsistent with that interpretation, post, at 71.  In that regard, the Court specifically stated that a more complete prohibition “might severely hamper smaller enterprises resorting to reasonable methods of meeting the competition of giants and of merchandising through independent dealers.” 388 U. S., at 380 .
