<p id="b288-8">Although we joined the <em>per curiam </em>decision in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106050"><a href="/opinion/106050/parker-v-ellis/" aria-description="Citation for case: Parker v. Ellis">362 U. S. 574</a></span>, we are now persuaded that what the Court there decided was wrong insofar as it held that even though a man be in custody when he initiates <page-number citation-index="1" label="243">*243</page-number>a habeas corpus proceeding, the statutory power of the federal courts to proceed to a final adjudication of his claims depends upon his remaining in custody. Consequently we concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court.</p>
<judges id="b289-5">Mr. Justice Harlan also notes that his views upon the issue discussed in his separate concurring opinion in <span class="citation" data-id="106050"><a href="/opinion/106050/parker-v-ellis/#576" aria-description="Citation for case: Parker v.
