Burlington, as overruled in the particular referred to, by later cases in this court. See 1 Dillon's Mun. Cor. 4th ed. §§ 507, 507 a.","While the Acting Decision cites and relies on Merrill v. Monticello, it does not overrule it. Rather, it uses Merrill to support its reasoning."
93311,87743,Rogers v. Burlington,yes,"We, therefore, must regard the cases of Rogers v. Burlington and Mitchell v. Burlington, as overruled in the particular referred to, by later cases in this court.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Rogers v. Burlington is overruled regarding its holding about municipal corporations' power to issue negotiable bonds under a general borrowing authority.
93311,91125,Claiborne County v. Brooks,no,"The court, speaking again by Mr. Justice Bradley, held that it did not, and said: 'Our opinion is, that mere political bodies, constituted as counties are...'",The Acting Decision cites Claiborne County v.

Burlington, as overruled in the particular referred to, by later cases in this court.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Mitchell v. Burlington is overruled regarding its holding about municipal corporations' power to issue negotiable bonds under a general borrowing authority.
93311,88640,Police Jury v. Britton,no,"Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, after observing that the police jury had no express authority to issue bonds...",The Acting Decision cites Police Jury v. Britton approvingly and uses it to support its reasoning. There is no indication of overruling.
92291,88699,Osborne v. Mobile,yes,"In view of the course of decisions which have been made since that time, it is very certain that such an ordinance would now be regarded as repugnant to the power conferred upon Congress to regulate commerce among the several States.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Osborne v. Mobile's holding would now be considered unconstitutional and repugnant to Congress's commerce power, effectively overruling it."
92291,89664,Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co.,no,"In the case of The Pensacola Telegraph Company v. The Western Union Telegraph Company, 96 U.S. 1, we held that it was not only the right, but the duty of Congress to take care that intercourse among the States and the transmission of intelligence between them be not obstructed or unnecessarily incumbered by state legislation","The Acting Decision cites and relies on this case as valid precedent to support its reasoning, rather than overruling it."
92291,90600,Telegraph Co. v. Texas,no,"In Western Union Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U.S. 460, we decided that a State cannot lay a tax on the interstate business of a telegraph company, as it is interstate commerce","The Acting Decision cites and follows this precedent to support its conclusion, rather than overruling it."
92291,91869,Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District,no,"It comes plainly within the principle of the decisions lately made by this court in Robbins v. The Taxing District of Shelby County, 120 U.S. 489","The Acting Decision relies on this case as valid precedent to support its reasoning, rather than overruling it."
92291,91985,Philadelphia & Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania,no,"It comes plainly within the principle of the decisions lately made by this court in...Philadelphia and Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U.S. 326","The Acting Decision cites and follows this precedent to support its conclusion, rather than overruling it."

93904,87423,Suydam v. Williamson (1861),no,"The opinion of the Supreme Court of the State appears to have been formed upon full consideration of the difficulties of the case; and is entitled to great weight, especially upon the construction of the statute of the State.

93904,84798,Lambert's Lessee v. Payne (1805),no,"He begins by giving her 'all my estate, real and personal,' which of itself would carry a fee, unless restricted by other words. Lambert v. Paine, 3 Cranch, 97",The Acting Decision cites this case positively as supporting authority
93904,89382,Brant v. Virginia Coal & Iron Co. (1876),no,"In Brant v. Virginia Coal Co., the bequest which was held to give a life estate, and no power to convey a fee, was only of the testator's estate, real and personal, to his wife",The Acting Decision distinguishes this case but does not overrule it
93904,90983,Howard v. Carusi (1884),no,"See Howard v. Carusi, 109 U. S. 725",The Acting Decision cites this case as supporting authority

Little (1881),yes,"this court is of opinion that the sound construction of this will, as to the extent of the power conferred on the widow, is in accordance with the conclusion of the state court, and not with the former decision of this court, which must, therefore, be considered as overruled","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Giles v. Little is overruled, using clear overruling language"
92059,91368,Poindexter v. Greenhow,yes,"This conveys the intimation, that where the defendants who are sued as officers of the State, have not a real, but merely a nominal interest in the controversy, the State appearing to be the real defendant, and therefore an indispensable party, if the jurisdiction does not fail for want of power over the parties, it does fail, as to the nominal defendants, for want of a suitable subject matter.","The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Poindexter's interpretation of state officer liability by holding that suits against state officers acting in their official capacity are effectively suits against the state, contrary to Poindexter's holding that such officers could be sued individually."
92059,91371,Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad,yes,"And now it is adjudged, in the cases before us, that a suit merely against state officers to enjoin them from bringing actions against tax-payers who have previously tendered tax-receivable coupons is a suit against the State.","The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Allen's holding that allowed injunctions against state officers in their official capacity, establishing instead that such suits are effectively against the state and barred by the 11th Amendment."
92059,88673,Davis v. Gray,no,"Making a state officer a party does not make the State a party, although her law may have prompted his action and the State may stand behind him as the real party in interest.","While the Lead Opinion discusses Davis v. Gray, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it, but rather distinguishes and limits its application."
92059,87371,"Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON, GOVERNOR, &C.",no,"This view was reiterated by this court in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 98, where it was said to be settled, 'that where the State is a party, plaintiff or defendant, the Governor represents the State'",The Lead Opinion cites Dennison as supporting authority rather than overruling it.
92059,91583,Hagood v. Southern,no,"The converse of that case is to be found in Hagood v. Southern, 117 U.S. 52.",The Lead Opinion relies on and affirms Hagood's principles rather than overruling them.

Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 213, 215.","The Lead Opinion distinguishes Lee rather than overruling it, noting its principles apply in different contexts."
92059,85451,Osborn v. Bank of United States,yes,"But what was said by Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, supra, must be taken in connection with its immediate context... This conveys the intimation, that where the defendants who are sued as officers of the State, have not a real, but merely a nominal interest in the controversy, the State appearing to be the real defendant, and therefore an indispensable party, if the jurisdiction does not fail for want of power over the parties, it does fail, as to the nominal defendants, for want of a suitable subject matter.",The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Osborn's holding regarding suits against state officers by reinterpreting its meaning and establishing a new rule that such suits are effectively against the state when officers have only nominal interest.
98124,96356,Rogers v. Peck,no,"Due process of law, this court has held, does not require the State to adopt any particular form of procedure, so long as it appears that the accused has had sufficient notice of the accusation and an adequate opportunity to defend himself in the prosecution.

The citation is used to reinforce the court's argument, not to overrule it."

United States,yes,"Holding this view, notwithstanding our reluctance to overrule former decisions of this court, we now are constrained to hold that the technical enforcement of formal rights in criminal procedure sustained in the Crain Case is no longer required in the prosecution of offenses under present systems of law, and so far as that case is not in accord with the views herein expressed it is necessarily overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that it is overruling Crain v. United States, using clear language that constitutes an Explicit Negative Action."
91306,88061,Texas v. White (1869),yes,"The position there taken that the legislature of Texas, while the State was owner of the bonds, could limit their negotiability by an act of legislation, of which all subsequent purchasers were charged with notice, although the bonds on their face were payable to bearer, must be regarded as overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that this aspect of Texas v. White is overruled, using clear language that constitutes an Explicit Negative Action."
91306,88994,Vermilye & Co. v. Adams Express Co. (1875),no,"We have not quoted the language from the opinion in that case with any view of affirming it. It may admit of grave doubt whether such bonds, redeemable but not payable at a certain day, except at the option of the government, do become overdue in the sense of being dishonored if not paid or redeemed on that day.","While the Acting Decision questions and expresses doubt about aspects of Vermilye, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it."

Hardenberg, 10 Wall. 68, in which the grounds of the former decision were reconsidered and declared to be satisfactory.","While the Acting Decision discusses Hardenberg in context of limiting Texas v. White, it does not overrule Hardenberg itself."
91306,88693,Huntington v. Texas (1873),no,"The same questions, as to part of the same issue of bonds, came again before the court in Huntington v. Texas, 16 Wall. 402",The Acting Decision discusses Huntington but does not take any explicit or implicit negative actions against it.

91306,89668,Cromwell v. County of Sac (1878),no,"To hold otherwise, said this court in Cromwell v. County of Sac, 96 U.

Smith that are inconsistent with states' rights to regulate commutation fares.

99004,93379,Interstate Com. Commiss. v. B. & O. RAILROAD,no,"In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 145 U. S. 263, this court held that a 'party rate ticket' for the transportation of ten or more persons at a less rate than that charged a single individual did not make a discrimination...",The Acting Decision cites this case as supporting precedent rather than overruling it.
99004,98392,Norfolk and Western Railway Company v. Conley,no,"In Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. West Virginia, 236 U. S. 605, 608, after making reference to Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota...",The Acting Decision cites this case as supporting authority rather than overruling it.
99004,98391,Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. North Dakota Ex Rel. McCue,no,It was recognized [in the North Dakota Case] that the State has a broad field for the exercise of its discretion in prescribing reasonable rates...,The Acting Decision cites this case as supporting precedent rather than overruling it.

101368,92485,Friedlander v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co. (1889),yes,We think that the Friedlander case should be overruled so far as it supports such an exception,The Acting Decision explicitly states it is overruling Friedlander's holding regarding the exception that principals are not liable for agents' acts done for the agent's own benefit.
101368,4920593,Roy & Roy v. Northern Pacific Railway Co. (1906),no,"To this extent the case has been often cited and followed. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Nat. Park Bk., 188 Ala. 109, 119; Roy & Roy v. Northern Pacific Ry Co., 42 Wash. 572, 576",The Acting Decision merely cites Roy & Roy as following Friedlander on a different point (regarding bills of lading) that was not overruled. There is no explicit or implicit overruling of Roy & Roy.
101368,5712559,Planters' Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants' National Bank (1887),no,"The state courts, including those of Georgia where the cause of action arose, have very generally reached the opposite conclusion, holding that the liability of the principal for the false statement or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope of his authority is unaffected by his secret purpose or motives. Planters' Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants' Nat'l Bank, 78 Ga. 574",The Acting Decision cites Planters' Rice-Mill Co. approvingly as supporting its position. There is no overruling.
101368,3931352,Havens v.

101913,99897,Gillespie v. Oklahoma (1922),no,These decisions are not controlling here. The nature and purpose of copyrights place them in a distinct category and we are unable to find any basis for the supposition that a nondiscriminatory tax on royalties hampers in the slightest degree the execution of the policy of the copyright statute.,"The court distinguishes Gillespie rather than overrules it, explaining that copyright cases are in a distinct category from the Indian lease cases."
101913,101291,Long v. Rockwood (1928),yes,"The affirmance of the judgment in the instant case cannot be reconciled with the decision in Long v. Rockwood, 277 U. S. 142, upon which appellant relies, and in view of the conclusions now reached upon a re-examination of the question, that case is definitely overruled.",The court explicitly states that Long v. Rockwood is 'definitely overruled'.
103012,101265,Black & White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co.,no,"Criticism of the doctrine became widespread after the decision of Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., 276 U. S. 518.","While the Acting Decision criticizes and discusses this case as an example of problems with the Swift doctrine, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it."
103012,93638,Baltimore & Ohio Railroad v. Baugh,no,"As stated by Mr. Justice Field when protesting in Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U. S. 368, 401, against ignoring the Ohio common law","The Acting Decision cites this case to reference Justice Field's dissent, but does not overrule the decision itself."
103012,4088490,Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. R.,no,"The defendant contended that by the common law of Pennsylvania as declared by its highest court in Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 307 Pa. 203; 160 A. 859, the only duty owed to the plaintiff was to refrain from wilful or wanton injury.",The Acting Decision merely discusses this case as relevant Pennsylvania law without overruling it.

102784,102681,Morehead v. New York Ex Rel. Tipaldo,no,"That view led to the affirmance by this Court of the judgment in the Morehead case, as the Court considered that the only question before it was whether the Adkins case was distinguishable and that reconsideration of that decision had not been sought.","While the Acting Decision discusses Morehead extensively, it does not overrule it. The discussion focuses on explaining the historical context and distinguishing it from the present case."
102784,102224,Nebbia v. New York,no,"In Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, dealing with the New York statute providing for minimum prices for milk, the general subject of the regulation of the use of private property and of the making of private contracts received an exhaustive examination",The Acting Decision cites Nebbia positively as supporting precedent. There is no indication of overruling.
102784,97368,"Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad v. McGuire",no,"More than twenty-five years ago we set forth the applicable principle in these words, after referring to the cases where the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment had been broadly described",The Acting Decision cites McGuire favorably as established precedent. There is no indication of overruling.
102784,94828,Holden v.

Hardy, supra, where we pointed out the inequality in the footing of the parties.",The Acting Decision relies on Holden as supporting precedent. There is no indication of overruling.
103214,94174,Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.,no,"The fact that what the Court now says is inconsistent with what was said in Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501, the latter cannot survive.","While the Acting Decision discusses Pollock, it does not overrule it. The case is cited for historical context and discussion of judicial compensation, but there is no explicit or implicit overruling."
103214,3487033,Gordy v. Dennis,no,"The opinion claims no support from any state court decision. The one it cites, footnote 8, that of the Maryland Court of Appeals in Gordy v. Dennis, 5 A. 2d 69, held that under a clause in the Constitution of Maryland like that in Art. III, § 1, the compensation of state judges may not be taxed.","The Acting Decision merely references Gordy v. Dennis as a state court decision and does not overrule it, as it is a state court decision that federal courts cannot overrule."
103214,100693,Miles v. Graham,yes,"But to the extent that what the Court now says is inconsistent with what was said in Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501, the latter cannot survive.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Miles v. Graham 'cannot survive' to the extent it conflicts with the current ruling, constituting a clear overruling."
103214,85272,M'culloch v. State of Maryland,no,"And in that case he relied on the truth, as put by Chief Justice Marshall in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431, that 'the power to tax involves the power to destroy.'",The Acting Decision cites M'Culloch for its principles but does not overrule it. The case is referenced for historical context and legal principles.
103214,99610,Evans v. Gore,yes,Evidently the Court intends to destroy the decision in Evans v. Gore.,The Acting Decision clearly intends to and does overrule Evans v. Gore.

103172,88308,Collector v. Day,yes,"Collector v. Day, supra, and New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, are overruled so far as they recognize an implied constitutional immunity from income taxation of the salaries of officers or employees of the national or a state government or their instrumentalities.","The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules this case, rejecting its assumption of implied constitutional immunity from taxation of government employees' salaries."
103172,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt,no,The determination in the Gerhardt case that the federal income tax imposed on the employees of the Port Authority was not a burden on the Port Authority made it unnecessary to consider whether the Authority itself was immune from federal taxation,The Acting Decision relies on and extends the Gerhardt case's reasoning rather than overruling it.
103172,85272,M'culloch v. State of Maryland,no,"The arguments upon which McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, rested had their roots in actuality.",The Acting Decision discusses and builds upon M'Culloch's principles rather than overruling them.
103172,100771,Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell,no,"All the reasons for refusing to imply a constitutional prohibition of federal income taxation of salaries of state employees, stated at length in the Gerhardt case, are of equal force when immunity is claimed from state income tax on salaries paid by the national government or its agencies.",The Acting Decision cites Metcalf & Eddy approvingly and uses its reasoning to support its conclusion.
103172,102734,New York Ex Rel. Rogers v. Graves,yes,"Collector v. Day, supra, and New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, are overruled so far as they recognize an implied constitutional immunity from income taxation of the salaries of officers or employees of the national or a state government or their instrumentalities.",The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules this case regarding implied constitutional immunity from taxation of government employees' salaries.
103172,86223,Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County,yes,"From the decision just announced, it is clear that the Court has overruled Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County (1842) 16 Pet. 435",Both the Lead Opinion and Dissenting Opinion confirm that Dobbins is overruled regarding implied constitutional immunity from taxation of government employees' salaries.
103172,102783,Brush v. Commissioner,yes,"From the decision just announced, it is clear that the Court has overruled Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County (1842) 16 Pet. 435; Collector v. Day (1871) 11 Wall. 113; New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, and Brush v. Commissioner (1937) 300 U. S. 352.","The Dissenting Opinion explicitly states that Brush is overruled by this decision, and this is consistent with the Lead Opinion's reasoning."
103290,102529,Colgate v. Harvey (1935),yes,"In view of our conclusions, we look upon the decision in that case as repugnant to the line of reasoning adopted here. As a consequence, Colgate v. Harvey must be and is overruled.","The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Colgate v. Harvey is overruled, using clear overruling language."

Crescent City Live-Stock Landing & Slaughter-House Co.,no,This Court declared in the Slaughter-House Cases that the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Thirteenth and Fifteenth were adopted to protect the negroes in their freedom.,"The Cited Decision is discussed as precedent and its interpretation is accepted, not overruled."

103290,103226,Haguer v. Committee for Industrial Organization,no,There is no occasion to attempt again an exposition of the views of this Court as to the proper limitations of the privileges and immunities clause. There is a very recent discussion in Hague v. C.I.O.,"The Cited Decision is referenced as recent precedent that the Court accepts and builds upon, not overrules."
103292,102488,Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co.,yes,We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine — untenable because they drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept and to which we adhere.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the St. Louis Trust cases, stating they were wrongly decided and created untenable distinctions from the Klein doctrine."
103292,101723,Klein v. United States,no,"Freed from the distinctions, introduced by the St. Louis Trust cases, the Klein case furnishes such a harmonizing principle.","The Acting Decision affirms and reinforces Klein as providing the correct principle, using it as the basis for overruling other cases."
103292,101780,Cyrus H. McCormick v. David Burnet,yes,We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine,The Acting Decision explicitly rejects McCormick as part of the St. Louis Trust line of cases that created untenable distinctions from Klein.
103292,101552,May v. Heiner,no,That decision is indistinguishable in principle from the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases and the instant cases,"While the Acting Decision discusses May v. Heiner, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it. The discussion is primarily historical."
103292,1477043,Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Schwarz,no,I have been able to find only one case decided contra: Commissioner v. Schwarz,"While mentioned in the dissent, the Acting Decision does not overrule this case. It is merely referenced as a contrary precedent."

103292,102489,Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co.,yes,We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine,"The Acting Decision explicitly rejects the St. Louis Trust cases, which includes Becker as it was decided the same day as Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co."
103198,97661,Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States (1912),yes,"We conclude, therefore, that any distinction, as such, between 'negative' and 'affirmative' orders, as a touchstone of jurisdiction to review the Commission's orders, serves no useful purpose, and insofar as earlier decisions have been controlled by this distinction, they can no longer be guiding.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the negative order doctrine established in Procter & Gamble, stating that the distinction between negative and affirmative orders is no longer valid for determining jurisdiction to review Commission orders."
103198,101973,Alton Railroad v. United States (1932),no,"See Alton R. Co. v. United States, 287 U. S. 229, 235",The Acting Decision cites Alton Railroad as an example in its analysis but does not overrule it.

103198,102669,United States v. Corrick (1936),no,"Under United States v. Corrick, 298 U. S. 435, 440, and United States v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 226, 229, the doctrine of 'negative orders' implies a jurisdictional defect which courts must consider sua sponte.",The Acting Decision cites Corrick to explain the historical context of the negative orders doctrine but does not overrule it.
103198,101012,United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad (1927),no,The governing considerations which keep such orders without the area of judicial review were thus summarized for the Court by Mr. Justice Brandeis in denying reviewability of a 'final valuation' under the Valuations Act,The Acting Decision cites Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad as historical context but does not overrule it. The citation is used to explain previous judicial reasoning.
103198,96063,Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird (1904),no,"In both types of situations 'a judgment rendered will be a final and indisputable basis of action as between the Commission and the defendant,' Interstate Commerce Comm'n v.

The citation is used to explain the historical development of the law.

103557,96885,Twining v. New Jersey (1908),no,,The Acting Decision references but does not overrule Twining. It merely discusses the historical context of privileges and immunities interpretation.
103557,87885,Crandall v. Nevada (1868),no,,The Acting Decision builds upon rather than overrules Crandall's principles regarding the right to travel between states.
103557,102529,Colgate v. Harvey (1935),no,See dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Stone in Colgate v. Harvey,The Acting Decision cites Colgate's dissenting opinion supportively rather than overruling it.
103557,86014,Mayor of New York v. Miln (1837),yes,"City of New York v. Miln was decided in 1837. Whatever may have been the notion then prevailing, we do not think that it will now be seriously contended that because a person is without employment and without funds he constitutes a 'moral pestilence.' Poverty and immorality are not synonymous... We are of the opinion that cases which may indicate the contrary are overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly rejects Miln's characterization of poor persons as 'moral pestilence' and expressly states that cases indicating otherwise are overruled.
103505,101453,Sinclair v. United States,no,"And see Sinclair v. United States, 279 U.S. 749. And see. Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364, 374.",The Acting Decision discusses Sinclair but does not overrule it. The case is cited as supporting precedent.
103505,99206,Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States,yes,But for the reasons stated that decision must be overruled.,"The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Toledo Newspaper Co. must be overruled, as it misinterpreted the geographical limitations on contempt power under the Act of March 2, 1831."
103505,88890,Ex Parte Robinson,no,"And when the Act came before this Court in Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 511, Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the Court, acknowledged that it had limited the power of those courts.",The Acting Decision cites Robinson approvingly as correctly interpreting the Act of 1831's limitations on contempt power.
103505,92542,Savin,no,"It was not misbehavior in the vicinity of the court disrupting to quiet and order or actually interrupting the court in the conduct of its business. Cf Savin, Petitioner, supra, at p. 278.","The Acting Decision distinguishes but does not overrule Savin, citing it as valid precedent for comparison."

103555,90350,Dietzsch v. Huidekoper,yes,"The doctrine of the Dietzsch case finds illustrations in the lower federal courts. While it is true that those courts were enforcing foreclosure, that purpose had been accomplished and the enjoined state suits sought relitigation of closed issues.","The Lead Opinion explicitly rejects the precedent set by Dietzsch, which had allowed federal courts to enjoin state proceedings to protect their judgments. The Court overrules this interpretation of Section 265."
103555,100061,Kline v. Burke Construction Co.,no,The fact that one exception has found its way into § 265 is no justification for making another.,The Court cites Kline approvingly and uses it to support its reasoning about limiting exceptions to Section 265. There is no indication of overruling.
103555,96399,Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad,yes,"The Court today lays aside Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273, as inapplicable. The case in our view may be properly cited as a relitigation decision.","The Lead Opinion explicitly rejects Gunter's precedent allowing federal courts to enjoin relitigation in state courts, effectively overruling its interpretation of Section 265."

Cauble,yes,"Loose language and a sporadic, ill-considered decision cannot be held to have imbedded in our law a doctrine which so patently violates the expressed prohibition of Congress.","The Lead Opinion rejects Ben-Hur's precedent allowing federal courts to enjoin relitigation in state courts, effectively overruling its interpretation of Section 265."
103555,93714,Root v. Woolworth,yes,"The foundation of these cases is thus very doubtful. However, we need not undertake to reexamine them here since, in any event, they do not govern the cases at bar.","The Lead Opinion rejects Root's precedent allowing federal courts to enjoin relitigation in state courts, effectively overruling its interpretation of Section 265."
103555,95802,Prout v. Starr,yes,"The 'first come, first served' rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537, was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U. S. 226, 235.","The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Prout's reasoning was 'discarded', effectively overruling its interpretation of Section 265."
103639,2620693,Bullen v. Wisconsin (1916),no,"In that case, a fund had been given in trust reserving to the donor a general power of revocation and the disposition of the trust income during life.

There is no indication of overruling.
103639,103220,Graves v. Elliott (1939),no,"Decedent's complete and exclusive power to dispose of the intangibles at death was property in his hands in New York, where he was domiciled. Graves v.

103639,100955,Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton (1926),yes,"It is plain that if appropriate emphasis be placed on-the orderly administration of justice rather than blind adherence to conflicting precedents, the Wachovia case must be overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Wachovia is being overruled as it cannot be reconciled with other precedents.

103831,103705,Jones v. Opelika (1942),yes,"The judgment in Jones v. Opelika has this day been vacated. Freed from that controlling precedent, we can restore to their high, constitutional position the liberties of itinerant evangelists who disseminate their religious beliefs and the tenets of their faith through distribution of literature.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Jones v. Opelika was vacated, effectively overruling its precedent regarding religious literature distribution taxes."
103831,103355,Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940),no,"Furthermore, the present ordinance is not narrowly drawn to safeguard the people of the community in their homes against the evils of solicitations. See Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra, 306.","The Acting Decision cites Cantwell as supporting precedent and does not overrule it. Rather, it uses Cantwell's principles to analyze the current case."
103831,102601,Grosjean v. American Press Co. (1936),no,"The taxes imposed by this ordinance can hardly help but be as severe and telling in their impact on the freedom of the press and religion as the 'taxes on knowledge' at which the First Amendment was partly aimed. Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra, pp. 244-249.",The Acting Decision cites Grosjean as supporting precedent and uses its principles to strengthen its argument. There is no indication of overruling.
103831,101773,Near v. Minnesota Ex Rel. Olson (1931),no,No direct quote of Near v. Minnesota appears in the text.,"While Near v. Minnesota is included in the metadata, it is not directly discussed or cited in the Acting Decision's text, and therefore was not overruled."

Natural Gas Pipeline Co., supra, that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of formulae in determining rates.",The Acting Decision cites this case as valid precedent and relies on its principles. There is no explicit or implicit overruling.
103915,101364,United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission,no,"Then, as now, the differences were 'due chiefly to the difference in value ascribed by each to the gas rights and leaseholds.'",The Acting Decision cites this case as historical precedent without overruling it explicitly or implicitly.
103915,102280,Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Ohio,no,Later the 'value' of gas in the field was questioned in determining the amount a regulated company should be allowed to pay an affiliate therefor — a state determination also reviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment.,The Acting Decision discusses this case as historical precedent without overruling it explicitly or implicitly.
103915,102091,Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission,no,Under the statutory standard of 'just and reasonable' it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling.

103915,101492,United Rs. & Elec. Co. of Baltimore v. West,yes,"We cannot approve the contrary holding of United Railways Co. v. West, 280 U. S. 234, 253-254.",The Acting Decision explicitly rejects and overrules this case's holding through clear language stating disapproval.
103927,95840,The Osceola,no,"Until the enactment of the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U. S. C. § 688, the maritime law afforded no remedy by way of indemnity beyond maintenance and cure, for the injury to a seaman caused by the mere negligence of a ship's officer or member of the crew. But the admiralty rule that the vessel and owner are liable to indemnify a seaman for injury caused by unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment, has been the settled law since this Court's ruling to that effect in The Osceola",The Acting Decision reinforces and builds upon The Osceola's principles rather than overruling them. It repeatedly cites The Osceola as established precedent for the rule of absolute liability for unseaworthiness.
103927,100007,Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger,no,"But later cases in this and other federal courts have followed the ruling of The Osceola, supra, that the exercise of due diligence does not relieve the owner of his obligation to the seaman to furnish adequate appliances. Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, 259-260","The Acting Decision cites and follows Carlisle Packing Co. as supporting precedent for the principle of absolute liability for unseaworthiness, without any indication of overruling it."
103927,103121,Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith,no,"We have often had occasion to emphasize the conditions of the seaman's employment, see Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, supra, 430-431 and cases cited, which have been deemed to make him a ward of the admiralty","The Acting Decision cites and relies on Socony-Vacuum as supporting authority for seamen's rights and protections, showing no intention to overrule it."
103927,101292,Plamals v. S. S. 'Pinar Del Rio',yes,"So far as this statement supports these assumptions, it is disapproved. We cannot follow it, and also follow The Osceola, supra, the cases which it approved and Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra. We prefer to follow the latter as the more consonant with principle and authority.","The Acting Decision explicitly disapproves and overrules The Pinar Del Rio's holding regarding unseaworthiness and the availability of sound rope, stating it cannot be reconciled with other precedents."
103927,102648,The Arizona v. Anelich,no,"Whether petitioner knew of the defective condition of the rope does not appear, but in any case the seaman, in the performance of his duties, is not deemed to assume the risk of unseaworthy appliances.

Anelich as supporting precedent for the principle that seamen do not assume the risk of unseaworthy appliances, showing no intention to overrule it."
104285,101446,United States v. Schwimmer,yes,"We conclude that the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases do not state the correct rule of law.",The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Schwimmer was wrongly decided and overrules it. The Court rejects Schwimmer's holding that refusing to bear arms disqualifies one from citizenship.
104285,101765,United States v. MacIntosh,yes,"We conclude that the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases do not state the correct rule of law.",The Lead Opinion explicitly states that MacIntosh was wrongly decided and overrules it.

The Court rejects Bland's holding that refusing to bear arms disqualifies one from citizenship.
104285,103367,Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader,no,"We stated in Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119, that 'It would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from reexamining its own doctrines.'",The Acting Decision cites Apex Hosiery only as precedent for analyzing legislative history. There is no indication that it is being overruled or rejected.
103962,103531,United States v. Classic,no,"We did decide, however, United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299. We there held that § 4 of Article I of the Constitution authorized Congress to regulate primary as well as general elections",The Acting Decision uses Classic as supporting precedent rather than overruling it.

103962,101911,Nixon v. Condon,no,"The court refused to decide whether a political party in Texas had inherent power to determine its membership... The court held, therefore, that the State Executive Committee acted solely by virtue of the statutory mandate and as delegate of state power",The Acting Decision discusses Nixon v. Condon as supporting precedent and builds upon its reasoning rather than overruling it.
103962,4209365,Bell v. Hill,no,"Despite Texas' decision that the exclusion is produced by private or party action, Bell v. Hill, supra, federal courts must for themselves appraise the facts leading to that conclusion.","While the Acting Decision disagrees with Bell v. Hill's conclusion, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it. Instead, it distinguishes the federal courts' role in constitutional interpretation from state court decisions."
104380,3917155,Bullington v. Angel (1941),no,The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina would clearly bar this suit had it been brought anew in a state court.,"The Acting Decision discusses but does not overrule the Cited Decision. Rather, it affirms and applies the Cited Decision's preclusive effect."
104380,104182,Guaranty Trust Co. v. York,no,"For this Court has declared in Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 108-109, that a right without a remedy is no right at all for purposes of enforcement by a diversity suit in a federal court sitting in the state.",The Acting Decision cites and relies on the Cited Decision's principle rather than overruling it.
104380,97674,David Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club of America,yes,"Cases like Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club, 225 U.S. 489, are obsolete insofar as they are based on a view of diversity jurisdiction which came to an end with Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Cited Decision is 'obsolete' and overrules its approach to diversity jurisdiction.
104380,103012,Erie Railroad v. Tompkins,no,That decision drastically limited the power of federal district courts to entertain suits in diversity cases that could not be brought in the respective State courts or were barred by defenses controlling in the State courts.,The Acting Decision relies on and reinforces the Cited Decision's principles rather than overruling them.
103916,101696,Carbice Corp. of America v. American Patents Development Corp.,no,"Ever since Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, was overruled by Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U.

American Patents Corp., supra","The Acting Decision cites and relies on Carbice as valid precedent supporting its reasoning, rather than overruling it."
103916,97018,Leeds & Catlin Company v. Victor Talking Machine Company (No. 2),yes,The rule of the Leeds & Catlin case (No. 2) accordingly must no longer prevail against the defense that a combination patent is being used to protect an unpatented part from competition.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Leeds & Catlin rule 'must no longer prevail', which constitutes a clear overruling through Explicit Negative Action."
103916,102889,Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co.,no,"Ever since Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, was overruled by Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U.

103916,103678,United States v. Masonite Corp.,no,"The fact that the patentee has the power to refuse a license does not enable him to enlarge the monopoly of the patent by the expedient of attaching conditions to its use. United States v. Masonite Corp., supra, p. 277.","The Acting Decision cites and relies on Masonite as valid precedent supporting its reasoning, rather than overruling it."
104704,104459,Caldarola v. Eckert,no,The Caldarola case undermined the foundations of Hust... We do not think it consistent to hold that the general agent has enough 'possession and control' to be an employer under the Jones Act but not enough to be responsible for maintenance under New York law.,"The Acting Decision relies on and affirms Caldarola's reasoning about general agents' lack of control, using it as support to overrule Hust."
104704,104320,Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines,yes,"Notwithstanding there may be some undesirable results in overruling Hust, such as loss of rights under the Suits in Admiralty Act by reliance on Hust, we think that in view of Caldarola, the uncertainty as to remedies that the two decisions generate, and the desirability of clarifying the position of the United States as an employer through the War Shipping Administration, that case should be and is overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Hust due to its inconsistency with Caldarola and the need to clarify employer status under the War Shipping Administration.
104704,1476725,McAllister v. Cosmopolitan Shipping Co.,no,"On appeal the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. McAllister v. Cosmopolitan Shipping Co., 169 F. 2d 4.","The Acting Decision discusses McAllister as the lower court decision being reviewed, but does not overrule it."
104704,103979,National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications,no,"We assume, without deciding, that the rule of the Hearst case applies, that is, the word 'employment' should be construed so as to give protection to seamen for torts committed against them by those standing in the proximate relation of employer.","The Acting Decision assumes without deciding that Hearst applies, but does not overrule it."
104704,104389,"American Stevedores, Inc. v. Porello",no,"For the background of the statutory distinctions drawn between public vessels and merchant vessels, see Canadian Aviator, Ltd. v.

104704,103761,Brady v. Roosevelt Steamship Co.,no,"As to the first conclusion, we think it arises from a misconception of the ruling of the Brady case.

There is no indication of overruling.
107685,1236300,Powell v. Alabama,no,The decision did not turn upon the fact that the benefit of counsel would have been guaranteed to the defendants by the provisions of the Sixth Amendment if they had been prosecuted in a federal court.,The Acting Decision cites Powell approvingly as an example of fundamental rights being incorporated. There is no indication of overruling.
107685,102801,District of Columbia v. Clawans,no,"In determining whether the length of the authorized prison term or the seriousness of other punishment is enough in itself to require a jury trial, we are counseled by District of Columbia v. Clawans, supra, to refer to objective criteria.",The Acting Decision relies on Clawans as valid precedent for determining when jury trials are required. There is no indication of overruling.
107685,106545,Gideon v. Wainwright,no,"and whether it is 'a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,' Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 343-344 (1963)",The Acting Decision cites Gideon approvingly as precedent for determining fundamental rights. There is no indication of overruling.
107685,95204,Maxwell v. Dow,yes,Maxwell held that no provision of the Bill of Rights applied to the States— a position long since repudiated,The Acting Decision explicitly states that Maxwell's position has been 'long since repudiated' and rejects its holding that the Bill of Rights does not apply to states.
107685,106259,Irvin v. Dowd,no,"The Court has held, properly I think, that in an adversary process it is a requisite of fairness",The Acting Decision cites Irvin as valid precedent for determining fair trial requirements. There is no indication of overruling.
107679,102317,McNally v. Hill (1934),yes,We overrule McNally and hold that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is 'in custody' under any one of them for purposes of § 2241 (c)(3).,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules McNally, finding that its interpretation of the habeas corpus statute was unnecessarily narrow and inconsistent with the purposes of the writ."
107679,106507,Jones v. Cunningham (1963),no,"[The writ] is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose — the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty.",The Acting Decision cites Jones approvingly and uses it to support overruling McNally.
107679,100122,Moore v. Dempsey (1923),no,"To that extent, it also undermines Moore v. Dempsey, supra, and is inconsistent with subsequent decisions of this Court which have reaffirmed Moore.",The Acting Decision cites Moore positively and uses it as precedent to support overruling McNally.
107679,106548,Fay v. Noia (1963),no,"Calendar congestion, considerations of federalism, see, e.g., Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S., at 415-420",The Acting Decision cites Fay as supporting precedent and does not take any negative action against it.
107606,104585,Shapiro v. United States,no,"We think that neither Shapiro nor the cases upon which it relied are applicable here... Each of the three principal elements of the doctrine, as it is described in Shapiro, is absent from this situation.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Shapiro rather than overrules it, explaining why the required records doctrine from Shapiro does not apply to the present case."
107606,105090,United States v. Kahriger,yes,We conclude that nothing in the Court's opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner's assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Kahriger in the majority opinion, stating that its reasoning about the Fifth Amendment privilege is no longer valid."
107606,101083,United States v. Sullivan,no,"Unlike the income tax return in question in United States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259, every portion of these requirements had the direct and unmistakable consequence of incriminating petitioner","The Acting Decision distinguishes Sullivan rather than overrules it, explaining how the present case differs from Sullivan's circumstances."
107606,105280,Lewis v. United States,yes,We conclude that nothing in the Court's opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner's assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Lewis in the majority opinion, rejecting its reasoning about the Fifth Amendment privilege."
107606,107110,Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board,no,"Should not this Court, especially in view of its recent decision in Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 382 U. S. 70 (1965), overrule United States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22 (1953), and Lewis v. United States, 348 U. S. 419 (1955)?",The Acting Decision cites Albertson as supporting precedent rather than overruling it. Albertson is used to help justify overruling other cases.
107606,106864,Murphy v. Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor,no,"It is suggested that these restrictions might be similar to those imposed by the Court in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U. S. 52","The Acting Decision discusses Murphy as valid precedent and considers extending its principles, rather than overruling it."
107980,107685,Duncan v. Louisiana,no,"Only last Term we found that the right to trial by jury in criminal cases was 'fundamental to the American scheme of justice,' Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149 (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.",The Acting Decision cites Duncan approvingly and builds upon its precedent rather than overruling it.
107980,102879,Palko v. Connecticut,yes,"Insofar as it is inconsistent with this holding, Palko v. Connecticut is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Palko through clear language stating it is overruled, representing an Explicit Negative Action."
107980,94515,United States v. Ball,no,"This case is totally indistinguishable. Petitioner was acquitted of larceny. He has, under Green, a valid double jeopardy plea which he cannot be forced to waive.",The Acting Decision relies on and applies Ball's precedent rather than overruling it.
107980,107730,Sibron v. New York,no,"In Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968), we held that a criminal case did not become moot upon the expiration of the sentence imposed.",The Acting Decision cites Sibron approvingly and builds upon its precedent rather than overruling it.
107980,106862,Malloy v. Hogan,no,"In an increasing number of cases, the Court 'has rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights....' Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1964)",The Acting Decision cites Malloy approvingly and uses it to support its reasoning rather than overruling it.
107965,104914,Dennis v. United States (1951),no,These later decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.,"While the Acting Decision criticizes Dennis's interpretation of the clear and present danger test, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule Dennis. Rather, it builds upon and refines the principles established in Dennis."
107965,102821,Herndon v. Lowry (1937),no,"The Court in Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242, overturned a conviction for exercising First Amendment rights to incite insurrection because of lack of evidence of incitement.",The Acting Decision cites Herndon approvingly and builds upon its principles rather than overruling it.
107965,105537,Yates v. United States (1957),no,"Cf. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 (1957)",The Acting Decision cites Yates as supporting precedent and does not take any explicit or implicit negative actions against it.
107965,99321,Frohwerk v. United States (1919),no,"Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U. S. 204, also authored by Mr. Justice Holmes, involved prosecution and punishment for publication of articles very critical of the war effort in World War I.","While the Acting Decision discusses Frohwerk historically, it does not take any explicit or implicit negative actions to overrule it."
107965,99322,Debs v. United States (1919),no,"Debs v. United States, 249 U. S. 211, was the third of the trilogy of the 1918 Term.",The Acting Decision discusses Debs historically but does not take any explicit or implicit negative actions to overrule it.
107965,101097,Whitney v. California (1927),yes,"The contrary teaching of Whitney v. California, supra, cannot be supported, and that decision is therefore overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Whitney is overruled, using clear overruling language in the majority opinion."
107919,106850,Reynolds v. Sims,no,"Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, held that a State in an apportionment of state representatives and senators among districts and counties could not deprive voters in the more populous counties of their proportionate share of representatives and senators.","The Acting Decision relies on and affirms Reynolds v. Sims, using it as supporting precedent for its ruling on voter equality."
107919,104593,MacDougall v. Green,yes,We have said enough to indicate why MacDougall v. Green is out of line with our recent apportionment cases... MacDougall v. Green is overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules MacDougall v. Green, stating it directly in the lead opinion."
107919,107449,Dusch v. Davis,no,"Dusch v. Davis, 387 U. S. 112, is not relevant to the problem of this case.","The Acting Decision merely distinguishes Dusch v. Davis as irrelevant to the current case, but does not overrule it."
107919,104311,Colegrove v. Green,no,"While the majority cited Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, as their authority for denying relief and while a few who took part in Colegrove put this type of question in the 'political' as distinguished from the 'justiciable' category, that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr","While the Acting Decision notes that Baker v. Carr resolved issues differently than Colegrove, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule Colegrove."
107919,106366,Baker v. Carr,no,"that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 202. When a State makes classifications of voters which favor residents of some counties over residents of other counties, a justiciable controversy is presented.","The Acting Decision relies on and affirms Baker v. Carr, using it as supporting precedent for its ruling on justiciability."
107748,90897,Civil Rights Cases,no,The Civil Rights Cases suggest how Senator Trumbull might have expected § 2 to affect persons other than 'officers' in spite of its 'under color' language,The Acting Decision discusses and relies upon the Civil Rights Cases' interpretation rather than overruling it. The Civil Rights Cases are cited as supporting precedent multiple times throughout the opinion.
107748,104546,Hurd v. Hodge,no,"This Court last had occasion to consider the scope of 42 U. S. C. § 1982 in 1948, in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24",The Acting Decision discusses Hurd v. Hodge as valid precedent and builds upon its interpretation rather than overruling it. The Court cites Hurd multiple times as supporting authority.
107748,1447641,Hodges v. United States,yes,"The conclusion of the majority in Hodges rested upon a concept of congressional power under the Thirteenth Amendment irreconcilable with the position taken by every member of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases and incompatible with the history and purpose of the Amendment itself. Insofar as Hodges is inconsistent with our holding today, it is hereby overruled.","The Court explicitly states that it is overruling Hodges to the extent it is inconsistent with the current holding, finding that Hodges' interpretation of the 13th Amendment was incompatible with the Amendment's history and purpose."
107748,100887,Corrigan v. Buckley,no,"Even if Corrigan should be regarded as an adjudication that 42 U. S. C. § 1982 does not prohibit private individuals from agreeing not to sell their property to Negroes, Corrigan would not settle the question whether § 1982 prohibits an actual refusal to sell to a Negro","While the Court distinguishes and limits Corrigan's holding, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it. The Court merely notes that Corrigan addressed a different question than the one at issue."
107748,90040,Virginia v. Rives,no,"Two of this Court's early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action. Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318","While the Court notes that Virginia v. Rives contained dicta about § 1982's scope, it does not overrule the decision. The Court merely distinguishes the dicta from the actual holding of Rives."
108114,105687,Hoag v. New Jersey,yes,"But in the present case Missouri did not have 'the widest latitude' because Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969), decided after Hoag, held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee that no person shall 'be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb' is enforceable against the States","The Lead Opinion explicitly indicates that Hoag's rationale was based on states having 'widest latitude' in criminal justice, but this foundation was eliminated by Benton v. Maryland, effectively overruling Hoag's holding"
108114,105860,Abbate v. United States,no,"The two prosecutions, the first for the robbery of Knight and the second for the robbery of Roberts, grew out of one criminal episode, and therefore I think it clear on the facts of this case that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited Missouri from prosecuting petitioner for each robbery at a different trial. Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 196-201 (1959) (separate opinion)",The Acting Decision cites Abbate supportively and builds upon its principles rather than overruling it
108114,107978,North Carolina v. Pearce,no,"North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), accorded fully retroactive effect to that holding",The Acting Decision cites Pearce approvingly and relies on its holding about retroactivity
108114,107980,Benton v. Maryland,no,"The doctrine of Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, puts the issues in the present case in a perspective quite different from that in which the issues were perceived in Hoag v. New Jersey",The Acting Decision relies on and builds upon Benton's holding rather than overruling it
108114,105594,Green v. United States,no,"For whatever else that constitutional guarantee may embrace, North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717, it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to 'run the gantlet' a second time. Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 190",The Acting Decision cites Green approvingly and uses its principles to support its reasoning rather than overruling it
108164,105594,Green v. United States (1957),no,There is no relevant factual distinction between this case and Green v. United States. [...] The rationale of the Green holding applies here.,The Acting Decision affirms and applies Green rather than overruling it.
108164,1276937,Price v. State (1968),yes,"We granted the writ, 395 U. S. 975 (1969), and now reverse.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses this lower court decision.
108164,5726506,Brantley v. Georgia (1910),yes,"While the Brantley holding may have had some vitality at the time the Georgia courts rendered their decisions in this case, it is no longer a viable authority and must now be deemed to have been overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Brantley is overruled.
108164,94515,United States v. Ball (1896),no,The continuing jeopardy principle implicit in the Ball case would allow petitioner's retrial for voluntary manslaughter after his first conviction for that offense had been reversed.,The Acting Decision affirms and applies Ball's principles rather than overruling them.
108164,1395638,Price v. State (1968),yes,"We granted the writ, 395 U. S. 975 (1969), and now reverse.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses this lower court decision.
108164,8887067,United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins,no,"See United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 913 (1966).",The Acting Decision cites Wilkins as supporting authority rather than overruling it.
108154,106432,Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson,yes,"Having concluded that Sinclair was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity, we overrule that decision and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.",The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Sinclair is overruled. The majority opinion directly and unequivocally overrules the Cited Decision.
108154,105511,Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.,no,"From the time Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U. S. 448 (1957), was decided, we have frequently found it necessary to consider various substantive and procedural aspects of federal labor contract law and questions concerning its application in both state and federal courts.",The Acting Decision relies on and reinforces Lincoln Mills rather than overruling it. The decision is cited as foundational precedent.
108154,107655,Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735,no,"The decision in Avco, viewed in the context of Lincoln Mills and its progeny, has produced an anomalous situation which, in our view, makes urgent the reconsideration of Sinclair.","The Acting Decision uses Avco as supporting precedent to justify overruling Sinclair. There is no indication of overruling Avco; rather, it is treated as valid law."
108154,103292,Helvering v. Hallock,no,"Nevertheless, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote for the Court, '[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.' Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940)",The Acting Decision cites Helvering approvingly as precedent regarding stare decisis principles. There is no indication of overruling this decision.
108350,103548,Reitz v. Mealey,yes,We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of Kesler and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than one of frustration.,"The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Reitz, stating that its doctrine was 'aberrational' and inconsistent with Supremacy Clause principles."
108350,1198518,Schecter v. Killingsworth,no,The Arizona court has consistently adhered to this construction of its legislation,"The Acting Decision cites Schecter as authoritative precedent for understanding Arizona law's purpose, without overruling it."
108350,288328,Perez v. Campbell,no,"The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the same two decisions.",The Acting Decision merely describes the procedural history and does not overrule this lower court decision.
108350,106365,Kesler v. Department of Public Safety of Utah,yes,We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of Kesler and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than one of frustration.,"The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Kesler, rejecting its doctrine as inconsistent with Supremacy Clause principles."
108350,100616,Lewis v. Roberts,no,"This is long after the Bankruptcy Act was placed on the books and, indeed, long after this Court's decision in Lewis v. Roberts, 267 U. S. 467 (1925), that a personal injury judgment is a provable claim in bankruptcy.","The Acting Decision cites Lewis v. Roberts as valid precedent for establishing that personal injury judgments are provable claims in bankruptcy, without overruling it."
108362,90728,United States v. Harris,no,"The constitutionality of § 1985 (3) might once have appeared to have been settled adversely by United States v. Harris... The Court in those cases, however, followed a severability rule that required invalidation of an entire statute if any part of it was unconstitutionally overbroad... This Court has long since firmly rejected that rule","While the Acting Decision discusses Harris, it does not overrule it. Rather, it distinguishes Harris by noting that it relied on an outdated severability rule that has since been rejected. The Acting Decision finds a way to uphold §1985(3) without needing to overrule Harris."
108362,107201,United States v. Guest,no,"Our cases have firmly established that the right of interstate travel is constitutionally protected, does not necessarily rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, and is assertable against private as well as governmental interference. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 629-631; id., at 642-644 (concurring opinion); United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745, 757-760",The Acting Decision cites Guest approvingly as precedent supporting its reasoning about the right to interstate travel. There is no indication of overruling.
108362,107748,Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.,no,"By the Thirteenth Amendment, we committed ourselves as a Nation to the proposition that the former slaves and their descendants should be forever free. To keep that promise, 'Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.' Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.",The Acting Decision cites Jones approvingly and relies on its precedent regarding Congress's power under the Thirteenth Amendment. There is no indication of overruling.
108362,96885,Twining v. New Jersey,no,The 'right to pass freely from State to State' has been explicitly recognized as 'among the rights and privileges of National citizenship.' Twining v. New Jersey,The Acting Decision cites Twining approvingly as precedent supporting the right to interstate travel. There is no indication of overruling.
108362,104918,Collins v. Hardyman,yes,"Whether or not Collins v. Hardyman was correctly decided on its own facts is a question with which we need not here be concerned. But it is clear, in the light of the evolution of decisional law in the years that have passed since that case was decided, that many of the constitutional problems there perceived simply do not exist. Little reason remains, therefore, not to accord to the words of the statute their apparent meaning.",The Acting Decision explicitly rejects Collins' core holding that §1985(3) only reaches conspiracies under color of state law. The Court states that Collins' constitutional concerns no longer exist and adopts the opposite interpretation that §1985(3) reaches private conspiracies.
108721,102839,Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co.,no,"A state legislature, in the enactment of laws, has the widest possible latitude within the limits of the Constitution... Only by faithful adherence to this guiding principle of judicial review of legislation is it possible to preserve to the legislative branch its rightful independence and its ability to function.",The Acting Decision cites Carmichael approvingly and uses it to support its reasoning about legislative discretion in taxation.
108721,2042261,Lake Shore Auto Parts Co. v. Korzen,no,The Illinois Supreme Court held that Art. IX-A did not affect all forms of real and personal property taxes but only personal property taxes on individuals,The Acting Decision discusses but does not overrule this case; rather it reviews and reverses the lower court's judgment.
108721,103290,Madden v. Kentucky Ex Rel. Commissioner,no,"In taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification",The Acting Decision cites Madden approvingly and uses its principles to support its reasoning about legislative discretion in taxation.
108721,97378,Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.,no,"The Flint case involved a federal tax upon the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity... These advantages are obvious, and have led to the formation of such companies in nearly all branches of trade.",The Acting Decision cites Flint approvingly and uses its reasoning to support differential treatment of corporations in taxation.
108721,101317,Quaker City Cab Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,yes,Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania is only a relic of a bygone era. We cannot follow it and stay within the narrow confines of judicial review,"The Acting Decision explicitly states it will not follow Quaker City Cab and calls it a 'relic', effectively overruling it through Explicit Negative Action."
108730,104590,Ahrens v. Clark,yes,"We can no longer view that decision as establishing an inflexible jurisdictional rule, dictating the choice of an inconvenient forum even in a class of cases which could not have been foreseen at the time of our decision.",The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Ahrens v. Clark by rejecting its interpretation of jurisdictional requirements for habeas corpus petitions.
108730,107824,Smith v. Hooey,no,"In Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969), we considered a speedy trial claim similar to the one presented in the case before us, and we held that a State which had lodged a detainer against a petitioner in another State must, on the prisoner's demand, 'make a diligent, good-faith effort' to bring the prisoner to trial.","The Acting Decision cites and relies on Smith v. Hooey as valid precedent, showing no intention to overrule it."
108730,107679,Peyton v. Rowe,no,"Our decision in Peyton v. Rowe discarded the prematurity doctrine, which had permitted a prisoner to attack on habeas corpus only his current confinement, and not confinement that would be imposed in the future, and opened the door to this action.",The Acting Decision explicitly relies on and extends Peyton v. Rowe rather than overruling it.
108730,91598,Ex Parte Royall,no,"It is true, as our Brother Rehnquist points out in dissent, that federal habeas corpus does not lie, absent 'special circumstances,' to adjudicate the merits of an affirmative defense to a state criminal charge prior to a judgment of conviction by a state court. Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 253 (1886).","While the dissent argues the majority implicitly rejects Ex Parte Royall, the Lead Opinion explicitly cites it as valid law, showing no intention to overrule it."
108730,108193,Nelson v. George,no,"In Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224, 228 n. 5 (1970), we adverted to, but reserved judgment on, the precise question at issue here.",The Acting Decision cites Nelson v. George as precedent and builds upon it rather than overruling it.
108889,101340,Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Baldridge,yes,"The Liggett case, being a derelict in the stream of the law, is hereby overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Liggett, stating it was 'at war with earlier constitutional view' and 'opposed to more recent decisions'. The court directly states 'Liggett...is hereby overruled.'"
108889,107235,Mills v. Alabama,no,"Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214, involved the constitutionality of a state statute in effect making it a crime for a newspaper editor on election day to urge people to vote a certain way on the issues being submitted.",The case is only cited as precedent regarding finality of judgments. There is no overruling language or conflicting holding.
108889,86449,Forgay v. Conrad,no,The exceptions noted have a long lineage dating back to Mr. Chief Justice Taney's opinion in Forgay v. Conrad,The case is cited positively as precedent regarding finality of judgments. No overruling language or conflicting holding exists.
108889,104183,"Radio Station Wow, Inc. v. Johnson",no,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, writing for the Court in Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, 326 U. S. 120, 124, summarized the requirement by Congress that in appeals from federal district courts as well as in review of state court decisions the judgments be 'final'",The case is cited positively as precedent regarding finality requirements. No overruling language or conflicting holding exists.
109346,108288,Durham v. United States,yes,"To the extent that Durham v. United States, 401 U. S. 481 (1971), may be inconsistent with this ruling, Durham is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Durham is overruled to the extent it is inconsistent with the current ruling. This is a clear example of an Explicit Negative Action, using the specific word 'overruled' in reference to the Cited Decision."
109514,321071,Nancy Dukes v. City of New Orleans (1974),yes,"The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.","The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals decision, finding that its equal protection analysis was incorrect."
109514,105546,Morey v. Doud (1957),yes,"Morey is, as appellee and the Court of Appeals' properly recognized, essentially indistinguishable from this case, but the decision so far departs from proper equal protection analysis in cases of exclusively economic regulation that it should be, and it is, overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Morey v. Doud, stating it was erroneously decided and should no longer be followed."
109514,105285,"Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc. (1955)",no,"Legislatures may implement their program step by step... in such economic areas, adopting regulations that only partially ameliorate a perceived evil and deferring complete elimination of the evil to future regulations. See, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical Co.",The Acting Decision cites Williamson approvingly as valid precedent supporting its analysis.
109514,106576,Ferguson v. Skrupa (1963),no,Ferguson presented an analogous situation... We held that the exception of lawyers was not a denial of equal protection,The Acting Decision cites Ferguson positively as supporting precedent for its equal protection analysis.
109514,107256,Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966),no,The governing constitutional principle was stated in Katzenbach v. Morgan,The Acting Decision relies on Katzenbach as valid precedent establishing constitutional principles.
109390,104216,Marsh v. Alabama,no,"The Court today announces that 'the ultimate holding in Lloyd amounted to a total rejection of the holding in Logan Valley.' ... But the Court did no more than decide that question. It preserved the holding of Logan Valley ... Marsh v. Alabama, supra, which the Court purports to leave untouched",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Marsh remains good law and is not being overruled. The Court distinguishes Marsh rather than overruling it.
109390,107692,"Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc.",yes,"Our conclusion is that the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive the Court's decision in the Lloyd case... We make clear now, if it was not clear before, that the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive the Court's decision in the Lloyd case.","The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Logan Valley's rationale did not survive and is being overruled, using clear language of overruling."
109390,108592,Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner,no,The Court's only apparent objection to this analysis is that it makes the applicability of the First Amendment turn to some degree on the subject matter of the speech.,The Acting Decision relies on and reinforces Lloyd rather than overruling it. Lloyd is used as the basis for overruling Logan Valley.
109390,105389,National Labor Relations Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co.,no,The Babcock & Wilcox opinion established the basic objective under the Act: accommodation of § 7 rights and private property rights 'with as little destruction of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other.',The Acting Decision treats Babcock & Wilcox as valid precedent and relies on its principles rather than overruling it.
109390,108591,Central Hardware Co. v. National Labor Relations Board,no,"If, as the Court tells us, 'the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive the Court's decision in the Lloyd case,' one wonders why the Court in Central Hardware, decided the same day as Lloyd, implicitly reaffirmed Logan Valley's rationale.",The Acting Decision discusses Central Hardware but does not overrule it. The case is cited as supporting precedent rather than being overruled.
109344,85534,Brown v. Maryland,no,"Although it was 'sufficient' in the context of Maryland's license tax on the right to sell imported goods to note that a tax imposed directly on imported goods which have not been acted upon in any way would clearly fall within the constitutional prohibition, that observation did not apply, as the foregoing analysis indicates, to a state tax which treated those same goods without regard to the fact of their foreign origin.","The Acting Decision reinterprets Brown but does not overrule it. Instead, it clarifies that Brown's holding was limited to discriminatory taxes on imports and did not extend to nondiscriminatory property taxes."
109344,88429,Low v. Austin,yes,"It follows from the foregoing that Low v. Austin was wrongly decided. That decision therefore must be, and is, overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Low v. Austin, stating it was wrongly decided in its interpretation that the Import-Export Clause prohibited nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes on imports."
109344,105833,Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers,no,"Taxes imposed after an initial sale, after the breakup of the shipping packages, or the moment goods imported for use are committed to current operational needs are also all likely to have an incidental effect on the volume of goods imported; yet all are permissible. See, e.g., ... Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers",The Acting Decision cites Youngstown positively as supporting precedent for its analysis of permissible state taxation. There is no indication of overruling.
109344,86429,Thurlow v. Massachusetts,no,"Mr. Chief Justice Taney's opinion is authority, precisely contrary to the reading of Low v. Austin, that nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes are not prohibited by the Import-Export Clause.",The Acting Decision cites the License Cases (Thurlow) positively as supporting authority. There is no indication of overruling.
109508,105999,National Labor Relations Board v. Insurance Agents' International Union,no,Our decisions since Briggs-Stratton have made it abundantly clear that state attempts to influence the substantive terms of collective-bargaining agreements are as inconsistent with the federal regulatory scheme as are such attempts by the NLRB,The Acting Decision cites Insurance Agents as supporting precedent rather than overruling it. The case is used to establish that neither states nor the NLRB can regulate certain economic weapons in labor disputes.
109508,104636,"International Union, U. A. W. A., A. F. of L., Local 232 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board",yes,"We hold today that the ruling of Briggs-Stratton, permitting state regulation of partial strike activities such as are involved in this case is likewise 'no longer of general application.' Briggs-Stratton is expressly overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Briggs-Stratton (the cited case), stating that its approach to pre-emption is no longer valid."
109508,105866,San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,no,"San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U.S., at 245 n. 4, made clear that the Briggs-Stratton approach to pre-emption is 'no longer of general application.'","The Acting Decision cites Garmon as supporting precedent that helped establish the doctrine being applied, rather than overruling it."
109508,107123,"Hanna Mining Co. v. District 2, Marine Engineers Beneficial Ass'n",no,"And in Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U.S. 181 (1965), we resolved the 'troublesome question of where lies the line between permissible and federally preempted state regulation'","The Acting Decision cites Hanna Mining as supporting precedent to explain the development of pre-emption doctrine, rather than overruling it."
109508,106827,"Local 20, Teamsters, Chauffeurs & Helpers Union v. Morton",no,But the analysis of Garner and Insurance Agents came full bloom in the pre-emption area in Teamsters Union v. Morton,"The Acting Decision cites Morton as supporting precedent that helped develop the pre-emption doctrine, rather than overruling it."
109508,107886,Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co.,no,"Whether self-help economic activities are employed by employer or union, the crucial inquiry regarding pre-emption is the same: whether 'the exercise of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act's processes.'","The Acting Decision cites Jacksonville Terminal as supporting precedent that established the test for pre-emption analysis, rather than overruling it."
109615,104587,Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Stone,no,"In an opinion for himself and two others, Mr. Justice Reed noted that the tax was not discriminatory, that there was no possibility of multiple taxation, that the amount of the tax was reasonable, and that the tax was properly apportioned to the investment in Mississippi.",The Acting Decision discusses Memphis Gas approvingly and uses it as precedent. There is no indication of overruling.
109615,109239,Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle,no,"No question had been raised as to the propriety of the apportionment of the tax, and no claim was made that the tax was discriminatory.",The Acting Decision discusses Colonial Pipeline as valid precedent and uses it to support its reasoning. There is no indication of overruling.
109615,104869,"Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor",yes,"Accordingly, we now reject the rule of Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor, that a state tax on the 'privilege of doing business' is per se unconstitutional when it is applied to interstate commerce, and that case is overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Spector through clear language stating 'that case is overruled.'
109615,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,no,It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business.,The Acting Decision cites Western Live Stock approvingly and uses its principles to support its reasoning. There is no indication of overruling.
109615,105828,"Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. Virginia",no,"In upholding the statute, the Court's opinion recognized that the rule against taxing the 'privilege' of doing interstate business had created a situation where 'the use of magic words or labels' could 'disable an otherwise constitutional levy.'",The Acting Decision discusses Railway Express II as valid precedent that helped expose flaws in the Spector rule. There is no indication of overruling.
109716,107491,"United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co. (1967)",yes,"Accordingly, we conclude that the per se rule stated in Schwinn must be overruled.",The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Schwinn must be overruled. The Court found that Schwinn's per se rule against vertical restrictions was not justified under the demanding standards of Northern Pacific R. Co. and that such restrictions should instead be evaluated under the rule of reason.
109716,336461,"Gte Sylvania Incorporated v. Continental T v. Inc., a Corporation",no,"Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.",The Acting Decision affirmed this Cited Decision rather than overruling it. The Court agreed with the Court of Appeals' application of the rule of reason to vertical restrictions.
109716,105646,Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States,no,"We revert to the standard articulated in Northern Pac. R. Co., and reiterated in White Motor, for determining whether vertical restrictions must be 'conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.'","Far from overruling Northern Pacific, the Acting Decision explicitly adopts and applies its standard for determining when per se rules are appropriate."
109716,1458770,"United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co. (1965)",no,The District Court rejected the price-fixing allegation because of a failure of proof and held that Schwinn's limitation of retail bicycle sales to franchised retailers was permissible under § 1.,The Acting Decision merely discusses this lower court decision as historical background. There is no indication that it was overruled.
109835,109344,Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages,no,"In Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276 (1976), this Court abandoned the traditional, formalistic methods of determining the validity of state levies under the Import-Export Clause and applied a functional analysis",The Acting Decision relies on and applies Michelin's analysis rather than overruling it
109835,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady",no,"We conclude that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, where the Court held that a State under appropriate conditions may tax directly the privilege of conducting interstate business, requires such rejection.",The Acting Decision follows and applies Complete Auto rather than overruling it
109835,104388,Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co.,yes,"To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. stand to the contrary, each is overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules this case in its holding
109835,104859,Canton Railroad v. Rogan,no,"In Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511 (1951), the Court upheld a gross-receipts tax on a steam railroad operating exclusively within the Port of Baltimore.",The Acting Decision relies on and follows Canton rather than overruling it
109835,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,no,"As was recognized in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938), interstate commerce must bear its fair share of the state tax burden.",The Acting Decision cites and follows Western Live Stock approvingly rather than overruling it
109835,102857,Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Commission,yes,"To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. stand to the contrary, each is overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules this case in its holding
110212,105789,Hawkins v. United States,yes,"Our consideration of the foundations for the privilege and its history satisfy us that 'reason and experience' no longer justify so sweeping a rule as that found acceptable by the Court in Hawkins. Accordingly, we conclude that the existing rule should be modified",The Court explicitly overruled Hawkins by modifying the spousal privilege rule to vest only in the witness-spouse rather than allowing the defendant-spouse to prevent testimony.
110212,102164,Funk v. United States,no,"Funk, however, left undisturbed the rule that either spouse could prevent the other from giving adverse testimony.",The Court discusses Funk as precedent and builds upon it rather than overruling it. Funk is cited as supporting the evolution of evidence rules.
110212,106048,Wyatt v. United States,no,The decision in Wyatt recognized an exception to Hawkins for cases in which one spouse commits a crime against the other.,"The Court discusses Wyatt as establishing valid exceptions to spousal privilege, without overruling it."
110212,102181,Wolfle v. United States,no,"The privilege as to confidential marital communications is not at issue in the instant case; accordingly, our holding today does not disturb Wolfle and Blau.",The Court explicitly states that its ruling does not disturb the Wolfle decision.
110212,86090,Stein v. Bowman,no,"It was applied by this Court in Stein v. Bowman, 13 Pet. 209, 220-223 (1839)",The Court mentions Stein historically but does not overrule it. The discussion is purely historical context.
110212,104845,Blau v. United States,no,"The privilege as to confidential marital communications is not at issue in the instant case; accordingly, our holding today does not disturb Wolfle and Blau.",The Court explicitly states that its ruling does not disturb the Blau decision.
110325,106022,Jones v. United States (1960),yes,"The automatic standing rule of Jones v. United States, supra, is therefore overruled.","The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Jones is overruled, specifically its automatic standing rule. The Court explains that the original foundations of Jones have eroded and no alternative principles exist to support retention of the rule."
110325,107636,Simmons v. United States (1968),no,"This Court's ruling in Simmons thus not only extends protection against this risk of self-incrimination in all of the cases covered by Jones, but also grants a form of 'use immunity' to those defendants charged with nonpossessory crimes.","The Court relies on and affirms Simmons, citing it as part of the reasoning for why Jones's automatic standing rule is no longer necessary."
110325,108760,Brown v. United States (1973),no,"As we stated in Brown v. United States, 411 U. S., at 228, '[t]he self-incrimination dilemma, so central to the Jones decision, can no longer occur under the prevailing interpretation of the Constitution [in Simmons].'","The Court cites Brown approvingly and relies on its interpretation to support its reasoning, showing no intention to overrule it."
110325,107872,Alderman v. United States (1969),no,We are unwilling to tolerate the exclusion of probative evidence under such circumstances since we adhere to the view of Alderman that the values of the Fourth Amendment are preserved by a rule which limits the availability of the exclusionary rule to defendants who have been subjected to a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights.,"The Court explicitly states that it adheres to Alderman's view and uses it to support its current decision, showing no intention to overrule it."
110799,2226827,State Ex Rel. Douglas v. Sporhase,yes,The reciprocity requirement of Neb. Rev. Stat. §46-613.01 (1978) violates the Commerce Clause.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the Nebraska Supreme Court's decision by finding its reciprocity requirement unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.
110799,1818257,"City of Altus, Oklahoma v. Carr",no,"In summarily affirming the District Court in City of Altus, we did not necessarily adopt the court's reasoning. Our affirmance indicates only our agreement with the result reached by the District Court.","The Acting Decision discusses but does not overrule City of Altus, instead distinguishing it based on differences in Texas and Nebraska water law."
110799,96834,Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter,yes,"City of Altus, however, is inconsistent with Hudson County. For in the latter case the Court found Geer v. Connecticut, supra, to be controlling on the Commerce Clause issue... In expressly overruling Geer three years ago, this Court traced the demise of the public ownership theory","The Acting Decision effectively overrules Hudson County by rejecting its reliance on the public ownership theory from Geer, which was explicitly overruled."
110799,97421,West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.,no,"The city relied upon West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State",The Acting Decision cites West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. as valid precedent and does not overrule it.
110799,94405,Geer v. Connecticut,no,"In expressly overruling Geer three years ago, this Court traced the demise of the public ownership theory","While the Acting Decision mentions Geer was overruled, it was overruled in a previous case (Hughes v. Oklahoma), not in this Acting Decision."
110719,110119,Arkansas v. Sanders,yes,The Court today ignores the clear distinction that Chadwick established between movable containers and automobiles. It also rejects all of the relevant reasoning of Sanders and offers a substitute rationale that appears inconsistent with the result. Sanders is therefore effectively overruled.,The lead opinion explicitly rejects Sanders' reasoning and holding that warrantless searches of containers in automobiles require warrants. The dissent confirms that Sanders is effectively overruled by the majority's new rule allowing warrantless searches of containers in vehicles.
110719,100567,Carroll v. United States,no,"In Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, the Court held that a warrantless search of an automobile stopped by police officers who had probable cause to believe the vehicle contained contraband was not unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.",The Acting Decision upholds and expands Carroll's automobile exception rather than overruling it. Carroll is cited as foundational precedent supporting the Court's ruling.
110719,109714,United States v. Chadwick,no,"Our conclusion is inconsistent with the disposition in Robbins v. California and with the portion of the opinion in Arkansas v. Sanders on which the plurality in Robbins relied. Nevertheless, the doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude this action. Although we have rejected some of the reasoning in Sanders, we adhere to our holding in that case.","While the Court rejects some aspects of Chadwick's reasoning about containers, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule Chadwick's core holding about the warrant requirement for luggage searches outside vehicles."
110719,110558,Robbins v. California,yes,"And the Court unambiguously overrules 'the disposition' of Robbins, ante, at 824, though it gingerly avoids stating that it is overruling the case itself.",The Court explicitly states it is overruling the disposition in Robbins and rejects its holding that warrantless searches of closed containers in vehicles are unconstitutional.
110719,108184,Chambers v. Maroney,no,"Given Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925), and Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 (1970), the Court's decision does not depart substantially from Fourth Amendment doctrine in automobile cases.",The Court relies on and extends Chambers rather than overruling it. The decision is cited as supporting precedent for the Court's ruling.
110719,392944,"United States v. Albert Ross, Jr.",no,The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.,"This is the lower court decision being reviewed. While reversed, this does not constitute overruling as it is not Supreme Court precedent."
110719,108377,Coolidge v. New Hampshire,no,"We have soundly rejected attempts to create such an exception in the past, see Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971), and we should do so again today.","The Court does not overrule Coolidge. The dissent cites it as valid precedent, and the majority opinion does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it."
111103,102987,Helvering v. Mitchell,no,"As the Court noted in Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S., at 397 . The Mitchell Court viewed the criminal acquittal as nothing more than a determination that the evidence in the criminal setting was not sufficient to overcome all reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.",The Acting Decision relies on and reaffirms Helvering's principles regarding the difference between civil and criminal proceedings.
111103,110331,United States v. Ward,no,"As the Court noted in United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980): 'Our inquiry in this regard has traditionally proceeded on two levels...'",The Acting Decision cites and applies Ward's two-level test for determining civil vs criminal proceedings.
111103,106534,Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,no,"In Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), we set forth a list of considerations that has proved helpful in the past in making such determinations.",The Acting Decision relies on and applies the factors established in Mendoza-Martinez.
111103,407595,United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms,no,"A divided United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed.",This is the lower court decision being reviewed; the Acting Decision reverses it but does not overrule it.
111103,108643,One Lot Emerald Cut Stones and One Ring v. United States,no,"Most recently, in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972) (per curiam), the Court held that a civil action for forfeiture...was not barred by the owner's prior acquittal",The Acting Decision relies on and reaffirms the principles established in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones.
111103,106087,Flemming v. Nestor,no,"'Only the clearest proof' that the purpose and effect of the forfeiture are punitive will suffice to override Congress' manifest preference for a civil sanction. Id., at 249 (quoting Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960)).",The Acting Decision cites and applies Flemming's 'clearest proof' standard.
111103,8178595,Coffey v. United States,yes,"To the extent that Coffey v. United States suggests otherwise, it is hereby disapproved.",The Acting Decision explicitly disapproves and overrules Coffey's holding that acquittal on criminal charges bars subsequent civil forfeiture proceedings.
111404,91894,Ex Parte Bain,yes,"To avoid further confusion, we now explicitly reject that proposition... To the extent Bain stands for the proposition that it constitutes an unconstitutional amendment to drop from an indictment those allegations that are unnecessary to an offense that is clearly contained within it, that case has simply not survived.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules part of Bain's holding regarding the unconstitutionality of dropping unnecessary allegations from indictments, while preserving its broader holding about impermissible additions to indictments."
111404,105978,Stirone v. United States,no,"Stirone, however, stands for a very different proposition... In contrast to Stirone, Miller was tried on an indictment that clearly set out the offense for which he was ultimately convicted.","The Acting Decision distinguishes and reaffirms Stirone rather than overruling it, explaining that Stirone dealt with broadening indictments while the present case deals with narrowing them."
111404,423986,United States v. James Rual Miller,yes,The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed.,The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals decision in this case.
111404,102436,Berger v. United States,no,"See also Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78 (1935)","The Acting Decision cites Berger positively multiple times as supporting precedent, showing no intent to overrule it."
111404,106407,Russell v. United States,no,"See also Russell v. United States, 369 U. S., at 770-771 (following Stirone)","The Acting Decision cites Russell positively as supporting precedent, showing no intent to overrule it."
111404,103976,United States v. Ballard,no,"That our holding today is fully consistent with prior legal understanding is apparent from an examination of the state of the law, as seen by Chief Justice Stone, more than 40 years ago","The Acting Decision cites Ballard's dissent approvingly to support its reasoning, showing no intent to overrule it."
111404,100951,Salinger v. United States,no,"In Salinger v. United States, supra, for example, the Court was presented with facts quite similar to the instant case","The Acting Decision relies heavily on Salinger as supporting precedent, showing no intent to overrule it."
111948,107953,O'Callahan v. Parker (1969),yes,"On reexamination of O'Callahan, we have decided that the service connection test announced in that decision should be abandoned... We therefore hold that the requirements of the Constitution are not violated where, as here, a court-martial is convened to try a serviceman who was a member of the Armed Services at the time of the offense charged.","The Lead Opinion explicitly states that O'Callahan is being overruled, abandoning its 'service connection' test for court-martial jurisdiction."
111948,105326,United States Ex Rel. Toth v. Quarles (1955),no,"The constitutional grant of power to Congress to regulate the Armed Forces, Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, appears in the same section as do the provisions granting Congress authority, inter alia, to regulate commerce among the several States, to coin money, and to declare war.","While the Acting Decision discusses Toth, it does not overrule it. The case is cited as precedent and discussed in historical context."
111948,8982256,"Relford v. Commandant, US Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth (1971)",no,"The service connection approach, even as elucidated in Relford, has proved confusing and difficult for military courts to apply.","While the Acting Decision criticizes Relford's approach, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it. The case falls as a consequence of O'Callahan being overruled, but is not itself overruled."
111948,105525,Reid v. Covert (1957),no,Decisions of this Court after O'Callahan have also emphasized that Congress has primary responsibility for the delicate task of balancing the rights of servicemen against the needs of the military.,The Acting Decision cites Reid as supporting precedent and does not take any explicit or implicit negative actions against it.
111948,105981,Kinsella v. United States Ex Rel. Singleton (1960),no,"The test for jurisdiction ... is one of status, namely, whether the accused in the court-martial proceeding is a person who can be regarded as falling within the term 'land and naval Forces.'",The Acting Decision cites Kinsella favorably and uses it to support its reasoning. No explicit or implicit overruling occurs.
111948,89821,Coleman v. Tennessee (1879),no,"This 'known hostility of the American people to any interference by the military with the regular administration of justice in the civil courts,' Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509, 514 (1879)",The Acting Decision cites Coleman as historical precedent and does not take any explicit or implicit negative actions against it.
112276,1098406,Ex Parte Smith (1988),yes,"The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.","The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling in Ex Parte Smith, finding that no presumption of vindictiveness applies when a second sentence after trial is higher than a first sentence after guilty plea."
112276,107978,North Carolina v. Pearce,no,"While the Pearce opinion appeared on its face to announce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent cases have made clear that its presumption of vindictiveness 'do[es] not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.'",The Acting Decision limits and distinguishes Pearce but does not overrule it. It merely clarifies that the Pearce presumption does not apply in guilty plea situations.
112276,108569,Colten v. Kentucky,no,"In Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104 (1972), for example, we refused to apply the presumption when the increased sentence was imposed by the second court in a two-tiered system",The Acting Decision cites Colten approvingly as precedent and uses its reasoning to support its conclusion. There is no overruling.
112276,111602,Texas v. McCullough,no,"As we explained in Texas v. McCullough, 'the evil the [Pearce] Court sought to prevent' was not the imposition of 'enlarged sentences after a new trial' but 'vindictiveness of a sentencing judge.'",The Acting Decision relies on and cites McCullough favorably as supporting precedent. There is no overruling.
112276,110748,United States v. Goodwin,no,"Because the Pearce presumption 'may operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus . . . block a legitimate response to criminal conduct,' United States v. Goodwin, supra, at 373, we have limited its application",The Acting Decision cites Goodwin approvingly and uses its reasoning to support its conclusion. There is no overruling.
112040,111308,Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,no,"Garcia holds that the limits are structural, not substantive— i. e., that States must find their protection from congressional regulation through the national political process, not through judicially defined spheres of unregulable state activity.",The Acting Decision cites Garcia as current precedent and builds upon its principles rather than overruling it.
112040,104222,New York v. United States,no,"Two Justices reasoned that any nondiscriminatory tax on a State was constitutional, even if directly collected from the State.",The Acting Decision discusses New York v. United States as valid precedent that helps establish the modern intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine.
112040,103172,Graves v. New York Ex Rel. O'Keefe,no,"In Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 (1939), the Court announced: 'The theory . . . that a tax on income is legally or economically a tax on its source, is no longer tenable.'",The Acting Decision cites Graves as important precedent that helped establish modern intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine.
112040,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt,no,"Prior to that the Court had already confined Collector v. Day to its facts in Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405 (1938), which upheld the constitutionality of a federal tax on the salaries of state employees involved in state construction projects.",The Acting Decision cites Helvering as valid precedent that helped develop the modern doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.
112040,110718,Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Mississippi,no,The extent to which the Tenth Amendment claim left open in FERC survives Garcia or poses constitutional limitations independent of those discussed in Garcia is far from clear.,"The Acting Decision acknowledges but does not resolve questions about FERC's continuing validity, explicitly declining to overrule it."
112040,101762,Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States,no,"The commonality of the rationale underlying all these immunities for government contracts was highlighted by Indian Motocycle, 283 U. S. 570 (1931).",The Acting Decision discusses Indian Motocycle as historical precedent but does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it.
112040,94174,Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.,yes,We thus confirm that subsequent case law has overruled the holding in Pollock that state bond interest is immune from a nondiscriminatory federal tax.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Pollock's holding regarding state bond interest immunity from federal taxation.
112258,109016,Procunier v. Martinez,yes,"To the extent that Martinez itself suggests such a distinction, we today overrule that case; the Court accomplished much of this step when it decided Turner.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Martinez's standard as it applies to incoming prisoner mail, limiting Martinez only to outgoing correspondence. The Lead Opinion contains clear language stating the overruling."
112258,111904,Turner v. Safley,no,"We now hold that the District Court correctly anticipated that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the regulations are 'reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,' Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987)","Far from overruling Turner, the Acting Decision affirms and applies Turner's reasonableness standard."
112258,109718,"Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc.",no,The Court's decision to apply a reasonableness standard in these cases rather than Martinez' less deferential approach stemmed from its concern that language in Martinez might be too readily understood as establishing a standard of 'strict' or 'heightened' scrutiny,The Acting Decision cites Jones approvingly as part of the evolution of prison law jurisprudence and does not overrule it.
112258,109079,Pell v. Procunier,no,"We have recognized, however, that these rights must be exercised with due regard for the 'inordinately difficult undertaking' that is modern prison administration.",The Acting Decision cites Pell favorably and uses it to support its reasoning. There is no indication of overruling.
112258,492021,Abbott v. Meese,no,"We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals on the issue of facial validity, but we agree with that court's remand of the case to the District Court for a determination of the validity of the regulations as applied to each of the 46 publications.","While the Acting Decision disagrees with part of Abbott v. Meese's reasoning, it partially affirms its holding regarding remand. This does not constitute overruling."
112258,110075,Bell v. Wolfish,no,"In Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979), the Court upheld a regulation that allowed only publishers, bookstores, and book clubs to mail hardbound books to pretrial detainees.",The Acting Decision cites Bell v. Wolfish as supportive precedent and does not overrule it.
112471,94866,Thompson v. Utah,yes,"To the extent that Thompson v. Utah rested on the Ex Post Facto Clause and not the Sixth Amendment, we overrule it.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Thompson v. Utah to the extent it relied on the Ex Post Facto Clause, stating that the right to jury trial is not related to the definition of crimes, defenses, or punishments which is the concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause."
112471,100734,Beazell v. Ohio,no,The Beazell formulation is faithful to our best knowledge of the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause: Legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.,"Far from overruling Beazell, the Acting Decision endorses and relies on its framework as the correct interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause."
112471,90760,Kring v. Missouri,yes,We accordingly overrule Kring.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Kring, stating that its interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause departed from the original understanding of the Constitution."
112471,1787505,Bogany v. State,no,"In Bogany, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a jury verdict which included a punishment unauthorized by law was void at its inception and had to be set aside.","The Acting Decision merely discusses Bogany as background context and does not overrule it. The decision to modify Bogany was made by the Texas Legislature, not by this Acting Decision."
112471,98427,Malloy v. South Carolina,no,"Later, in Malloy v. South Carolina, supra, we stated that even with regard to procedural changes, the Ex Post Facto Clause was 'intended to secure substantial personal rights against arbitrary and oppressive legislative action.'",The Acting Decision cites Malloy as precedent and does not overrule it. The decision continues to rely on Malloy's interpretation in its analysis.
112301,111683,Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority,no,"Brown-Forman, however, holds unequivocally that to the extent that an affirmation statute has the practical effect of regulating out-of-state liquor prices, it cannot stand under the Commerce Clause irrespective of the Twenty-first Amendment.",The Acting Decision relies on and reinforces Brown-Forman rather than overruling it. The Court uses Brown-Forman as precedent to strike down the Connecticut statute.
112301,107217,"Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter",yes,"In the interest of removing any lingering uncertainty about the constitutional validity of affirmation statutes and of avoiding further litigation on the subject of liquor-price affirmation, we recognize today what was all but determined in Brown-Forman: to the extent that Seagram holds that retrospective affirmation statutes do not facially violate the Commerce Clause, it is no longer good law.","The Court explicitly overrules Seagram's holding regarding retrospective affirmation statutes, stating it is 'no longer good law.'"
112301,102402,"Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.",no,"Writing for the Court, Justice Cardozo pronounced that the Commerce Clause does not permit a State 'to establish a wage scale or a scale of prices for use in other states, and to bar the sale of the products . . . unless the scale has been observed.'","The Acting Decision relies on Baldwin as valid precedent to support its analysis, citing it favorably multiple times."
112301,110758,Edgar v. Mite Corp.,no,"The Brown-Forman Court cited a third extraterritorial decision, Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U. S. 624 (1982), which, though not discussed at length there, significantly illuminates the contours of the constitutional prohibition on extraterritorial legislation.",The Acting Decision cites Edgar approvingly and uses it to support its analysis of extraterritorial effects of state legislation.
112301,507765,In Re Beer Institute,no,"As in Healy I, the Court of Appeals reversed. It held that the 1984 law (even as interpreted by the declaratory ruling), like its predecessor, violated the Commerce Clause by controlling the prices at which out-of-state shippers could sell beer in other States.",The Acting Decision reviews and affirms this lower court decision rather than overruling it.
112301,2370562,United States Brewers Ass'n v. Healy,no,"The District Court, relying primarily on this Court's decision in Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, 384 U. S. 35 (1966), upheld the 1981 law.",The Acting Decision discusses this case as part of the procedural history but does not overrule it. The case is cited descriptively rather than being overturned.
112609,1573917,"Exxon Corp. v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc. (1989)",no,The District Court noted that '[a] prerequisite to the existence of a maritime lien based on a breach of contract is that the subject matter of the contract must fall within the admiralty jurisdiction.',The Acting Decision discusses this case as background but does not overrule it. The case is simply cited as part of the procedural history.
112609,88300,Insurance Co. v. Dunham,no,"In Insurance Co. v. Dunham, the Court explained that, in determining whether a contract falls within admiralty, 'the true criterion is the nature and subject-matter of the contract, as whether it was a maritime contract, having reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.'",The Acting Decision cites this case favorably and relies on its principles to help overturn Minturn. There is no indication of overruling.
112609,105375,Archawski v. Hanioti,no,"In Archawski, supra, the Court held that an action cognizable as assumpsit would no longer be automatically excluded from admiralty.",The Acting Decision cites this case positively as precedent that helped discredit one of Minturn's rationales. There is no indication of overruling.
112609,86949,Minturn v. Maynard,yes,Today we are constrained to overrule Minturn and hold that there is no per se exception of agency contracts from admiralty jurisdiction... We conclude that Minturn is incompatible with current principles of admiralty jurisdiction over contracts and therefore should be overruled.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Minturn through clear language stating it is being overruled and explaining why its principles are no longer valid.
117931,105287,United States v. Bramblett,yes,Bramblett is hereby overruled. We hold that a federal court is neither a 'department' nor an 'agency' within the meaning of § 1001.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Bramblett, finding its interpretation of §1001 was erroneous and that coherence and stability in law will be better served by overturning it."
117931,112296,Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,no,"Stare decisis has special force when legislators or citizens 'have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.'",The Acting Decision cites Patterson approvingly and uses it as authority; there is no indication of overruling.
117931,258536,Daniel Jackson Oliver Wendel Holmes Morgan v. United States,no,"First suggested over 30 years ago in Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d 234 (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), this doctrine limits the extent to which § 1001 reaches conduct occurring in the federal courts.",The Acting Decision discusses Morgan's judicial function exception but does not overrule it; rather it makes Morgan's interpretation moot by overruling Bramblett.
117931,276778,United States v. James Ralph Erhardt,no,"Relying on Morgan, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a conviction several years later 'because § 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents as evidence in a criminal proceeding.'",The Acting Decision cites Erhardt as historical development of case law but does not overrule it; rather it makes Erhardt's interpretation moot by overruling Bramblett.
117931,109680,Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,no,"Respect for precedent is strongest 'in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation.'",The Acting Decision cites Illinois Brick approvingly as authority on stare decisis principles; there is no indication of overruling.
117931,101894,Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.,no,"Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.",The Acting Decision cites Burnet's dissent approvingly as authority on stare decisis principles; there is no indication of overruling.
117958,101414,Sinclair v. United States (1929),yes,"Thus, while Sinclair is not strictly controlling, it is fair to say that we cannot hold for respondent today while still adhering to the reasoning and the holding of that case... Whatever support it gave to the validity of those decisions was obiter dicta, and may properly be disregarded.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Sinclair's holding that materiality is a question of law for the judge, finding it incompatible with constitutional jury trial rights."
117958,112848,United States v. Olano (1993),no,"As to the latter, in United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993), the Court noted the limitations on 'plain error' review by the courts of appeals under Rule 52(b).",The Acting Decision cites Olano as valid precedent and discusses its principles without overruling them.
117958,673512,United States v. Michael E. Gaudin (1994),no,The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.,The Acting Decision affirms rather than overrules this decision.
117958,112868,Sullivan v. Louisiana (1993),no,"We have held that these provisions require criminal convictions to rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt. Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 277-278 (1993).",The Acting Decision cites Sullivan approvingly and relies on its principles.
117958,109698,Patterson v. New York (1977),no,"Within broad constitutional bounds, legislatures have flexibility in defining the elements of a criminal offense. See Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 210 (1977).",The Acting Decision cites Patterson as valid authority without any indication of overruling.
117958,94082,Sparf v. United States (1895),no,"Sparf, supra, the case on which the Government relies, had nothing to do with the issue before us here.","While the Acting Decision distinguishes Sparf, it does not overrule it, instead explaining that it addressed a different issue."
117958,112052,Kungys v. United States (1988),no,"But as we have observed, the characterization of a mixed question of law and fact for one purpose does not govern its characterization for all purposes... Kungys assuredly did not involve an adjudication to which the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial attaches.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Kungys rather than overruling it, explaining that it addressed a different context."
118149,107615,Albrecht v. Herald Co. (1968),yes,"We conclude that Albrecht should be overruled... In overruling Albrecht, we of course do not hold that all vertical maximum price fixing is per se lawful. Instead, vertical maximum price fixing, like the majority of commercial arrangements subject to the antitrust laws, should be evaluated under the rule of reason.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Albrecht, finding its theoretical underpinnings weak and its assumptions about the harmful effects of vertical maximum price fixing unsupported by evidence or experience."
118149,109716,Continental T. v. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc. (1977),no,"Nine years later, in Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 438 U. S. 36 (1977), the Court overruled Schwinn, thereby rejecting application of a per se rule in the context of vertical nonprice restrictions.",The Acting Decision cites GTE Sylvania approvingly and uses it as precedent to support its own reasoning. There is no indication of overruling.
118149,725024,"Barkat U. Khan and Khan & Associates, Inc. v. State Oil Company (1996)",no,The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 93 F. 3d 1358 (1996).,"This is the lower court decision being reviewed. The Acting Decision vacates and remands it, but does not overrule it as a precedent."
118149,112425,Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co. (1990),no,"Most recently, in ARCO, 495 U. S. 328 (1990), although Albrecht's continuing validity was not squarely before the Court, some disfavor with that decision was signaled",The Acting Decision cites ARCO supportively and uses it to build its argument. There is no indication of overruling.
118149,110747,Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society (1982),no,We noted in Maricopa County that vertical restraints are generally more defensible than horizontal restraints.,The Acting Decision cites Maricopa County approvingly and uses it to support its analysis. There is no indication of overruling.
118149,107491,"United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co. (1967)",no,"Four years later, in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967), the Court reconsidered the status of exclusive dealer territories","While the Acting Decision discusses Schwinn, it notes that Schwinn was already overruled by GTE Sylvania. The Acting Decision itself does not overrule Schwinn."
118230,104079,House v. Mayo (1945),yes,"Today's opinion permits review where Congress, with unmistakable clarity, has denied it. To reach this result, the Court ignores the obvious intent of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, distorts the meaning of our own jurisdictional statute, 28 U. S. C. § 1254 (1), and overrules a 53-year-old precedent, House v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42 (1945) (per curiam).",The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules House v. Mayo's holding that the Court lacks statutory certiorari jurisdiction over denials of certificates of probable cause.
118230,103707,Ex Parte Quirin (1942),no,"The Court's only response to these arguments is that they are foreclosed by our precedent, since we decided an analogous issue in Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942).",The Lead Opinion relies on and affirms Ex parte Quirin rather than overruling it.
118230,112643,Payne v. Tennessee (1991),no,"Stare decisis is 'the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.' Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).",The Lead Opinion cites Payne v. Tennessee as valid precedent and relies on its principles rather than overruling it.
118230,111885,Gray v. Mississippi (1987),no,"The sole precedent it cites for the proposition that this makes a difference is Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U. S. 648, 651, n. 1 (1987).",The Lead Opinion cites and discusses Gray v. Mississippi but does not overrule it. The case is referenced as precedent rather than being overturned.
118428,99610,Evans v. Gore,yes,"We now overrule Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before enactment of the tax.","The Court explicitly overruled Evans, adopting Justice Holmes' dissenting view that nondiscriminatory taxes do not violate the Compensation Clause. The Court found Evans' reasoning was no longer sound law and that there is no good reason why judges should not share tax burdens borne by all citizens."
118428,103214,O'MALLEY v. Woodrough,no,"In 1939, 14 years after Miles extended Evans' tax immunity to judges appointed after enactment of the tax, this Court retreated from that extension. See O'Malley, 307 U.S., at 283 (overruling Miles). And in so doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans dissent.","Far from being overruled, O'Malley's reasoning was explicitly adopted and reinforced by the Court. The Court used O'Malley's principle that nondiscriminatory taxes can be applied to judges as a key basis for its decision."
118428,110365,United States v. Will,no,"And in Will, the Court yet more strongly indicated that the Compensation Clause bars indirect efforts to reduce judges' salaries through taxes when those taxes discriminate.","The Court cited Will approvingly and relied on its principles regarding the Compensation Clause. There is no indication that Will was overruled; rather, its reasoning was reinforced and extended."
118428,702629,Hatter v. United States,no,"The Court of Appeals reversed, ordering summary judgment for the judges as to liability. 64 F. 3d 647 (1995).","This case is merely cited as part of the procedural history. The Court did not overrule it but rather reviewed it on appeal, affirming some parts and reversing others."
