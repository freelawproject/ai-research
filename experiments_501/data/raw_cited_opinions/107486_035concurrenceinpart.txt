<author id="b295-6">Mr. Justice Fortas,</author>
<p id="A2x">with whom The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Douglas join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p id="b295-7">1. I agree with the Court that the exhibition of the person of the accused at a lineup is not itself a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination. In itself, it is no more subject to constitutional objection <page-number citation-index="1" label="260">*260</page-number>than the exhibition of the person of the accused in the courtroom for identification purposes. It is an incident of the State’s power to arrest, and a reasonable and justifiable aspect of the State’s custody resulting from arrest. It does not require that the accused take affirmative, volitional action, but only that, having been duly arrested he may be seen for identification purposes. It is, however, a “critical stage” in the prosecution, and I agree with the Court that the opportunity to have counsel present must be made available.</p>
<p id="b296-6">2. In my view, however, the accused may not be compelled in a lineup to speak the words uttered by the person who committed the crime. I am confident that it could not be compelled in court. It cannot be compelled in a lineup. It is more than passive, mute assistance to the eyes of the victim or of witnesses. It is the kind of volitional act — the kind of forced cooperation by the accused — which is within the historical perimeter of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination.</p>
<p id="b296-7">Our history and tradition teach and command that an accused may stand mute. The privilege means just that; not less than that. According to the Court, an accused may be jailed — indefinitely—until he is willing to say, for an identifying audience, whatever was said in the course of the commission of the crime. Presumably this would include, “Your money or your life” — or perhaps, words of assault in a rape case. This is intolerable under our constitutional system.</p>
<p id="b296-8">I completely agree that the accused must be advised of and given the right to counsel before a lineup — and I join in that part of the Court’s opinion; but this is an empty right unless we mean to insist upon the accused’s fundamental constitutional immunities. One of these is that the accused may not be compelled to speak. To compel him to speak would violate the priv<page-number citation-index="1" label="261">*261</page-number>ilege against self-incrimination, which is incorporated in the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="b297-5">This great privilege is not merely a shield for the accused. It is also a prescription of technique designed to guide the State’s investigation. History teaches us that self-accusation is an unreliable instrument of detection, apt to inculpate the innocent-but-weak and to enable the guilty to escape. But this is not the end of the story. The privilege historically goes to the roots of democratic and religious principle. It prevents the debasement of the citizen which would result from compelling him to “accuse” himself before the power of the state. The roots of the privilege are deeper than the rack and the screw used to extort confessions. They go to the nature of a free man and to his relationship to the state.</p>
<p id="b297-6">An accused cannot be compelled to utter the words spoken by the criminal in the course of the crime. I thoroughly disagree with the Court’s statement that such compulsion does not violate the Fifth Amendment. The Court relies upon <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U. S. 757 (1966), to support this. I dissented in <em>Schmerber, </em>but if it were controlling here, I should, of course, acknowledge its binding effect unless we were prepared to overrule it. But <em>Schmerber, </em>which authorized the forced extraction of blood from the veins of an unwilling human being, did not compel the person actively to cooperate — to accuse himself by a volitional act which differs only in degree from compelling him to act out the crime, which, I assume, would be rebuffed by the Court. It is the latter feature which places the compelled utterance by the accused squarely within the history and noble purpose of the Fifth Amendment’s commandment.</p>
<p id="b297-7">To permit <em>Schmerber </em>to apply in any respect beyond its holding is, in my opinion, indefensible. To permit <page-number citation-index="1" label="262">*262</page-number>its insidious doctrine to extend beyond the invasion of the body, which it permits, to compulsion of the will of a man, is to deny and defy a precious part of our historical faith and to discard one of the most profoundly cherished instruments by which we have established the freedom and dignity of the individual. We should not so alter the balance between the rights of the individual and of the state, achieved over centuries of conflict.</p>
<p id="b298-5">3. While the Court holds that the accused must be advised of and given the right to counsel at the lineup, it makes the privilege meaningless in this important respect. Unless counsel has been waived or, being present, has not objected to the accused's utterance of words used in the course of committing the crime, to compel such an utterance is constitutional error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b298-6">Accordingly, while I join the Court in requiring vacating of the judgment below for a determination as to whether the identification of respondent was based upon factors independent of the lineup, I would do so not only because of the failure to offer counsel before the lineup but also because, of the violation of respondent’s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>
<footnote label="*">
<p id="b298-7">While it is conceivable that legislation might provide a meticulous lineup procedure which would <em>satisfy </em>constitutional requirements, I do not agree with the Court that this would “remove the basis for regarding the [lineup] stage as ‘critical.’ ”</p>
