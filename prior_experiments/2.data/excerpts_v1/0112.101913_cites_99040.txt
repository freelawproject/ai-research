**Combined Opinion**
The case comes here on appeal. The Gross Receipts Tax Act (Georgia Laws, 1929, p. 103), describes the tax as laid "upon the privilege of engaging in certain occupations" and "upon certain business and commercial transactions and enterprises." As the tax is measured by gross receipts, the case in not ruled by Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, 282 U.S. 379 , where the tax was based upon the net income of the corporation. Appellant insists, and we think rightly, that the operation of the statute here in question, in its application to gross receipts, is to impose a direct; charge upon the royalties. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co., v. Wisconsin, 275 U.S. 136 , 141. See, also, Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, 245 U.S. 292 , 297; United States Glue Co., v. Oak Creek, 247 U.S. 321 , 328, 329; New Jersey Bell Telephone Co., v. State Board, 280 U.S. 338 , 346. The question is thus presented whether copyrights are to be *127 deemed instrumentalities of the Federal Government and hence immune from state taxation.
