 See 170 U. S., at 353 .  That bit of "logic," resurrected today in MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S concurring opinion, post, at 126, suffers somewhat as soon as one recognizes that he can get off the "slippery slope" before he reaches the bottom.  We have no occasion in this case to determine what minimum number can still constitute a "jury," but we do not doubt that six is above that minimum.  [29]  A ruling that the Sixth Amendment refers to a common-law jury was essential to the holding in Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U. S. 516 (1905), where the Court held invalid a conviction by a six-man jury in Alaska.  The ruling was accepted at the Government's concession without discussion or citation; the major focus of the case was on the question whether the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the territory in question at all. See 197 U. S., at 519 .  [30]  Similarly, cases interpreting the jury trial provisions of the Seventh Amendment generally leap from the fact that the jury possessed a certain feature at common law to the conclusion that that feature must have been preserved by the Amendment's simple reference to trial by "jury." E. g., Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, <citedDecision>174 U. S. 1, 13-14</citedDecision> (1899); American Publishing Co. v. Fisher, 166 U. S. 464, 468 (1897).  While much of our discussion in this case may be thought to bear equally on the interpretation of the Seventh Amendment's jury trial provisions, we emphasize that the question is not before us; we do not decide whether, for example, additional references to the "common law" that occur in the Seventh Amendment might support a different interpretation.  See infra, at 97 and n. 44.  [31]  The Patton opinion furnishes an interesting illustration of the Court's willingness to re-examine earlier assertions about the nature of "jury trial" in almost every respect except the 12-man-jury requirement.  Patton reaffirmed the 12-man requirement with a simple citation to Thompson v. Utah , while at the same time discarding as "dictum" the equally dogmatic assertion in Thompson that the requirement could not be waived.  See 281 U. S., at 293 .  [32]  U. S. Const., Art.

Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ยง 29, 1 Stat. 88 .  [44]  Similarly, the First Continental Congress resolved in October 1774: "That the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to the course of that law. " 1 Journals of the Continental Congress 69 (C. Ford ed. 1904) (emphasis added).  And the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 declared that the inhabitants of that Territory should "always be entitled to the benefits of the writs of habeas corpus, and of the trial by jury .  .  .  and of judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law. " Ordinance of 1787, Art. II, 1 U. S. C. XXXVIII (emphasis added).  See Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, <citedDecision>174 U. S. 1, 5-8</citedDecision> (1899) (concluding from these sources that the explicit reference to the "common law" in the Seventh Amendment, referred to the rules of the common law of England, not the rules as modified by local or state practice).  [45]  One scholar, however, in investigating the reception of the English common law by the early American colonies, notes that the process: "was not so simple as the legal theory would lead us to assume.  While their general legal conceptions were conditioned by, and their terminology derived from, the common law, the early colonists were far from applying it as a technical system, they often ignored it or denied its subsidiary force, and they consciously departed from many of its most essential principles." Reinsch, The English Common Law in the Early American Colonies, in 1 Select Essays in Anglo-American Legal History 367, 415 (1907).  With respect to the jury trial in particular, while most of the colonies adopted the institution in its English form at an early date, more than one appears to have accepted the institution at various stages only with "various modifications." See id., at 412.  Thus Connecticut permitted majority decision in case of continued failure to agree, id., at 386, Virginia expressed regret at being unable to retain the "vicinage" requirement of the English jury, id., at 405, Pennsylvania permitted majority verdicts and employed juries of six or seven, id., at 398, and the Carolinas discontinued the unanimity requirement, 5 F.
