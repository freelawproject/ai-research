 332 U. S. 789 .  Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 , invalidating a New Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community, or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, “except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected.” See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 12 .  Two of this Court’s early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action.  Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 ; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17.  But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra, actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322 .  See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 797-804 .  And of course the Civil Rights Cases, supra, which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 335 , did not'involve the present statute at all. It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31 , characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, <citedDecision>271 U. S. 323</citedDecision> , as having “held” that “[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute .  .  .  [are] directed is governmental action.” 334 U. S., at 31.  But no such statement appears in the <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> opinion, and a careful examination of <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> reveals that it cannot be read as authority for the proposition attributed to it in Hurd .  In <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> , suits had been brought to enjoin a threatened violation of certain restrictive covenants in the District of Columbia.  The courts of the District had granted relief, see 55 App. D. C. 30, 299 F. 899 , and the case reached this Court on appeal.  As the opinion in <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> specifically recognized, no claim that the covenants could not validly be enforced against the appellants had been raised in the lower courts, and no such claim was properly before this Court. <citedDecision>271 U. S., at 330-331</citedDecision> .  The only question presented for decision was whether the restrictive covenants themselves violated the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and §§ 1977, 1978, and 1979 of the Revised Statutes *421 (now 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981 , 1982, and 1983).  Ibid. Addressing itself to that narrow question, the Court said that none of the provisions relied upon by the appellants prohibited private individuals from “enter[ing] into .  .  .  [contracts] in respect to the control and disposition of their own property.” Id., at 331 .  Nor, added the Court, had the appellants even claimed that the provisions in question “had, in and of themselves, .  .  .  [the] effect” of prohibiting such contracts.  Ibid. Even if <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> should be regarded as an adjudication that 42 U. S. C. § 1982 (then § 1978 of the Revised Statutes) does not prohibit private individuals from agreeing not to sell their property to Negroes, <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> would not settle the question whether § 1982 prohibits an actual refusal to sell to a Negro.  Moreover, since the appellants in <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> had not even argued in this Court that the statute prohibited private agreements of the sort there involved, it would be a mistake to treat the <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> decision as a considered judgment even on that narrow issue.  379 F. 2d 33 , 43.  Ibid. Act of April 9, 1866, c. 31, § 1, 14 Stat. 27 , re-enacted by § 18 of the Enforcement Act of 1870, Act of May 31, 1870, c. 114, § 18, 16 Stat. 140 , 144, and codified in §§ 1977 and 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, now 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981 and 1982.  For the text of § 1981, see n. 78, infra.  It is, of course, immaterial that § 1 ended with the words “any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, to the contrary not *423 withstanding.” The phrase was obviously inserted to qualify the reference to “like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other,” thus emphasizing the supremacy of the 1866 statute over inconsistent state or local laws, if any.  It was deleted, presumably as surplusage, in § 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874.  " Several weeks before the House began its debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1866, Congress had passed a bill (S. 60) to enlarge the powers of the Freedmen’s Bureau (created by Act of March 3, 1865, c. 90, 13 Stat. 507 ) by extending military jurisdiction over certain areas in the South where, “in consequence of any State or local law, .
**Concurrence Opinion**
Me. Justice Douglas, concurring. The Act of April 9, 1866, 14 Stat. 27 , 42 U. S .C. § 1982, provides: “All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, aiid convey real and personal property.” This Act was passed to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment which in § 1 abolished “slavery” and “involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted” and in. § 2 gave Congress power “to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” Enabling a Negro to buy and sell real and personal property is a removal of one of many badges of slavery. “Slaves were not considered men. . . . They could own nothing; they could make no contracts; they could hold no property, nor traffic in property; they could not hire out; they could not legally marry nor constitute families; they could not control their children; they could not appeal from their master; they could be punished at will.” W. Dubois, Black Reconstruction in America 10 (1964) , 1 *445 The true curse of slavery is not what it did to the black man, but what it has done to the white man. For the existence of the institution produced the notion that the white man was of superior character, intelligence, and morality. The blacks were little more than livestock— to be fed and fattened for the economic benefits they could bestow through their labors, and to be subjected to authority, often with cruelty, to make clear who was master and who slave. Some badges of slavery remain today. While the institution has been outlawed, it has remained in the minds and hearts of many white men. Cases which have come to this Court depict a spectacle of slavery unwilling to die. We have seen contrivances by States designed to thwart Negro voting, e. g., Lane, v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268 . Negroes have been excluded over and again from juries solely on account of their race, e. g., Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 , or have been forced to sit in segregated seats in courtrooms, Johnson v. Virginia, 373 U. S. 61 . They have been made to attend segregated and inferior schools, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 , or been denied entrance to colleges or graduate schools because of their color, e. g., Pennsylvania v. Board of Trusts, 353 U. S. 230 ; Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629 . Negroes have been prosecuted for marrying whites, e. g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 . They have been forced to live in segregated residential districts, Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60 , and residents of white neighborhoods have denied them entrance, e. g., Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1 . Negroes have been forced to use segregated facilities in going about their daily lives, having been excluded from railway coaches, Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 ; public parks, New Orleans Park Improvement Assn. v. Detiege, 358 U. S. 54 ; restaurants, Lombard v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 267 ; public beaches, Mayor of Baltimore v. Dawson, 350 U. S. 877 ; municipal *446 golf courses, Holmes v. City of Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 ; amusement parks, Griffin v. Maryland, 378 U. S. 130 ; buses, Gayle v. Browder, 352 U. S. 903 ; public libraries, Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U. S. 131 . A state court judge in Alabama convicted a Negro woman of contempt of court because she refused to answer him when he addressed her as “Mary,” although she had made the simple request to be called “Miss Hamilton.” Hamilton v. Alabama, 376 U. S. 650 . That brief sampling of discriminatory practices, many of which continue today, stands almost as an annotation to what Frederick Douglass (1817-1895) wrote nearly a century earlier: “Of all the races and varieties of men which have suffered from this feeling, the colored people of this country have endured most. They can resort to no disguises which will enable them to escape its deadly aim. They carry in front the evidence which marks them for persecution. They stand at the extreme point of difference from the Caucasian race, and their African origin can be instantly recognized, though they may be several removes from the typical African race. They may remonstrate like Shylock— ‘Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter, as a Christian is?’ — but such eloquence is unavailing. They are Negroes — and that is enough, in the eye of this unreasoning prejudice, to justify indignity and violence. In nearly every department of American life they are confronted by this insidious influence. It fills the air. It meets them at the workshop and factory, when they apply for work. It meets them at the church, at the hotel, at the *447 ballot-box, and worst of all, it meets them in the jury-box. Without crime or offense against law or gospel, the colored man is the Jean Yaljean of American society. He has escaped from the galleys, and hence all presumptions are against him. The workshop denies him work, and the inn denies him shelter; the ballot-box a fair vote, and the jury-box a fair trial. He has ceased to be the slave of an individual, but has in some sense become the slave of society. He may not now be bought and sold like a beast in the market, but he is the trammeled victim of a prejudice, well calculated to repress his manly ambition, paralyze his energies, and make him a dejected and spiritless man, if not a sullen enemy to society, fit to prey upon life and property and to make trouble generally.” 2 Today the black is protected by a host of civil rights laws. But the forces of discrimination are still strong. A member of his race, duly elected by the people to a state legislature, is barred from that assembly because of his views on the Vietnam war. Bond v. Floyd, 385 U. S. 116 . Real estate agents use artifice to avoid selling “white property” to the blacks. 3 The blacks who travel the country, though entitled by law to the facilities for sleeping and dining that are offered all tourists, Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 , may well learn that the “vacancy” sign does not mean what it says, especially if the motel has a swimming pool. On entering a half-empty restaurant they may find “reserved” signs on all unoccupied tables. *448 The black is often barred from a labor union because of his race. 4 He learns that the order directing admission of his children into white schools has not been obeyed “with all deliberate speed/’ Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 301 , but has been delayed by numerous stratagems and devices. 5 State laws, at times, have even en *449 couraged discrimination in housing. Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369 . This recital is enough to show how prejudices, once part and parcel of slavery, still persist. The men who sat in Congress in 1866 were trying to remove some of the badges or “customs” 6 of slavery when they enacted § 1982. And, as my Brother Stewart shows, the Congress that passed the so-called Open Housing Act in 1968 did not undercut any of the grounds on which § 1982 rests. The cases are collected in five volumes in H. Catterall, Judicial Cases Concerning American Slavery and the Negro (1926-1937). And see 1 T. Cobb, An Inquiry into the Law of Negro Slavery, c. XIV (1858); G. Ostrander, The Rights of Man in America 1606-1861, p. 252 (1960); G. Stroud, Sketch of the Laws Relating to Slavery 45-50 (1827); J. Wheeler, Law of Slavery 190-191 (1837).

Department of State of New York, 22 N. Y. 2d 690, 238 N. E. 2d 914 . See, e. g., O’Hanlon, The Case Against the Unions, Fortune, Jan. 1968, at 170. The contrivances which some States have concocted to thwart the command of our decision in Brown v. Board of Education are by now legendary. See, e. g., Monroe v. Board of Commissioners, 391 U. S. 450 (Tennessee “free-transfer” plan); Green v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (Virginia school board “freedom-of-choice” plan); Raney v. Board of Education, 391 U.

Board of Education, 373 U. S. 683 (Tennessee rezoning of school districts, with a transfer plan permitting transfer by students on the basis of race); United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education, 372 P. 2d 836 , aff’d en banc, 380 F. 2d 385 (C.

S. 197 (Arkansas statute cutting off state funds to integrated school districts); James v. Almond, 170 F. Supp. 331 (D. C. E. D. Va. 1959) (closing of all integrated public schools). See also Rogers v. Paul, 382 U. S. 198 ; Calhoun v. Latimer, 377 U. S. 263 ; Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 . My Brother Harlan’s listing of some of the “customs” prevailing in the North at the time § 1982 was first enacted shows the extent of organized white discrimination against newly freed blacks. As he states, “ [residential segregation was the prevailing pattern almost everywhere in the North.” Post, at 474-475. Certainly, then, it was “customary.” To suggest, however, that there might be room for argument in this case (post, at 475, n. 65) that the discrimination against petitioners was not in some measure a part and product of this longstanding and widespread customary pattern is to pervert the problem by allowing the legal mind to draw lines and make distinctions that have no place in the jurisprudence of a nation striving to rejoin the human race.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 A. The Court’s opinion focuses upon the statute’s legislative history, but it is worthy of note that the precedents in this Court are distinctly opposed to the Court’s view of the statute.  *451 In the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , decided less than two decades after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, from which § 1982 is derived, the Court said in dictum of the 1866 Act: “This law is clearly corrective in its character, intended to counteract and furnish redress against State laws and proceedings, and customs having the force of law, which sanction the wrongful acts specified.  .  .  .  The Civil Rights Bill here referred to is analogous in its character to what a law would have been under the original Constitution, declaring that the validity of contracts should not be impaired, and that if any person bound by a contract should refuse to comply with it, under color or pretence that it had been rendered void or invalid by a State law, he should be liable to an action upon it in the courts of the United States, with the addition of a penalty for setting up such an unjust and unconstitutional defence.” Id., at 16-17.  5 In Corrigan v. <citedDecision>Buckley, 271 U. S. 323</citedDecision> , the question was whether the courts of the District of Columbia might enjoin prospective breaches of racially restrictive covenants.  The Court held that it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioners’ argument that the covenant was void because it contravened the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments and their implementing statutes.  The Court reasoned, inter alia, that the statutes, including the immediate predecessor of § 1982, 6 were inapplicable because “they, like the Constitutional Amendment under whose sanction they were enacted, do not in any manner prohibit or invalidate contracts entered into *452 by private individuals in respect to the control and disposition of their own property.” Id., at 331.  7 In Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24 , the issue was again whether the courts of the District might enforce racially restrictive covenants.  At the outset of the process of reasoning by which it held that judicial enforcement of such a covenant would violate the predecessor of § 1982, the Court said: “We may start with the proposition that the statute does not invalidate private restrictive agreements so long as the purposes of those agreements are achieved by the parties through voluntary adherence to the terms.  The action toward which the provisions of the statute under consideration is [sic] directed is governmental action.  Such was the holding of <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> v. Buckley ....’’ Id., at 31.  8 B. Like the Court, I begin analysis of § 1982 by examining its language.  In its present form, the section provides: “All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.” The Court finds it “plain and unambiguous,” ante, at 420, that this language forbids purely private as well as state-authorized discrimination.  With all respect, I do not find it so. For me, there is an inherent ambiguity in the *453 term “right,” as used in § 1982.  The “right” referred to may either be a right to equal status under the law, in which case the statute operates only against state-sanctioned discrimination, or it may be an “absolute” right enforceable against private individuals.  To me, the words of the statute, taken alone, suggest the former interpretation, not the latter.  9 Further, since intervening revisions have not been meant to alter substance, the intended meaning of § 1982 must be drawn from the words in which it was originally enacted.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 See id., at 16, 17, 21 .  Adoption of a “state action” construction of the Civil Rights Act would therefore have the additional merit of bringing its interpretation into line with that of the Fourteenth Amendment, which this Court has consistently held to reach only “state action.” This seems especially desirable in light of the wide agreement that a major purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, at least in the minds of its congressional proponents, was to assure that the rights conferred by the then recently enacted Civil Rights Act could not be taken away by a subsequent Congress.  66 II.  The foregoing, I think, amply demonstrates that the Court has chosen to resolve this ease by according to a loosely worded statute a meaning which is open to the strongest challenge in light of the statute’s legislative history.  In holding that the Thirteenth Amendment is sufficient constitutional authority for § 1982 as interpreted, the Court also decides a question of great importance.  Even contemporary supporters of the aims of the 1866 Civil Rights Act doubted that those goals could constitutionally be achieved under the Thirteenth Amendment, 67 and this Court has twice expressed similar *477 doubts.  See Hodges v. United States, 203 U. S. 1, 16-18 ; Corrigan v. Buckley, <citedDecision>271 U. S. 323, 330</citedDecision> .  But cf. Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 22 .  Thus, it is plain that the course of decision followed by the Court today entails the resolution of important and difficult issues.  The only apparent way of deciding this case without reaching those issues would be to hold that the petitioners are entitled to relief on the alternative ground advanced by them: that the respondents’ conduct amounted to “state action” forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.  However, that route is not without formidable obstacles of its own, for the opinion of the Court of Appeals makes it clear that this case differs substantially from any “state action” case previously decided by this Court. See 379 F. 2d, at 40-45.  The fact that a case is “hard” does not, of course, relieve a judge of his duty to decide it.  Since, the Court did vote to hear this case, I normally would consider myself obligated to decide whether the petitioners are entitled to relief on either of the grounds on which they rely.

**Combined Opinion**
 [24]  Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 , invalidating a New Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community, or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, "except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected." See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 12 .  [25]  Two of this Court's early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action.  Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 ; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17.  But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra , actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322.  See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 797-804 .  And of course the Civil Rights Cases, supra , which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 335 , did not involve the present statute at all. It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31 , characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, <citedDecision>271 U. S. 323</citedDecision> , as having "held" that "[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute .  .  .  [are] directed is governmental action." 334 U. S., at 31.  But no such statement appears in the <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> opinion, and a careful examination of <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> reveals that it cannot be read as authority for the proposition attributed to it in Hurd .  In <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> , suits had been brought to enjoin a threatened violation of certain restrictive covenants in the District of Columbia.  The courts of the District had granted relief, see 55 App. D. C. 30, 299 F. 899 , and the case reached this Court on appeal.  As the opinion in <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> specifically recognized, no claim that the covenants could not validly be enforced against the appellants had been raised in the lower courts, and no such claim was properly before this Court. <citedDecision>271 U. S., at 330-331</citedDecision> .  The only question presented for decision was whether the restrictive covenants themselves violated the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and §§ 1977, 1978, and 1979 of the Revised Statutes (now 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981 , 1982, and 1983).  Ibid. Addressing itself to that narrow question, the Court said that none of the provisions relied upon by the appellants prohibited private individuals from "enter[ing] into .  .  .  [contracts] in respect to the control and disposition of their own property." Id., at 331 .  Nor, added the Court, had the appellants even claimed that the provisions in question "had, in and of themselves, .  .  .  [the] effect" of prohibiting such contracts.  Ibid. Even if <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> should be regarded as an adjudication that 42 U. S. C. § 1982 (then § 1978 of the Revised Statutes) does not prohibit private individuals from agreeing not to sell their property to Negroes, <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> would not settle the question whether § 1982 prohibits an actual refusal to sell to a Negro.  Moreover, since the appellants in <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> had not even argued in this Court that the statute prohibited private agreements of the sort there involved, it would be a mistake to treat the <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> decision as a considered judgment even on that narrow issue.  [26] 379 F. 2d 33 , 43.  [27] Ibid. [28]  Act of April 9, 1866, c. 31, § 1, 14 Stat. 27 , re-enacted by § 18 of the Enforcement Act of 1870, Act of May 31, 1870, c. 114, § 18, 16 Stat. 140 , 144, and codified in §§ 1977 and 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, now 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981 and 1982.  For the text of § 1981, see n. 78, infra.  [29]  It is, of course, immaterial that § 1 ended with the words "any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding." The phrase was obviously inserted to qualify the reference to "like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other," thus emphasizing the supremacy of the 1866 statute over inconsistent state or local laws, if any.  It was deleted, presumably as surplusage, in § 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874.
