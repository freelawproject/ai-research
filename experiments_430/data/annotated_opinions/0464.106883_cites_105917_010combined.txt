 .  trial could surely vouchsafe no less to an indicted defendant under interrogation by the police in a completely extrajudicial proceeding.  Anything less .  .  .  might deny a defendant `effective representation by counsel at the only stage when *485 legal aid and advice would help him.' " Id., at 204 , quoting DOUGLAS, J., concurring in Spano v. New York, <citedDecision>360 U. S. 315, 326</citedDecision> .  The interrogation here was conducted before petitioner was formally indicted.  But in the context of this case, that fact should make no difference.  When petitioner requested, and was denied, an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, the investigation had ceased to be a general investigation of "an unsolved crime." Spano v. New York, <citedDecision>360 U. S. 315, 327</citedDecision> (STEWART, J., concurring).  Petitioner had become the accused, and the purpose of the interrogation was to "get him" to confess his guilt despite his constitutional right not to do so. At the time of his arrest and throughout the course of the interrogation, the police told petitioner that they had convincing evidence that he had fired the fatal shots.  Without informing him of his absolute right to remain silent in the face of this accusation, the police urged him to make a statement.  [5] As this Court observed many years ago: "It cannot be doubted that, placed in the position in which the accused was when the statement was made to him that the other suspected person had charged him with crime, the result was to produce upon his mind the fear that if he remained silent it would be considered an admission of guilt, and therefore render certain his being committed for trial as the guilty person, and it cannot be conceived that the converse impression would not also have naturally *486 arisen, that by denying there was hope of removing the suspicion from himself." Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532, 562 .  Petitioner, a layman, was undoubtedly unaware that under Illinois law an admission of "mere" complicity in the murder plot was legally as damaging as an admission of firing of the fatal shots.  Illinois v. Escobedo, 28 Ill. 2d 41 , 190 N. E. 2d 825 .

 The Court's opinion in Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , decided the same day, merely said that the "contention that petitioner had a constitutional right to confer with counsel is disposed of by Crooker v. California .  .  .  ." That case adds nothing, therefore, to Crooker .  In any event, to the extent that Cicenia or Crooker may be inconsistent with the principles announced today, they are not to be regarded as controlling.  [15] Nothing we have said today affects the powers of the police to investigate "an unsolved crime," Spano v. New York, <citedDecision>360 U. S. 315, 327</citedDecision> (STEWART, J., concurring), by gathering information from witnesses and by other "proper investigative efforts." Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 519 .  We hold only that when the process shifts from investigatory to accusatorywhen its focus is on the accused and its purpose is to elicit a confession our adversary system begins to operate, and, under the circumstances here, the accused must be permitted to consult with his lawyer.  The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is reversed and the case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  Reversed and remanded.  MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.  I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois on the basis of Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , *493 decided by this Court only six years ago.

 .  ." Ill. Rev. Stat. (1959), c. 38, § 477.  Repealed as of Jan. 1, 1964, by Act approved Aug. 14, 1963, H. B. No. 851.  [3]  The trial judge justified the handcuffing on the ground that it "is ordinary police procedure." [4]  Compare Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 515 (decided on the same day as the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court here), where we said: "Our conclusion is in no way foreclosed, as the State contends, by the fact that the state trial judge or the jury may have reached a different result on this issue.  "It is well settled that the duty of constitutional adjudication resting upon this Court requires that the question whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has been violated by admission into evidence of a coerced confession be the subject of an independent determination here, see, e. g., Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143, 147-148 ; `we cannot escape the responsibility of making our own examination of the record,' Spano v. New York, <citedDecision>360 U. S. 315, 316</citedDecision> ." (Emphasis in original.) [5]  Although there is testimony in the record that petitioner and his lawyer had previously discussed what petitioner should do in the event of interrogation, there is no evidence that they discussed what petitioner should, or could, do in the face of a false accusation that he had fired the fatal bullets.  [6]  The English Judges' Rules also recognize that a functional rather than a formal test must be applied and that, under circumstances such as those here, no special significance should be attached to formal indictment.  The applicable Rule does not permit the police to question an accused, except in certain extremely limited situations not relevant here, at any time after the defendant "has been charged or informed that he may be prosecuted.  " [1964] Crim. L. Rev. 166-170 (emphasis supplied).  Although voluntary statements obtained in violation of these rules are not automatically excluded from evidence the judge may, in the exercise of his discretion, exclude them.
