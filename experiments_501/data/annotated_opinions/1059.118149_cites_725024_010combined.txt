 App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a.  The District Court held that respondents had not shown that a difference in gasoline pricing would have increased the station’s sales; nor had they shown that State Oil had market power or that its pricing provisions affected competition in a relevant market.  Id., at 37a, 40a.  Accordingly, the District Court entered summary judgment for State Oil on respondents’ Sherman Act claim.  Id., at 40a.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.  <citedDecision>93 F. 3d 1358</citedDecision> (1996).  The court first noted that the agreement between respondents and State Oil did indeed fix maximum gasoline prices by making it “worthless” for respondents to exceed the suggested retail prices.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 1360</citedDecision> .  After reviewing legal and economic aspects of price fixing, the court concluded'that State Oil’s pricing scheme was a per se antitrust violation under Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra. Although the Court of Appeals characterized Albrecht as “unsound when decided” and “inconsistent with later decisions” of this Court, it felt constrained to follow that decision.  <citedDecision>93 F. 3d, at 1363</citedDecision> .  In light of Albrecht and Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328 (1990) (ARCO), the court found that respondents could have suffered antitrust injury from not being able to adjust gasoline prices.  We granted certiorari to consider two questions, whether State Oil’s conduct constitutes a per se violation of the Sherman Act and whether respondents are entitled to recover damages based on that conduct.  519 U. S. 1107 (1997).  *10 II A Although the Sherman Act, by its terms, prohibits every agreement “in restraint of trade,” this Court has long recognized that Congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints.  See, e. g., Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 342-343 (1982) (citing United States v. Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U. S. 505 (1898)).  As a consequence, most antitrust claims are analyzed under a “rule of reason,” according to which the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition, taking into account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, and the restraint’s history, nature, and effect.

 Our interpretation of the Sherman Act also incorporates the notion that condemnation of practices resulting in lower prices to consumers is “especially costly” because “cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition.” Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574, 594 (1986).  So informed, we find it difficult to maintain that vertically imposed maximum prices could harm consumers or competition to the extent necessary to justify their per se invalidation.  As Chief Judge Posner wrote for the Court of Appeals in this ease: “As for maximum resale price fixing, unless the supplier is a monopsonist he cannot squeeze his dealers’ margins *16 below a competitive level; the attempt to do so would just drive the dealers into the arms of a competing supplier.  A supplier might, however, fix a maximum resale price in order to prevent his dealers from exploiting a monopoly position.... [Sjuppose that State Oil, perhaps to encourage ... dealer services ... has spaced its dealers sufficiently far apart to limit competition among them (or even given each of them an exclusive territory); and suppose further that Union 76 is a sufficiently distinctive and popular brand to give the dealers in it at least a modicum of monopoly power.  Then State Oil might want to place a ceiling on the dealers’ resale prices in order to prevent them from exploiting that monopoly power folly.  It would do this not out of disinterested malice, but in its commercial self-interest.  The higher the price at which gasoline is resold, the smaller the volume sold, and so the lower the profit to the supplier if the higher profit per gallon at the higher price is being snared by the dealer.” <citedDecision>93 F. 3d, at 1362</citedDecision> .  See also R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 281-282 (1978) (“There could, of course, be no anticonsumer effect from [the type of price fixing considered in Albrecht], and one suspects that the paper has a legitimate interest in keeping subscriber prices down in order to increase circulation and maximize revenues from advertising”).  We recognize that the Albrecht decision presented a number of theoretical justifications for a per se rule against vertical maximum price fixing.  But criticism of those premises abounds.  The Albrecht decision was grounded in the fear that maximum price fixing by suppliers could interfere with dealer freedom.  390 U. S., at 152 .  In response, as one commentator has pointed out, “the ban on maximum resale price limitations declared in Albrecht in the name of ‘dealer freedom’ has actually prompted many suppliers to integrate forward into distribution, thus eliminating the very independent trader for whom Albrecht professed solicitude.” *17 8 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law ¶ 1635, p. 395 (1989) (hereinafter Areeda).

 In these circumstances, it is the retention of the rule of Albrecht , and not, as respondents would have it, the rule’s elimination, that lacks adequate justification.  See, e. g., GTE Sylvania, supra, at 58-59.  Respondents’ reliance on Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., 346 U. S. 356 (1953) (per curiam), and Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U. S. 258 (1972), is similarly misplaced, because those decisions are clearly inapposite, having to do with the antitrust exemption for professional baseball, which this Court has described as “an aberration ... resting] on a recognition and an acceptance of baseball’s unique characteristics and needs,” id., at 282 .  In the context of this ease, we infer little meaning from the fact that Congress has not reacted legislatively to Albrecht .  In any event, the history of various legislative proposals regarding price fixing seems neither clearly to support nor to denounce the per se rule of Albrecht .  Respondents are of course free to seek legislative protection from gasoline suppliers of the sort embodied in the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, 92 Stat. 322 , 15 U. S. C. § 2801 et seq. For the reasons we have noted, however, the remedy for respondents’ dispute with State Oil should not come in the form of a per se rule affecting the conduct of the entire marketplace.  *20 c Despite what Chief Judge Posner aptly described as Al-brechts "infirmities, [and] its increasingly wobbly, moth-eaten foundations,” <citedDecision>93 F. 3d, at 1363</citedDecision> , there remains the question whether Albrecht deserves continuing respect under the doctrine of stare decisis.  The Court of Appeals was correct in applying that principle despite disagreement with Al- brecht, for it is this Court’s prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.  We approach the reconsideration of decisions of this Court with the utmost caution.  Stare decisis reflects “a policy judgment that fin most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.’” Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997) (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting)).  It "is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).  This Court has expressed its reluctance to overrule decisions involving statutory interpretation, see, e. g., Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977), and has acknowledged that stare decisis concerns are at their acme in eases involving property and contract rights, see, e. g., Payne, 501 U. S., at 828 .  Both of those concerns are arguably relevant in this case. But “[sjtare decisis is not an inexorable command.” Ibid. In the area of antitrust law, there is a competing interest, well represented in this Court’s decisions, in recognizing and adapting to changed circumstances and the lessons of accumulated experience.
**Combined Opinion**
 Although the rule of Albrecht has been in effect for some time, the inquiry we must undertake requires considering “ ‘the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional *22 restraints in the American economy today.’” GTE Sylvania, supra, at 53, n. 21 (quoting Schwinn, 388 U. S., at 392 (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  As the Court noted in ARCO, 495 U. S., at 336, n. 6 , there has not been another ease since Albrecht in which this Court has “confronted an unadulterated vertical, maximum-price-fixing arrangement.” Now that we confront Albrecht directly, we find its conceptual foundations gravely weakened.  In overruling Albrecht , we of course do not hold that all vertical maximum price fixing is per se lawful.  Instead, vertical maximum priee fixing, like the majority of commercial arrangements subject-to the antitrust laws, should be evaluated under the rule of reason.  In our view, rule-of-reason analysis will effectively identify those situations in which vertical maximum price fixing amounts to anticompetitive conduct.  There remains the question whether respondents are entitled to recover damages based on State Oil’s conduct.  Although the Court of Appeals noted that “the district judge was right to conclude that if the rule of reason is applicable, Khan loses,” <citedDecision>93 F. 3d, at 1362</citedDecision> , its consideration of this case was necessarily premised on Albrecht's per se rule.  Under the circumstances, the matter should be reviewed by the Court of Appeals in the first instance.  We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the ease for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.
