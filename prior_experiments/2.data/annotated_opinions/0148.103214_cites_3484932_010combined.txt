**Combined Opinion**
It refers, footnote 6, to the decision of the Privy Council in Judges v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan (1937), 2 D.L.R. 209, construing income tax statutes of Saskatchewan. Neither the Dominion nor the Province has any law forbidding diminution of compensation of judges while in office and that decision has nothing to do with the question before us. The Australian and South African cases cited, footnotes 6 and 8, involved construction of income tax statutes under constitutions or charters created by legislative enactments and subject to authoritative interpretation or change by the local or British parliament. They shed no light upon the issue in this case. The opinion claims no support from any state court decision. The one it cites, footnote 8, that of the Maryland Court of Appeals in Gordy v. Dennis, <targetCase>5 A.2d 69</targetCase> , held that under a clause in the Constitution of Maryland like that in Art. III, § 1, the compensation of state judges may not be taxed. The opinion also cites, footnote 7, selected gainsaying writings of professors,  some are lawyers and some are not  but without specification of or reference to the reasons upon which their views rest. And in addition it cites notes published in law reviews, some signed and some not; presumably the latter were prepared by law students. The suggestion that, as citizens, judges are not immune from taxation begs the question here presented. The Constitution itself puts judges in a separate class, declaring that at stated times they shall receive for their services compensation which "shall not be diminished." And so their salaries are distinguished from income of *299 others.

REV. 291; 7 VA. L. REV. 69; 3 U. OF CHI. L. REV. 141. [8] The cases, pro and con, are collected in the recent dissenting opinion by Chief Judge Bond of the Court of Appeals of Maryland in Gordy v. Dennis, <targetCase>5 A.2d 69</targetCase> , 82. Particular attention should be called to the decision of the Supreme Court of South Africa, Krause v. Commissioner for Inland Revenue, [1929] So. Afr. R. (A.D.) 286, construing § 100 of the South Africa Act, which had taken over the identical clause from Article III, § 1, of our Constitution. [9] The provisions regarding security of salary had their source in the Act of Settlement of 1700, 12 & 13 Will. III , c. 2, § III, and the Act of 1760, 1 Geo. III, c. 23.
