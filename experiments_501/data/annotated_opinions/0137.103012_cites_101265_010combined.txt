**Combined Opinion**
 First.  Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 18 , held that federal courts exercising jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship need not, in matters of general jurisprudence, apply the unwritten law of the State as declared by its highest court; that they are free to exercise an independent judgment as to what the common law of the State is ย or should be; and that, as there stated by Mr. Justice Story: "the true interpretation of the thirty-fourth section limited its application to state laws strictly local, that is to say, to the positive statutes of the state, and the construction thereof adopted by the local tribunals, and to rights and titles to things having a permanent locality, such as the rights and titles to real estate, and other matters immovable and intraterritorial in their nature and character.  It never has been supposed by us, that the section did apply, or was intended to apply, to questions of a more general nature, not at all dependent upon local statutes or local usages of a fixed and permanent operation, as, for example, to the construction of ordinary contracts or other written instruments, and especially to questions of general commercial law, where the state tribunals are called upon to perform the like functions as ourselves, that is, to ascertain upon general reasoning and legal analogies, what is the true exposition of the contract or *72 instrument, or what is the just rule furnished by the principles of commercial law to govern the case." The Court in applying the rule of ยง 34 to equity cases, in Mason v. United States, 260 U.S. 545, 559 , said: "The statute, however, is merely declarative of the rule which would exist in the absence of the statute." [2] The federal courts assumed, in the broad field of "general law," the power to declare rules of decision which Congress was confessedly without power to enact as statutes.  Doubt was repeatedly expressed as to the correctness of the construction given ยง 34, [3] and as to the soundness of the rule which it introduced.  [4] But it was the more recent research of a competent scholar, who examined the original document, which established that the construction given to it by the Court was erroneous; and that the purpose of the section was merely to make certain that, in all matters except those in which some federal law is controlling, *73 the federal courts exercising jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship cases would apply as their rules of decision the law of the State, unwritten as well as written.  [5] Criticism of the doctrine became widespread after the decision of Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., <citedDecision>276 U.S. 518</citedDecision> .  [6] There, Brown and Yellow, a Kentucky corporation owned by Kentuckians, and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, also a Kentucky corporation, wished that the former should have the exclusive privilege of soliciting passenger and baggage transportation at the Bowling Green, Kentucky, railroad station; and that the Black and White, a competing Kentucky corporation, should be prevented from interfering with that privilege.  Knowing that such a contract would be void under the common law of Kentucky, it was arranged that the Brown and Yellow reincorporate under the law of Tennessee, and that the contract with the railroad should be executed there.  The suit was then brought by the Tennessee corporation in the federal court for western Kentucky to enjoin competition by the Black and White; an injunction issued by the District Court *74 was sustained by the Court of Appeals; and this Court, citing many decisions in which the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson had been applied, affirmed the decree.  Second.  Experience in applying the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson , had revealed its defects, political and social; and the benefits expected to flow from the rule did not accrue.  Persistence of state courts in their own opinions on questions of common law prevented uniformity; [7] and the impossibility of discovering a satisfactory line of demarcation between the province of general law and that of local law developed a new well of uncertainties.
**Combined Opinion**
 So far as appears, it was not questioned until more than 50 years later, and then by a single judge. [1] Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U.S. 368 , 390.  In that case, Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the Court, truly said (p. 373): "Whatever differences of opinion may have been expressed, have not been on the question whether a matter of general law should be settled by the independent judgment of this court, rather than through an adherence to the decisions of the state courts, but upon the other question, whether a given matter is one of local or of general law." And since that decision, the division of opinion in this Court has been one of the same character as it was before.  In 1910, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for himself and two other Justices, dissented from the holding that a *85 court of the United States was bound to exercise its own independent judgment in the construction of a conveyance made before the state courts had rendered an authoritative decision as to its meaning and effect.  Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U.S. 349 .  But that dissent accepted (p. 371) as "settled" the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson , and insisted (p. 372) merely that the case under consideration was by nature and necessity peculiarly local.  Thereafter, as before, the doctrine was constantly applied.  [2] In Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., <citedDecision>276 U.S. 518</citedDecision> , three judges dissented.  The writer of the dissent, Mr. Justice Holmes, said, however (p. 535): "I should leave Swift v. Tyson undisturbed, as I indicated in Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co ., but I would not allow it to spread the assumed dominion into new fields." No more unqualified application of the doctrine can be found than in decisions of this Court speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes.  United Zinc Co. v. Britt, 258 U.S. 268 .  Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Goodman, 275 U.S. 66, 70 .  Without in the slightest departing from that doctrine, but implicitly applying it, the strictness of the rule laid down in the Goodman case was somewhat ameliorated by Pokora v. Wabash Ry. Co., 292 U.S. 98 .  Whenever possible, consistently with standards sustained by reason and authority constituting the general law, this Court has followed applicable decisions of state courts.
**Combined Opinion**
 As the majority opinion shows, by its reference to Mr. Warren's researches and the first quotation from Mr. Justice Holmes, that this Court is now of the view that "laws" includes "decisions," it is unnecessary to go further and declare that the "course pursued" was "unconstitutional," instead of merely erroneous.  The "unconstitutional" course referred to in the majority opinion is apparently the ruling in Swift v. Tyson that the supposed omission of Congress to legislate as to the effect of decisions leaves federal courts free to interpret general law for themselves.  I am not at all sure whether, in the absence of federal statutory direction, federal courts would be compelled to follow state decisions.  There was sufficient doubt about the matter in 1789 to induce the first Congress to legislate.  No former opinions of this Court have passed upon it.  Mr. Justice Holmes evidently saw nothing "unconstitutional" which required the overruling of Swift v. Tyson , for he said in the very opinion quoted by the majority, "I should leave Swift v. Tyson undisturbed, as I indicated in Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co ., but I would not allow it to spread the assumed dominion into new fields." Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., <citedDecision>276 U.S. 518, 535</citedDecision> .  If the opinion commits this Court to the position that the Congress is without power to declare what rules of substantive law shall govern the federal courts, *92 that conclusion also seems questionable.  The line between procedural and substantive law is hazy but no one doubts federal power over procedure.  Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1 .  The Judiciary Article and the "necessary and proper" clause of Article One may fully authorize legislation, such as this section of the Judiciary Act.  In this Court, stare decisis, in statutory construction, is a useful rule, not an inexorable command.  Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393 , dissent, p. 406, note 1.  Compare Read v. Bishop of Lincoln, [1892] A.C. 644, 655; London Street Tramways Co. v. London County Council, [1898] A.C. 375, 379.  It seems preferable to overturn an established construction of an Act of Congress, rather than, in the circumstances of this case, to interpret the Constitution.  Cf. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366 .  There is no occasion to discuss further the range or soundness of these few phrases of the opinion.  It is sufficient now to call attention to them and express my own non-acquiescence.  NOTES [1] 16 Pet. 1 (1842).  Leading cases applying the doctrine are collected in Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., <citedDecision>276 U.S. 518, 530, 531</citedDecision> .  Dissent from its application or extension was expressed as early as 1845 by Mr. Justice McKinley (and Mr. Chief Justice Taney) in Lane v. Vick, 3 How. 464, 477 .  Dissenting opinions were also written by Mr. Justice Daniel in Rowan v. Runnels, 5 How. 134, 140 ; by Mr. Justice Nelson in Williamson v. Berry, 8 How. 495, 550, 558 ; by Mr. Justice Campbell in Pease v. Peck, 18 How. 595, 599, 600 ; and by Mr. Justice Miller in Gelpcke v. City of Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, 207 , and Butz v. City of Muscatine, 8 Wall. 575, 585 .  Vigorous attack upon the entire doctrine was made by Mr. Justice Field in Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U.S. 368 , 390, and by Mr. Justice Holmes in Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U.S. 349, 370 , and in the Taxicab case, <citedDecision>276 U.S. at 532</citedDecision> .  [2]   In Hawkins v. Barney's Lessee, 5 Pet. 457, 464 , it was stated that ยง 34 "has been uniformly held to be no more than a declaration of what the law would have been without it: to wit, that the lex loci must be the governing rule of private right, under whatever jurisdiction private right comes to be examined."

 [8]   Compare 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (rev. ed. 1935) 89: "Probably no decision of the Court has ever given rise to more uncertainty as to legal rights; and though doubtless intended to promote uniformity in the operation of business transactions, its chief effect has been to render it difficult for business men to know in advance to what particular topic the Court would apply the doctrine.  .  .  ." The Federal Digest, through the 1937 volume, lists nearly 1000 decisions involving the distinction between questions of general and of local law. [9]   It was even possible for a non-resident plaintiff defeated on a point of law in the highest court of a State nevertheless to win out by taking a nonsuit and renewing the controversy in the federal court.

 [21]   Thus, bills which would abrogate the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson have been introduced.  S. 4333, 70th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. 96, 71st Cong., 1st Sess.; H.R. 8094, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. See also Mills, supra note 4, at 68-69; Dobie, supra note 6, at 241; Frankfurter, supra note 6, at 530; Campbell, supra note 6, at 811.  State statutes on conflicting questions of "general law" have also been suggested.  See Heiskell, supra note 4, at 760; Dawson, supra note 6; Dobie, supra note 6, at 241.  [22]   The doctrine has not been without defenders.  See Eliot, The Common Law of the Federal Courts (1902) 36 Am. L. Rev. 498, 523-25; A.B. Parker, The Common Law Jurisdiction of the United States Courts (1907) 17 Yale L.J. 1 ; Schofield, Swift v. Tyson: Uniformity of Judge-Made State Law in State and Federal Courts (1910) 4 Ill. L.

[24]   Tompkins also contended that the alleged rule of the Falchetti case is not in any event applicable here because he was struck at the intersection of the longitudinal pathway and a transverse crossing.  The court below found it unnecessary to consider this contention, and we leave the question open.  [1]   Mr. Justice Field filed a dissenting opinion, several sentences of which are quoted in the decision just announced.  The dissent failed to impress any of his associates.  It assumes that adherence to ยง 34 as construed involves a supervision over legislative or judicial action of the states.  There is no foundation for that suggestion.
