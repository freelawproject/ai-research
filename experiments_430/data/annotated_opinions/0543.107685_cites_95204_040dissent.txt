 Instead, the word turns out to mean “old,” “much praised,” and “found in the Bill of Rights.” The definition of “fundamental” thus turns out to be circular.  II.  Since, as I see it, the Court has not even come to grips with the issues in this case, it is necessary to start from the beginning.  When a criminal defendant contends that his state conviction lacked “due process of law,” the question before this Court, in my view, is whether he was denied any element of fundamental procedural fairness.  Believing, as I do, that due process is an evolving concept and that old principles are subject to re-evaluation in light of later experience, I think it appropriate to deal on its merits with the question whether Louisiana denied *184 appellant due process of law when it tried him for simple assault without a jury.  The obvious starting place is the fact that this Court has, in the past, held that trial by jury is not a requisite of criminal due process.  In the leading case, Maxwell v. Dow, <citedDecision>176 U. S. 581</citedDecision> , Mr. Justice Peckham wrote as follows for the Court: 24 “Trial by jury has never been affirmed to be a necessary requisite of due process of law. .  .  .  .  .  The right to be proceeded against only by indictment, and the right to a trial by twelve jurors, are of the same nature, and are subject to the same judgment, and the people in the several States have the same right to provide by their organic law for the change of both or either.  .  .  .  [T]he State has full control over the procedure in its courts, both in civil and criminal cases, subject only to the qualification that such procedure must not work a denial of fundamental rights or conflict with specific and applicable provisions of the Federal Constitution.  The legislation in question is not, in our opinion, open to either of these objections.” <citedDecision>Id., at 603-605</citedDecision> .  *185 In Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197 , the question was whether the Territory of Hawaii could continue its pre-annexation procedure of permitting conviction by non-unanimous juries.  The Congressional Resolution of Annexation had provided that municipal legislation of Hawaii that was not contrary to the United States Constitution could remain in force.  The Court interpreted the resolution to mean only that those requirements of the Constitution that were “fundamental” would be binding in the Territory.  After concluding that a municipal statute allowing a conviction of treason on circumstantial evidence would violate a “fundamental” guarantee of the Constitution, the Court continued: “We would even go farther, and say that most, if not all, the privileges and immunities contained in the bill of rights of the Constitution were intended to apply from the moment of annexation; but we place our decision of this case upon the ground that the two rights alleged to be violated in this case [Sixth Amendment jury trial and grand jury indictment] are not fundamental in their nature, but concern merely a method of procedure which sixty years of practice had shown to be suited to the conditions of the islands, and well calculated to conserve the rights of their citizens to their lives, their property and their well-being.” Id., at 217-218 .  Numerous other cases in this Court have assumed that jury trial is not fundamental to ordered liberty.  25 Although it is of course open to this Court to reexamine these decisions, I can see no reason why they *186 should now be overturned.

 .” Ante, at 158, n. 30.  These examples illustrate a major danger of the “incorporation” approach — that provisions of the Bill of Rights may be watered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity.  Cf. my concurring opinion in Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 44 .  Mr. Justice White alluded to this problem in his dissenting opinion in Malloy v. Hogan, supra, at 38 .  Criminal Justice Act of 1967, § 13.  E. g., Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540 ; District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 ; District of Columbia v. Colts, 282 U. S. 63 .  The precise issue in <citedDecision>Maxwell</citedDecision> was whether a jury of eight rather than 12 jurors could be employed in criminal prosecutions in Utah. The Court held that this was permissible because the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the States to provide trial by jury at all. The Court seems to think this was dictum.  As a technical matter, however, a statement that is critical to the chain of reasoning by which a result is in fact reached does not become dictum simply because a later court can imagine a totally different way of deciding the case. See Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225 U. S. 167, 176 , citing <citedDecision>Maxwell</citedDecision> for the proposition that “the requirement of due process does not deprive a State of the power to dispense with jury trial altogether.” E. g., Irvin v. Dowd, supra, at 721 ; Fay v. New York, 332 U. S. 261, 288 ; Palko v. Connecticut, supra, at 325; Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 ; Brown v. New Jersey, 175 U. S. 172, 175 ; Missouri v. Lewis, supra, at 31 .  E. g., Deady, Trial by Jury, 17 Am. L. Rev. 398, 399-400 (1883): “Still in these days of progress and experiment, when everything is on trial at the bar of human reason or conceit, it is quite the fashion to speak of jury trial as something that has outlived its usefulness.  Intelligent and well-meaning people often sneer at it as an awkward and useless impediment to the speedy and correct administration of justice, and a convenient loop-hole for the escape of powerful and popular rogues.  Considering the kind of jury trials we sometimes have in the United States, it must be admitted that this criticism is not without foundation.” See generally Kalven, Memorandum Regarding Jury System, printed in Hearings on Recording of Jury Deliberations before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 63-81.  In particular, “the debate has been going on for a long time (at least since 1780) and the arguments which were advanced pro and con haven’t changed much in the interim.  Nor, contrary to my first impression, does there seem to be any particular period in which the debate grows hotter or colder.  It has always been a hot debate.” Id., at 63 .
