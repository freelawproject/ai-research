**Combined Opinion**
Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., 265 U.S. 298 , 307-309. Peoples Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 270 U.S. 550 , 554. Public Util. Comm. v. Attleboro Co., 273 U.S. 83 , 89. But when the gas passes from the distribution lines into the supply mains, it necessarily is relieved of nearly all the pressure put upon it at the stations of the producing *471 companies, its volume thereby is expanded to many times what it was while in the high pressure interstate transmission lines, and it is divided into the many thousand relatively tiny streams that enter the small service lines connecting such mains with the pipes on the consumers' premises. So segregated the gas in such service lines and pipes remains in readiness or moves forward to serve as needed. The treatment and division of the large compressed volume of gas is like the breaking of an original package, after shipment in interstate commerce, in order that its contents may be treated, prepared for sale and sold at retail. State v. Flannelly, 96 Kan. 372 , 383-384; 152 P. 22 ; W. Va. & Md. Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv.
