**Combined Opinion**
Mr. Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court. Once again we are presented with “ 'the perennial problem of the validity of a state tax for the privilege of carrying on, within a state, certain activities’ related to a corporation’s operation of an interstate business.” Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 100, 101</citedDecision> (1975), quoting Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, 335 U. S. 80, 85 (1948).  The issue in this case is whether Mississippi runs afoul of the Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, when it applies the tax it imposes on “the privilege of .  .  .  doing business” within the State to appellant’s activity in interstate commerce.  The Supreme Court of Mississippi unanimously sustained the tax against *275 appellant’s constitutional challenge.  330 So. 2d 268 (1976).
**Combined Opinion**
 On the day it announced Railway Express II, the Court further confirmed that a State, with proper drafting, may tax exclusively interstate commerce so long as the tax does not create any effect forbidden by the Commerce Clause.  In Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959), the Court held that net income from the interstate operations of a foreign corporation may be subjected to state taxation, provided the levy is not discriminatory and is properly apportioned to local activities within the taxing State forming sufficient nexus to support the tax. Limited in that way, the tax could be levied even though the income was generated exclusively by interstate sales.  Spector was distinguished, briefly and in passing, as a case in which “the incidence” of the tax “was the privilege of doing business.” 358 U. S., at 464.  Thus, applying the rule of Northwestern Cement to the facts of Spector, it is clear that Connecticut could have taxed the apportioned net income derived from the exclusively interstate commerce.  It could not, however, tax the “privilege” of doing business as measured by the apportioned net income.  The reason for attaching constitutional significance to a semantic difference is difficult to discern.  The unsatisfactory operation of the Spector rule is well demonstrated by our recent case of Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 100</citedDecision> (1975).  Colonial was a Delaware corporation with an interstate pipeline running through Louisiana for approximately 258 miles.  It maintained a work force and pumping stations in Louisiana to keep the pipeline flowing, but it did no intrastate business in that State.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 101-102</citedDecision> .  In 1962, Louisiana imposed on Colonial a franchise tax for “the privilege of carrying on or doing business” in the State.  The Louisiana Court of Appeal invalidated the *286 tax as violative of the rule of Spector.  Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Mouton, 228 So. 2d 718 (1969).  The Supreme Court of Louisiana refused review.  255 La. 474 , 231 So. 2d 393 (1970).  The Louisiana Legislature, perhaps recognizing that it had run afoul of a rule of words rather than a rule of substance, then redrafted the statute to levy the tax, as an alternative incident, on the “qualification to carry on or do business in this state or the actual doing of business within this state in a corporate form.” Again, the Court of Appeal held the tax unconstitutional as applied to the appellant.  Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Agerton, 275 So. 2d 834 (1973).  But this time the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld the new tax. 289 So. 2d 93 (1974) By a 7-to-1 vote, this Court affirmed.  No question had been raised as to the propriety of the apportionment of the tax, and no claim was made that the tax was discriminatory.  <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 101</citedDecision> .  The Court noted that the tax was imposed on that aspect of interstate commerce to which the State bore a special relation, and that the State bestowed powers, privileges, and benefits sufficient to support a tax on doing business in the corporate form in Louisiana.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 109</citedDecision> .  Accordingly, on the authority of Memphis Gas, the tax was held to be constitutional.  The Court distinguished Spector on the familiar ground that it involved a tax on the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce, while the Louisiana Legislature, in contrast, had worded the statute at issue “narrowly to confine the impost to one related to appellant’s activities within the State in the corporate form.” <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 113-114</citedDecision> .  13 *287 While refraining from overruling Spector, the Court noted: “[D]ecisions of this Court, particularly during recent decades, have sustained nondiscriminatory, properly apportioned state corporate taxes upon foreign corporations doing an exclusively interstate business when the tax is related to a corporation’s local activities and the State has provided benefits and protections for those activities for which it is justified in asking a fair and reasonable return.” <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 108</citedDecision> .  One commentator concluded: “After reading Colonial, only the most sanguine taxpayer would conclude that the Court maintains a serious belief in the doctrine that the privilege of doing interstate business is immune from state taxation.” Hellerstein, State Taxation of Interstate Business and the Supreme Court, 1974 Term: Standard Pressed Steel and Colonial Pipeline, 62 Va. L. Rev. 149 , 188 (1976).  14 III In this case, of course, we are confronted with a situation like that presented in Spector.  The tax is labeled a privilege tax “for the privilege of .  .  .  doing business” in Mississippi, § 10105 of the State’s 1942 Code, as amended, and the activity taxed is, or has been assumed to be, interstate commerce.  We note again that no claim is made that the activity is not sufficiently connected to the State to justify a tax, or that the tax is not fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer, or that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce, or that the tax is not fairly apportioned.  *288 The view of the Commerce Clause that gave rise to the rule of Spector perhaps was not without some substance.  Nonetheless, the possibility of defending it in the abstract does not alter the fact that the Court has rejected the proposition that interstate commerce is immune from state taxation: “It is a truism that the mere act of carrying on business in interstate commerce does not exempt a corporation from state taxation.  'It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business.’ Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938).” Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 108</citedDecision> .  Not only has the philosophy underlying the rule been rejected, but the rule itself has been stripped of any practical significance.  If Mississippi had called its tax one on “net income” or on the “going concern value” of appellant’s business, the Spector rule could not invalidate it.  There is no economic consequence that follows necessarily from the use of the particular words, “privilege of doing business,” and a focus on that formalism merely obscures the question whether the tax produces a forbidden effect.  Simply put, the Spector rule does not address the problems with which the Commerce Clause is concerned.  15 Accordingly, we now reject the rule of *289 Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O’Connor , that a state tax on the “privilege of doing business” is per se unconstitutional when it is applied to interstate commerce, and that case is overruled.  There being no objection to Mississippi’s tax on appellant except that it was imposed on nothing other than the “privilege of doing business” that is interstate, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi is affirmed.
**Combined Opinion**
 11 A consistent application of the doctrine of immunity for interstate commerce, of course, would have necessitated overruling the cases approved by the Freeman Court that upheld taxes whose burden, although indirect, fell on interstate commerce.  12 In arriving at this conclusion, the dissent relied upon a construction of a stipulation entered into by the parties, 335 U. S., at 100-101 , and upon an independent review of the record.  The plurality rejected the dissent’s reading of the stipulation and noted, in addition, that the question presented in the petition for certiorari did not raise a claim that the State was providing no service for which it could ask recompense.  Id., at 83-84 .  The plurality then relied on the Supreme Court of Mississippi’s holding that the State did provide protection that could properly be the subject of a tax. 13 Five Members of the Court joined in the opinion distinguishing Spector.  Two concurred in the judgment, but viewed Spector as indistinguishable and would have overruled it.  <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 114-116</citedDecision> .  One also viewed Spector as indistinguishable, but felt that it was an established precedent until forthrightly overruled.  <citedDecision>
    Id.,
   
   at 116</citedDecision> .  Mr. Justice Douglas took no part.  14 Less charitably put: “In light of the expanding scope of the state taxing power over interstate commerce, Spector is an anachronism.  .  .  .  Continued adherence to Spector, especially after Northwestern States Portland Cement, cannot be justified.” Comment, Pipelines, Privileges and Labels: Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 70 Nw. U. L. Rev. 835 , 854 (1975).
