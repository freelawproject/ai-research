 6 The Court’s opinion relies on Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, 288 U. S. 344 (1933); however, examination of that case reveals that it gives very little support for the broad doctrine Yellow Cab has been thought to announce.  On the contrary, the language of Chief Justice Hughes speaking for the Court in Appalachian Coals supports a contrary conclusion.  After observing that “[t]he restrictions the Act imposes are not mechanical or artificial,” 288 U. S., at 360 , he went on to state: *763 “The argument that integration may be considered a normal expansion of business, while a combination of independent producers in a common selling agency should be treated as abnormal — that one is a legitimate enterprise and the other is not — makes but an artificial distinction.  The Anti-Trust Act aims at substance.” Id., at 377 .  7 As we shall see, infra, at 771-774, it is the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine itself that “makes but an artificial distinction” at the expense of substance.  The ambiguity of the Yellow Cab holding yielded the one case giving support to the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine.  8 In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., <citedDecision>340 U. S. 211</citedDecision> (1951), the Court held that two wholly owned subsidiaries of a liquor distiller were guilty under § 1 of the Sherman Act for jointly refusing to supply a wholesaler who declined to abide by a maximum resale pricing scheme.  The Court offhandedly dismissed the defendants’ argument *764 that “their status as ‘mere instrumentalities of a single manufacturing-merchandizing unit’ makes it impossible for them to have conspired in a manner forbidden by the Sherman Act.” Id., at 215.  With only a citation to Yellow Cab and no further analysis, the Court stated that the “suggestion runs counter to our past decisions that common ownership and control does not liberate corporations from the impact of the antitrust laws” and stated that this rule was “especially applicable” when defendants “hold themselves out as competitors.” <citedDecision>340 U. S., at 215</citedDecision> .  Unlike the Yellow Cab passage, this language does not pertain to corporations whose initial affiliation was itself unlawful.  In straying beyond Yellow Cab, the Kiefer-Stewart Court failed to confront the anomalies an intra-enterprise doctrine entails.  It is relevant nonetheless that, were the ease decided today, the same result probably could be justified on the ground that the subsidiaries conspired with wholesalers other than the plaintiff.  9 An intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine thus would no longer be necessary to a finding of liability on the facts of Kiefer-Stewart.  Later cases invoking the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine do little more than cite Yellow Cab or Kiefer-Stewart, and in none of the cases was the doctrine necessary to the result reached.  Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 593 (1951), involved restrictive horizontal agree *765 ments between an American corporation and two foreign corporations in which it owned 30 and 50 percent interests respectively.
**Lead Opinion**
 The economic, legal, or other considerations that lead corporate management to choose one structure over the other are not relevant to whether the enterprise’s conduct seriously threatens competition.  19 Rather, a corporation may adopt the subsidiary form of organization for valid management and related purposes.  Separate incorporation may im *773 prove management, avoid special tax problems arising from multistate operations, or serve other legitimate interests.  20 Especially in view of the increasing complexity of corporate operations, a business enterprise should be free to structure itself in ways that serve efficiency of control, economy of operations, and other factors dictated by business judgment without increasing its exposure to antitrust liability.  Because there is nothing inherently anticompetitive about a corporation’s decision to create a subsidiary, the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine “impose[s] grave legal consequences upon organizational distinctions that are of de minimis meaning and effect.” Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler & Smith Citrus Products Co., 370 U. S. 19, 29 (1962).  21 If antitrust liability turned on the garb in which a corporate subunit was clothed, parent corporations would be encouraged to convert subsidiaries into unincorporated divisions.  Indeed, this is precisely what the Seagram company did after this Court’s decision in Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., <citedDecision>340 U. S. 211</citedDecision> (1951).  22 Such an *774 incentive serves no valid antitrust goals but merely deprives consumers and producers of the benefits that the subsidiary form may yield.  The error of treating a corporate division differently from a wholly owned subsidiary is readily seen from the facts of this case. Regal was operated as an unincorporated division of Lear Siegler for four years before it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Copperweld.  Nothing in this record indicates any meaningful difference between Regal’s operations as a division and its later operations as a separate corporation.  Certainly nothing suggests that Regal was a greater threat to competition as a subsidiary of Copperweld than as a division of Lear Siegler.  Under either arrangement, Regal might have acted to bar a new competitor from entering the market.  In one case it could have relied on economic power from other quarters of the Lear Siegler corporation; instead it drew on the strength of its separately incorporated parent, Copperweld.

 Schine Chain Theatres, Inc. v. United States, 334 U. S. 110 (1948); United States v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100 (1948).  Griffith simply assumed that the companies were capable of conspiring with each other; Schine cited Yellow Cab and Crescent Amusement for the proposition, 334 U. S., at 116.  In both cases, however, an intra-enterprise conspiracy holding was unnecessary not only because the Court found a §2 violation, but also because the affiliated exhibitors had conspired with independent film distributors.  See ibid.; Griffith, supra, at 103 .  n. 6.  109.  Although the plaintiff apparently never acquiesced in the resale price maintenance scheme, Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 182 F. 2d 228, 231 (CA7 1950), rev’d, <citedDecision>340 U. S. 211</citedDecision> (1951), one of the subsidiaries did gain the compliance of other wholesalers after once terminating them for refusing to abide by the pricing scheme.  See 182 F. 2d, at 231 ; <citedDecision>340 U. S., at 213</citedDecision> .  A theory of combination between the subsidiaries and the wholesalers could now support § 1 relief, whether or not it could have when Kiefer-Stewart was decided.  See Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U. S. 145, 149-150 , and n. 6 (1968); United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U. S. 29 (1960).  See United States v. Timken Roller Bearing Co., 83 F. Supp. 284, 311-312 (ND Ohio 1949), aff’d as modified, 341 U. S. 593 (1951).  The agreement of an individual named Dewar, who owned 24 and 50 percent of the foreign corporations respectively, was apparently required for the American defendant to have its way.  For almost 20 years before they became affiliated by stock ownership, two of the corporations had been party to the sort of restrictive agreements the Timken Court condemned.  Three Justices upholding antitrust liability were of the view that Timken’s “interests in the [foreign] companies were obtained as part of a plan to promote the illegal trade restraints” and that the “intercorporate relationship” was “the core of the conspiracy.” Id., at 600-601 .

 But the relief need not, and under these facts should not, be so restricted [to divestiture].  The fact that the companies were affiliated induced joint action and agreement.  Common control was one of the instruments in bringing about unity of purpose and unity of action and in making the conspiracy effective.  If that affiliation continues, *781 there will be tempting opportunity for these exhibitors to continue to act in combination against the independents.” 323 U. S., at 189-190 (emphasis supplied).  Similarly, in Schine Chain Theatres, Inc. v. United States, 334 U. S. 110 (1948), the Court held that concerted action by parents and subsidiaries constituted an unlawful conspiracy.  3 That was also the holding in United States v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100, 109 (1948).  The majority’s observation that in these cases there were alternative grounds that could have been used to reach the same result, ante, at 763, n. 8, disguises neither the fact that the holding that actually appears in these opinions rests on conspiracy between affiliated entities, nor that today’s holding is inconsistent with what was actually held in these cases. In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., <citedDecision>340 U. S. 211</citedDecision> (1951), the Court’s holding was plain and unequivocal: *782 This holding is so clear that even the Court, which is not wanting for inventiveness in its reading of the prior cases, cannot explain it away.  The Court suggests only that today Kiefer-Stewart might be decided on alternative grounds, ante, at 764, ignoring the fact that today’s holding is inconsistent with the ground on which the case actually was decided.  4 *781 “Respondents next suggest that their status as ‘mere in-strumentalities of a single manufacturing-merchandizing unit’ makes it impossible for them to have conspired in a manner forbidden by the Sherman Act.  But this suggestion runs counter to our past decisions that common ownership and control does not liberate corporations from the impact of the antitrust laws.  E. g. United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218 .  The rule is especially applicable where, as here, respondents hold themselves out as competitors.” Id., at 215.  *782 A construction of the statute that reaches agreements between corporate parents and subsidiaries was again embraced by the Court in Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 598 (1951), 5 and Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U. S. 134 (1968).

 Excessive advertising in the cereal, drug, or detergent industries, annual style changes in the auto industry, and other such practices could be reached as soon as they threatened to inhibit competition; there would be no need to wait until a ‘dangerous probability’ of monopoly had been reached, the requirement under Section 2 ‘attempt’ doctrine.  Nor would a single firm restraint of trade rule be overbroad.  It would in no way threaten single firm activity — setting a price, deciding what market it would deal in, or the like — which did not threaten competitive conditions.” L. Sullivan, swpra n. 9, § 114, at 324 (footnotes omitted).  This was the case in Kiefer-Stewart, for example.  Seagram had refused to sell liquor to Kiefer-Stewart unless it agreed to an illegal resale price maintenance scheme.  Kiefer-Stewart refused to agree, and as a result was injured by losing access to Seagram’s products.  See <citedDecision>340 U. S., at 213</citedDecision> .  See United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 588-593 (1981) (discussing congressional findings underlying the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970).  Section 1 of the Sherman Act has on occasion been used against *792 various types of racketeering activity.  See Hartwell, Criminal RICO and Antitrust, 52 Antitrust L. J. 311, 312-313 (1983); McLaren, Antitrust and Competition — Review of the Past Year and Suggestions for the Future, in New York State Bar Assn., 1971 Antitrust Law Symposium 1, 3 (1971).

Professor Sullivan elaborates: “Picture, at one end of the spectrum, a family business which operates one retail store in each of three or four adjacent communities.  All of the stores are managed as a unit by one individual, the founder of the business who sets policy, does all the buying, decides on all the advertising, sets prices, and hires and fires all employees other than family members.

 On the contrary, the language of Chief Justice Hughes speaking for the Court in Appalachian Coals supports a contrary conclusion.  After observing that "[t]he restrictions the Act imposes are not mechanical or artificial," 288 U.

 The statement may also envision merely the limited rule in Yellow Cab pertaining to acquisitions that are themselves anticompetitive.  [8]  In two cases decided soon after Yellow Cab on facts similar to Crescent Amusement, see n. 6, supra, affiliated film exhibitors were found to have conspired in violation of § 1.  Schine Chain Theatres, Inc. v. United States, 334 U. S. 110 (1948); United States v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100 (1948).  Griffith simply assumed that the companies were capable of conspiring with each other; Schine cited Yellow Cab and Crescent Amusement for the proposition, 334 U. S., at 116.

**Combined Opinion**
 Nor would a single firm restraint of trade rule be overbroad.  It would in no way threaten single firm activity  setting a price, deciding what market it would deal in, or the like  which did not threaten competitive conditions." L. Sullivan, supra n. 9, § 114, at 324 (footnotes omitted).  [23]  This was the case in Kiefer-Stewart, for example.  Seagram had refused to sell liquor to Kiefer-Stewart unless it agreed to an illegal resale price maintenance scheme.  Kiefer-Stewart refused to agree, and as a result was injured by losing access to Seagram's products.  See <citedDecision>340 U. S., at 213</citedDecision> .  [24]  See United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 588-593 (1981) (discussing congressional findings underlying the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970).  Section 1 of the Sherman Act has on occasion been used against various types of racketeering activity.  See Hartwell, Criminal RICO and Antitrust, 52 Antitrust L. J. 311, 312-313 (1983); McLaren, Antitrust and Competition  Review of the Past Year and Suggestions for the Future, in New York State Bar Assn., 1971 Antitrust Law Symposium 1, 3 (1971).

Professor Sullivan elaborates: "Picture, at one end of the spectrum, a family business which operates one retail store in each of three or four adjacent communities.  All of the stores are managed as a unit by one individual, the founder of the business who sets policy, does all the buying, decides on all the advertising, sets prices, and hires and fires all employees other than family members.
