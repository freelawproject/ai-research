 In this case, our inquiry under Agostini’s purpose and effect test is a narrow one.  Because respondents do not challenge the District Court’s holding that Chapter 2 has a secular purpose, and because the Fifth Circuit also did not question that holding, ef.  151 F. 3d, at 369, n. 17 , we will consider only Chapter 2’s effect.  Further, in determining that effect, we will consider only the first two Agostini criteria, since neither respondents nor the Fifth Circuit has questioned the District Court’s holding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a, that Chapter 2 does not create an excessive entanglement.  Considering Chapter 2 in light of our more recent ease law, we conclude that it neither results in religious indoctrination by the government nor defines its recipients by reference to religion.  We therefore hold that Chapter 2 is not a “law respecting an establishment of religion.” In so holding, we acknowledge what both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits saw was inescapable — Meek and Wolman are anomalies in our case law. We therefore conclude that they are no longer good law. *809 A As we indicated in Agostini , and have indicated elsewhere, the question whether governmental aid to religious schools results in governmental indoctrination is ultimately a question whether any religious indoctrination that occurs in those schools could reasonably be attributed to governmental action.  See Agostini, supra, at 226 (presence of sign-language interpreter in Catholic school “ ‘cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking’ ” (quoting Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 ) (emphasis added in Agostini))', 521 U. S., at 230 (question is whether “any use of [governmental] aid to indoctrinate religion could be attributed to the State”); see also Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 841-842; Witters v. Washington Dept., of Servs. for Blind, <citedDecision>474 U. S. 481, 488-489</citedDecision> (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397 (1983); cf. Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 337 (1987) (“For a law to have forbidden 'effects’ under Lemon, it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through its own activities and influence”).  We have also indicated that the answer to the question of indoctrination will resolve the question whether a program of educational aid “subsidizes” religion, as our religion eases use that term. See Agostini , 521U.  S., at 230-231; see also id., at 230 .  In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, we have consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion.  If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government.  For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question.  If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any par *810 ticular indoctrination.

 1988), and that could lead to a program inadvertently favoring one religion or favoring religious private schools in general over nonreligious ones.  The principles of neutrality and private choice, and their relationship to each other, were prominent not only in Agos- *811 Uni, supra, at 225-226, 228, 280-282, but also in Zobrest, Witters, and Mueller .  5 The heart of our reasoning in Zobrest , upholding governmental provision of a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at his Catholic high school, was as follows: “The service at issue in this ease is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as ‘disabled’ under the [statute], without regard to the ‘sectarian-nonseetarian, or publie-nonpublic nature’ of the school the child attends.  By according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents.  In other words, because the [statute] creates no financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school, an interpreter’s presence there cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking.” 509 U. S., at 10 .  As this passage indicates, the private choices helped to ensure neutrality, and neutrality and private choices together eliminated any possible attribution to the government even when the interpreter translated classes on Catholic doctrine.  <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Mueller employed similar reasoning.  In <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from including within a neutral program providing tuition payments for vocational rehabilitation a blind person studying at a Christian college to become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.  We explained: “Any aid .  .  .  that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.  Washington’s *812 program is made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited and .  .. creates no financial incentive for students to undertake sectarian education.  .  .  .  [T]he fact that aid goes to individuals means that the decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not by the State.  “[I]t does not seem appropriate to view any aid ultimately flowing to the Inland Empire School of the Bible as resulting from a state action sponsoring or subsidizing religion.” <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487-488</citedDecision> (footnote, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).  6 Further, five Members of this Court, in separate opinions, emphasized both the importance of neutrality and of private choices, and the relationship between the two.  See <citedDecision>id., at *813490-491</citedDecision> (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring); <citedDecision>id., at 493</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also <citedDecision>id., at 490</citedDecision> (White, J., concurring).  The tax deduction for educational expenses that we upheld in Mueller was, in these respects, the same as the tuition grant in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> .  We upheld it chiefly because it “neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens,” 463 U. S., at 398-399 , and because “numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children,” id., at 399 , determined which schools would benefit from the deductions.  We explained that “[w]here, as here, aid to parochial schools is available only as a result of decisions of individual parents no ‘imprimatur of state approval’ can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally.” Ibid, (citation omitted); see id., at 397 (neutrality indicates lack of state imprimatur).  Agostini's second primary criterion for determining the effect of governmental aid is closely related to the first.  The second criterion requires a court to consider whether an aid program “define[s] its recipients by reference to religion.” 521 U. S., at 234 .  As we briefly explained in Agostini, id., at 230-231 , this second criterion looks to the same set of facts as does our focus, -under the first criterion, on neutrality, see id., at 225-226 , but the second criterion uses those facts to answer a somewhat different question — whether the criteria for allocating the aid “ereat[e] a financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination,” id., at 231 .  In Agos-tini we set out the following rule for answering this question: “This incentive is not present, however, where the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Under such circumstances, the aid is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion.” Ibid. *814 The cases on which Agostini relied for this rule, and Agos-tini itself, make clear the close relationship between this rule, incentives, and private choice.  For to say that a program does not create an incentive to choose religious schools is to say that the private choice is truly “independent,” Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487</citedDecision> .  See Agostini, supra, at 232 (holding that Title I did not create any impermissible incentive, because its services were “available to all children who meet the Act’s eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school”); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (discussing, in successive sentences, neutrality, private choice, and financial incentives, respectively); <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 488</citedDecision> (similar).  When such an incentive does exist, there is a greater risk that one could attribute to the government any indoctrination by the religious schools.  See Zobrest, supra, at 10 .  We hasten to add, what should be obvious from the rule itself, that simply because an aid program offers private schools, and thus religious schools, a benefit that they did not previously receive does not mean that the program, by reducing the cost of securing a religious education, creates, under Agostini’s second criterion, an “incentive” for parents to choose such an education for their children.  For any aid will have some such effect.  See Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 ; Everson, 330 U. S., at 17 ; see also Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 .  B Respondents inexplicably make no effort to address Chapter 2 under the Agostini test.

 They argue first, and chiefly, that “direct, nonineidental” aid to the primary educational mission of religious schools is always impermissible.  Second, they argue that provision to religious schools of aid that is divertible to religious use is similarly impermis *815 sible.  7 Respondents’ arguments are inconsistent with our more recent ease law, in particular Agostini and Zobrest , and we therefore reject them.  1 Although some of our earlier eases, particularly Ball, 473 U. S., at 393-394 , did emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect aid, the purpose of this distinction was *816 merely to prevent “subsidization” of religion, see id., at 394 .  As even the dissent all but admits, see post, at 889 (opinion of Souter, J.), our more recent cases address this purpose not through the direet/indireet distinction but rather through the principle of private choice, as incorporated in the first Agostini criterion (i.  e., whether any indoctrination could be attributed to the government).  If aid to schools, even “direct aid,” is neutrally available and, before reaching or benefiting any religious school, first passes through the hands (literally or figuratively) of numerous private citizens who are free to direct the aid elsewhere, the government has not provided any “support of religion,” <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 489</citedDecision> .  See supra, at 810.  Although the presence of private choice is easier to see when aid literally passes through the hands of individuals — which is why we have mentioned directness in the same breath with private choice, see, e. g., Agostini, 521 U. S., at 226 ; <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 487</citedDecision> ; Mueller, supra, at 399 — there is no reason why the Establishment Clause requires such a form.  Indeed, Agostini expressly rejected the absolute line that respondents would have us draw.  We there explained that “we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.” 521 U. S., at 225 .  Agostini relied primarily on <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> for this conclusion and made clear that private choice and neutrality would resolve the concerns formerly addressed by the rule in Ball .  It was undeniable in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> that the aid (tuition) would ultimately go to the Inland Empire School of the Bible and would support religious education.  We viewed this arrangement, however, as no different from a government issuing a paycheck to one of its employees knowing that the employee would direct the funds to a religious institution.  Both arrangements would be valid, for the same reason: “[A]ny money that ultimately went to religious institutions did so ‘only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of’ individuals.” *817 Agostini, supra, at 226 (quoting Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487</citedDecision> ).  In addition, the program in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> was neutral.  521 U. S., at 225 (quoting <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 487</citedDecision> ).  As Agostini explained, the same reasoning was at work in Zobrest , where we allowed the government-funded interpreter to provide assistance at a Catholic school, “even though she would he a mouthpiece for religious instruction,” because the interpreter was provided according to neutral eligibility criteria and private choice.  521 U. S., at 226 .  Therefore, the religious messages interpreted by the interpreter could not be attributed to the government, see ibid. (We saw no difference in Zobrest between the government hiring the interpreter direetly and the government providing funds to the parents who then would hire the interpreter.  509 U. S., at 13, n. 11 .) We rejected the dissent’s objection that we had never before allowed “a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination.” See id., at 18 (opinion of Blaekmun, J.).  Finally, in Agostini itself, we used the reasoning of <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest to conclude that remedial classes provided under Title I of the ESEA by public employees did not impermissibly finance religious indoctrination.  521 U. S., at 228 ; see id., at 230-232 .  We found it insignificant that students did not have to direetly apply for Title I services, that Title I instruction was provided to students in groups rather than individually, and that instruction was provided in the facilities of the private schools.  Id., at 226-229 .  To the extent that respondents intend their direct/indireet distinction to require that any aid be literally placed in the hands of schoolchildren rather than given directly to the school for teaching those same children, the very cases on which respondents most rely, Meek and Wolman , demonstrate the irrelevance of such formalism.  In Meek , we justified our rejection of a program that loaned instructional materials and equipment by, among other things, pointing out that the aid was loaned to the schools, and thus was “direct *818 aid.” 421 U. S., at 362-363 .  The materials-and-equipment program in Wolman was essentially identical, except that the State, in an effort to comply with Meek , see Wolman, 433 U. S., at 233, 250 , loaned the aid to the students.
**Lead Opinion**
 Compare Wolman, supra, at 250 (The “technical change in legal bailee” was irrelevant), with Meek, supra, at 391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (“Nor can the fact that the school is the bailee be regarded as constitutionally determinative”).  That Meek and Wolman reached the same result, on programs that were indistinguishable but for the direct/indirect distinction, shows that that distinction played no part in Meek .  Further, respondents’ formalistic line breaks down in the application to real-world programs.  In Allen, for example, although we did recognize that students themselves received and owned the textbooks, we also noted that the books provided were those that the private schools required for courses, that the schools eould collect students’ requests for books and submit them to the board of education, that the schools could store the textbooks, and that the textbooks were essential to the schools’ teaching of secular subjects.  See 392 U. S., at 243-245 .  Whether one chooses to label this program “direct” or “indirect” is a rather arbitrary choice, one that does not further the constitutional analysis.  Of course, we have seen “special Establishment Clause dangers,” Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842, when money is *819 given to religious schools or entities directly rather than, as in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Mueller , indirectly.  See 515 U. S., at 842 (collecting cases); id., at 846-847 (O’Connor, J., concurring); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608-609 (1988); compare Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), with Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472 (1973).  8 But *820 direct payments of money are not at issue in this case, and we refuse to allow a “special” case to create a rule for all cases. 2 Respondents also contend that the Establishment Clause requires that aid to religious schools not be impermissibly religious in nature or be divertible to religious use.  We agree with the first part of this argument but not the second.  Respondents’ “no divertibility” rule is inconsistent with our more recent case law and is unworkable.  So long as the governmental aid is not itself “unsuitable for use in the public schools because of religious content,” Allen, supra, at 245, and eligibility for aid is determined in a constitutionally permissible manner, any use of that aid to indoctrinate cannot be attributed to the government and is thus not of constitutional concern.  And, of course, the use to which the aid is put does not affect the criteria governing the aid’s allocation and thus does not create any impermissible incentive under Agostini’s second criterion.  Our recent precedents, particularly Zobrest , require us to reject respondents’ argument.  For Zobrest gave no consideration to divertibility or even to actual diversion.  Had such things mattered to the Court in Zobrest , we would have found the case to be quite easy — for striking down rather than, as we did, upholding the program — whieh is just how the dissent saw the case. See, e. g., 509 U. S., at 18 (Black-mun, J., dissenting) (“Until now, the Court never has authorized a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination”); id., at 22 (“[government crosses the boundary when it furnishes the medium for communication of a religious message.  ... [A] state-employed sign-language interpreter would serve as the conduit for James’ religious education, thereby assisting Salpointe [High School] in its mission of religious indoctrination”); id., at 23 (interpreter *821 “is likely to place the imprimatur of governmental approval upon the favored religion”); see generally id., at 18-23 .  Quite clearly, then, we did not, as respondents do, think that the use of governmental aid to further religious indoctrination was synonymous with religious indoctrination by the government or that such use of aid created any improper incentives.  Similarly, had we, in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , been concerned with diverti-bility or diversion, we would have unhesitatingly, perhaps summarily, struck down the tuition-reimbursement program, because it was certain that Witters sought to participate in it to acquire an education in a religious career from a sectarian institution.  Diversion was guaranteed.  Mueller took the same view as Zobrest and <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , for we did not in Mueller require the State to show that the tax deductions were only for the costs of education in secular subjects.  We declined to impose any such segregation requirement for either the tuition-expense deductions or the deductions for items strikingly similar to those at issue in Meek and Wolman , and here.  See Mueller, 463 U. S., at 391, n. 2 ; see also id., at 414 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (“The instructional materials which are subsidized by the Minnesota tax deduction plainly may be used to inculcate religious values and belief”).  Justice O’Connor acknowledges that the Court in Zo-brest and <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> approved programs that involved actual diversion.  See post, at 841 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The dissent likewise does not deny that <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> involved actual diversion.  See post, at 895-896, n. 16.  The dissent does claim that the aid in Zobrest “was not considered divertible,” post, at 895, n. 16, but the dissent in Zobrest , which the author of today’s dissent joined, understood the case otherwise.  See supra, at 820.  As that dissent made clear, diversion is the use of government aid to further a religious message.  See Zobrest, supra, at 21-22 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also post, at 842, 857 (O’Con-nor, J., concurring in judgment).  By that definition, the *822 government-provided interpreter in Zobrest was not only divertible, but actually diverted.

 But that period is one that the Court should regret, and it is thankfully long past.  There are numerous reasons to formally dispense with this factor.  First, its relevance in our precedents is in sharp decline.  Although our case law has consistently mentioned it even in recent years, we have not struck down an aid program in reliance on this factor since 1985, in Aguilar and Ball.  Agostini of course overruled Aguilar in Ml and Ball in part, and today Justice O’Connor distances herself from the part of Ball with which she previously agreed, by rejecting the distinction between public and private employees that was so prominent in Agostini .  Compare post, at 858-860, 863-864 (opinion concurring in judgment), with Agos-tini, supra, at 223-225, 234-235.  In <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , a year after Aguilar and Ball , we did not ask whether the Inland Empire School of the Bible was pervasively sectarian.  In Bowen , a 1988 decision, we refused to find facially invalid an aid program (although one not involving schools) whose recipients had, the District Court found, included pervasively sectarian institutions.  See 487 U. S., at 636, 647, 648 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Although we left it open on remand for the District Court to reaffirm its prior finding, we took pains to emphasize the narrowness of the “pervasively sectarian” category, see id., at 620-621 (opinion of the Court), and two *827 Members of the majority questioned whether this category was “well-founded,” id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring).  Then, in Zobrest and Agostini , we upheld aid programs to children who attended schools that were not only pervasively sectarian but also were primary and secondary.  Zobrest , in turning away a challenge based on the pervasively sectarian nature of Salpointe Catholic High School, emphasized the presence of private choice and the absence of government-provided sectarian content.  509 U. S., at 13 .

 But respondents have not contended, nor do we have any reason to think, that this deviation in the allocation to the LEA’s leads to deviation in the allocation among schools within each LEA, see §§ 7372(a)-(b), and, even if it did, we would not presume that such a deviation created any incentive one way or the other with regard to religion.  Chapter 2 also satisfies the first Agostini criterion.  The program makes a broad array of schools eligible for aid without regard to their religious affiliations or lack thereof.  § 7372; see § 7353(a)(3).  We therefore have no difficulty concluding that Ghapter 2 is neutral with regard to religion.  See Agostini, supra, at 225-226 .  Chapter 2 aid also, like the aid in Agostini, Zobrest, and <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , reaches participating schools only “as a consequence of private decisionmaking.” Agostini, supra, at 222 .  Private decisionmaking controls because of the per capita allocation scheme, and those decisions are independent because of the program’s neutrality.  See 521 U. S., at 226 .  It is the students and their parents— not the government — who, through their choice of school, determine who receives Chapter 2 funds.  The aid follows the child. *831 Because Chapter 2 aid is provided pursuant to private choices, it is not problematic that one could fairly describe Chapter 2 as providing “direct” aid.  The materials and equipment provided under Chapter 2 are presumably used from time to time by entire classes rather than by individual students (although individual students are likely the chief consumers of library books and, perhaps, of computers and computer software), and students themselves do not need to apply for Chapter 2 aid in order for their schools to receive it, but, as we explained in Agostini , these traits are not constitutionally significant or meaningful.  See id., at 228-229 .

 Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947) (upholding reimbursement to párente for costs of busing their children to public or private school).  Cases prior to Everson discussed the issue only indirectly, see, e. g., Vidal v. Philadelphia, 2 How. 127, 198-200 (1844); Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U. S. 50, 81 (1908), or evaluated aid to schools under other provisions of the Constitution, see Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370, 374-375 (1930).  Justice O’Connor acknowledges that “neutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs,” one that our recent eases have “emphasized .  .  .  repeatedly.” Post, at 838 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The majority opinion also noted that only a small portion of the overall aid under the State’s program would go to religious education, see Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> , but it appears that five Members of the Court thought this point irrelevant.  See <citedDecision>id., at 491, n. 8</citedDecision> (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring) (citing Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 401 (1983), to assert that validity of program “does not depend on the fact that petitioner appeal’s to be the only handicapped student who has sought to use his assistance to pursue religious training”); <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 490</citedDecision> (White, J., concurring) (agreeing with “most of Justice Powell’s concurring opinion with respect to the relevance of Mueller,” but not specifying further); <citedDecision>id., at 493</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (agreeing with Justice Powell’s reliance on Mueller and explaining that the program did not have an impermissible effect, because it was neutral and involved private choice, and thus “[n]o reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts before us an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief”).  More recently, in Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997), we held that the proportion of aid benefiting students at religious schools pursuant to a neutral program involving private choices was irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry.  Id., at 229 (refusing “to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid”); see also post, at 848 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting this passage).  Respondents also contend that Chapter 2 aid supplants, rather than supplements, the core educational function of parochial schools and therefore has the effect of furthering religion.  Our case law does provide some indication that this distinction may be relevant to determining whether aid results in governmental indoctrination, see Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228-229 ; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 12 (1993); but see School Dist. of G'rand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 396 (1985), but we have never delineated the distinction’s contours or held that it is constitutionally required.  Nor, to the extent that the supplement/supplant line is separable from respondents’ direct/indireet and “no divertibility” arguments, do we need to resolve the distinction’s constitutional status today, for, as we have already noted, Chapter 2 itself requires that aid may only be supplemental.  20 U. S. C. § 7371 (b).

 App. 112a.  More importantly, neither the District Court nor the Fifth Circuit even hinted that Jefferson Parish had violated § 7371(b), and respondents barely mention the statute in their brief to this Court, offering only the slimmest evidence of any possible violation, see id., at 63a.  Respondents argue that any Chapter 2 aid that a school uses to comply with state requirements (such as those relating to computers and libraries) necessarily violates whatever supplement/supplant line may exist in the Constitution, but our decision in Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), upholding reimbursement to parochial schools of costs relating to state-mandated testing, rejects any such blanket rule.  The reason for such concern is not that the form per se is bad, but that such a form creates special risks that governmental aid will have the effect of advancing religion (or, even more, a purpose of doing so).  An indirect form of payment reduces these risks.  See Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 (neutral tax deduction, because of its indirect form, allowed economic benefit to religious schools only as result of private choice and thus did not suggest state sanction of schools’ religious messages).  It is arguable, however, at least after Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, <citedDecision>474 U. S. 481</citedDecision> (1986), that the principles of neutrality and private choice would be adequate to address those special risks, for it is hard to see the basis for deciding <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> differently simply if the State had sent the tuition check directly to whichever school Witters chose to attend.  See Rosen-berger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 848 (1995) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (explaining <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> as reconciling principle of neutrality with principle against public funding of religious messages by relying on principle of private choice).  Similarly, we doubt it would be unconstitutional if, to modify Witters’ hypothetical, see <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 486-487</citedDecision> ; supra, at 816, a government employer directly sent a portion of an employee’s paycheck to a religious institution designated by that employee pursuant to a neutral charitable program.  We approved a similar arrangement in Quick Bear, 210 U. S., at 77-82 , and the Federal Government appears to have long had such a program, see 1999 Catalog of Caring: Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area 44, 45, 59, 74-75 (listing numerous religious organizations, many of which engage in religious education or in proselytizing, to which federal employees may contribute via payroll deductions); see generally Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788 (1985) (discussing Combined Federal Campaign).  Finally, at least some of our prior cases striking down direct payments involved serious concerns about whether the payments were truly neutral.  See, e. g., Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 762-764, 768, 774-780 (1973) (striking down, by 8-to-l vote, program providing direct grants for maintenance and repair of school facilities, where payments were allocated per-pupil but were only *820 available to private, nonprofit schools in low-income areas, “‘all or practically all’ ” of which were Catholic).  Id., at 768 .  The dissent would find an establishment of religion if a government-provided projector were used in a religious school to show a privately purchased religious film, even though a public school that possessed the same kind of projector would likely be constitutionally barred from refusing to allow a student bible club to use that projector in a classroom to show the very same film, where the classrooms and projectors were generally available to student groups.  See Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1998).
**Concurrence Opinion**
 For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question.  If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any particular indoctrination.  To put the point differently, if the government, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without regard to religion, to all who adequately further that purpose, then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose.” Ante, at 809-810 (citation omitted).  I agree with Justice Souter that the plurality, by taking such a stance, “appears to take evenhandedness neutrality and in practical terms promote it to a single and sufficient test for the establishment constitutionality of school aid.” Post, at 900 (dissenting opinion).  I do not quarrel with the plurality’s recognition that neutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs against Establishment Clause challenges.  Our cases have described neutrality in precisely this mannei’, and we have emphasized a program’s neutrality repeatedly in our decisions approving various forms of school aid.  See, e. g., Agostini, supra, at 228, 231-282 ; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 10 (1993); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, <citedDecision>474 U. S. 481, 487-488</citedDecision> (1986); <citedDecision>id., at 493</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring *839 in judgment); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397-399 (1983).  Nevertheless, we have never held that a government-aid program passes constitutional muster solely because of the neutral criteria it employs as a basis for distributing aid.  For example, in Agostini , neutrality was only one of several factors we considered in determining that New York City’s Title I program did not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  See 521 U. S., at 226-228 (noting lack of evidence of inculcation of religion by Title I instructors, legal requirement that Title I services be supplemental to regular curricula, and that no Title I funds reached religious schools’ coffers).  Indeed, given that the aid in Agostini had secular content and was distributed on the basis of wholly neutral criteria, our consideration of additional factors demonstrates that the plurality’s rule does not accurately describe our recent Establishment Clause jurisprudence.  See also Zobrest, swpra, at 10,12-13 (noting that no government funds reached religious school’s coffers, aid did not relieve school of expense it otherwise would have assumed, and aid was not distributed to school but to the child).  Justice Souter provides a comprehensive review of our Establishment Clause cases on government aid to religious institutions that is useful for its explanation of the various ways in which we have used the term “neutrality” in our decisions.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 See Agostini, supra, at 226-227 (“[N]o evidence has ever shown that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students”); Allen, supra, at 248 (“Nothing in this record supports the proposition that all textbooks, whether they deal with mathematics, physics, foreign languages, history, or literature, are used by the parochial schools to teach religion”).  Of course, our focus on the lack of such evidence would have been entirely unnecessary if we had believed that the Establishment Clause permits the actual diversion of secular government aid to religious indoctrination.  Our decision in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589 (1988), also demonstrates that actual diversion is constitutionally impermissible.  After eonclud- *841 ing that the government-aid program in question was constitutional on its face, we remanded the case so that the District Court could determine, after further factual development, whether aid recipients had used the government aid to support their religious objectives.  See id., at 621-622 ; id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“[T]he only purpose of further inquiring whether any particular grantee institution is pervasively sectarian is as a preliminary step to demonstrating that the funds are in fact being used to further religion”).  The remand would have been unnecessary if, as the plurality contends, actual diversion were irrelevant under the Establishment Clause.  The plurality bases its holding that actual diversion is permissible on <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest.  Ante, at 820-821.  Those decisions, however, rested on a significant factual premise missing from this ease, as well as from the majority of cases thus far considered by the Court involving Establishment Clause challenges to school aid programs.  Specifically, we decided <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest on the understanding that the aid was provided directly to the individual student who, in turn, made the choice of where to put that aid to use.  See Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> ; Zobrest, 609 U. S., at 10, 12.  Accordingly, our approval of the aid in both eases relied to a significant extent on the fact that “[a]ny aid .  .  .  that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.” <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 487</citedDecision> ; see Zobrest, supra, at 10 (“[A] government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents”).  This characteristic of both programs made them less like a direct subsidy, which would be impermissible under the Establishment Clause, and more akin to the government issuing a paycheck to an employee who, in turn, donates a portion of that cheek to a religious institution.  See, <citedDecision>e.  g., Witters, supra, at 486-487</citedDecision> ; see also Rosenberger, supra, at 848 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (discussing Witters).  *842 Recognizing this distinction, the plurality nevertheless finds <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest — to the extent those decisions might permit the use of government aid for religious purposes — relevant in any ease involving a neutral, per-capita-aid program.  See ante, at 880-831.  Like Justice Souter, I do not believe that we should treat a per-eapita-aid program the same as the true private-choice programs considered in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest .  See post, at 902.  First, when the government provides aid directly to the student beneficiary, that student can attend a religious school and yet retain control over whether the secular government aid will be applied toward the religious education.  The fact that aid flows to the religious school and is used for the advancement of religion is therefore wholly dependent on the student’s private decision.  See Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 848 (O’Con-nor, J., concurring) (discussing importance of private choice in Witters)', Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> (“[T]he fact that aid goes to individuals means that the decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not by the State”); <citedDecision>id., at 493</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“The aid to religion at issue here is the result of petitioner’s private choice”).  It is for this reason that in Agostini we relied on <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and.  Zobrest to reject the rule “that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid,” 521 U. S., at 225 , yet also rested our approval of New York City’s Title I program in part on the lack of evidence of actual diversion, id., at 226-227 .  Second, I believe the distinction between a per capita school aid program and a true private-choice program is significant for purposes of endorsement.  See, e. g., Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 692 (1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring).  In terms of public perception, a government program of direct aid to religious schools based on the number of students attending each school differs meaningfully from the government distributing aid directly to individual students *843 who, in turn, decide to use the aid at the same religious schools.  In the former example, if the religious school uses the aid to inculcate religion in its students, it is reasonable to say that the government has communicated a message of endorsement.  Because the religious indoctrination is supported by government assistance, the reasonable observer would naturally perceive the aid program as government support for the advancement of religion.  That the amount of aid received by the school is based on the school’s enrollment does not separate the government from the endorsement of the religious message.  The aid formula does not— and could not — indicate to a reasonable observer that the inculcation of religion is endorsed only by the individuals attending the religious school, who each affirmatively choose to direct the secular government aid to the school and its religious mission.  No such choices have been made.  In contrast, when government aid supports a school’s religious mission only because of independent decisions made by numerous individuals to guide their secular aid to that school, “[n]o reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts ... an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief.” <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 493</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Rather, endorsement of the religious message is reasonably attributed to the individuals who select the path of the aid.  Finally, the distinction between a per-capita-aid program and a true private-choice program is important when considering aid that consists of direct monetary subsidies.  This Court has “recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions.” Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 ; see also ibid, (collecting cases).  If, as the plurality contends, a per-capita-aid program is identical in relevant constitutional respects to a true private-choice program, then there is no reason that, under the plurality’s reasoning, the government should be precluded from providing direct money payments *844 to religious organizations (including churches) based on the number of persons belonging to each organization.  And, because actual diversion is permissible under the plurality’s holding, the participating religious organizations (including churches) could use that aid to support religious indoctrination.  To be sure, the plurality does not actually hold that its theory extends to direct money payments.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 First, we explained that the Court had since abandoned “the presumption erected in Meek and Ball that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion.” Id., at 223.  Rather, relying on Zobrest , we explained that in the absence of evidence showing that teachers were actually using the Title I aid to inculcate religion, we would presume that the instructors would comply with the program’s secular restrictions.  See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-227 .  The Title I services were required by statute to be “ 'secular, neutral, and nonideological.’ ” Id., at 210 (quoting 20U.S.C.  § 6321(a)(2)).  Second, we noted that the Court had “departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.” Agostini, supra, at 225 .  Relying on <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest , we noted that our cases had taken a more forgiving view of neutral government programs that make aid available generally without regard to the religious or nonreligious character of the recipient school.  See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 225-226 .  With respect to the specific Title I pro *848 gram at issue, we noted several factors that precluded us from finding an impermissible financing of religious indoctrination: the aid was “provided to students at whatever school they choose to attend,” the services were “by law supplemental to the regular curricula” of the benefited schools, “[n]o Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools,” and there was no evidence of Title I instructors having “attempted to inculcate religion in students.” Id., at 226-228 .  Relying on the same factors, we also concluded that the New York City program could not “reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.” Id., at 235 .  Although we found it relevant that Title I services could not be provided on a sehoolwide basis, we also explained that this fact was likely a sufficient rather than a necessary condition of the program’s constitutionality.  We were not “willing to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid.” Id., at 229 .  The Chapter 2 program at issue here bears the same hallmarks of the New York City Title I program that we found important in Agostini .

 Meek , for example, characterized Everson and Allen as approving “a general program” to pay bus fares and to lend school books, respectively, 421 U. S., at 360 ; id., at 360, n. 8 (approving two similar “general program[s]” in New York and Pennsylvania), and Wolman upheld diagnostic services described as “ ‘general welfare services for children,’” 433 U.S., at 243 (quoting Meek, supra, at 371, n. 21 ).  *882 Justice Blaekmun, writing in Roemer , first called such a “general” or evenhanded program “neutral,” in speaking of “facial neutrality’ as a relevant consideration in determining whether there was an Establishment Clause violation.  “[RJeligious institutions need not be quarantined from public benefits that are neutrally available to all.” 426 U. S., at 746-747 ; see also id., at 746 (discussing buses in Everson and school books in Allen as examples of “neutrally available” aid).  In Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983), the Court adopted the redefinition of neutrality as evenhandedness, citing Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38 , and alluding to our discussion of equal access in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981).  The Court upheld a system of tax deductions for sectarian educational expenses, in part because such a “facially neutral law,” 463 U. S., at 401 , made the deduction available for “all parents, including those whose children attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools,” id., at 397 .  Subsequent cases carried the point forward.  See, e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, <citedDecision>474 U. S. 481, 487</citedDecision> (1986) (quoting Nyquist and characterizing program as making aid “available generally”); Zobrest, swpra, at 8-9 (discussing “government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion” and citing Mueller and Witters); Agos-tini, supra, at 231 (discussing aid allocated on the basis of “neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, .  .  .  made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis”); see also Rosen-berger, 515 U. S., at 839 (“[T]he guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse”).  In sum, “neutrality” originally entered this field of jurisprudence as a eonelusory term, a label for the required rela *883 tionship between the government and religion as a state of equipoise between government as ally and government as adversary.  Reexamining Everson’s paradigm cases to derive a prescriptive guideline, we first determined that "neutral” aid was secular, nonideologieal, or unrelated to religious education.  Our subsequent reexamination of Everson and Allen, beginning in Nyquist and culminating in Mueller and most recently in Agostini , recast neutrality as a concept of "evenhandedness.” There is, of course, good reason for considering the generality of aid and the evenhandedness of its distribution in making close calls between benefits that in purpose or effect support a school’s religious mission and those that do not.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 677-678 (opinion of Burger, C. J.) (acknowledging “no single constitutional caliper”); Meek, 421 U. S., at 358-359 (noting considerations as guidelines only and discussing them as a matter of degree); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 383 (1985) (quoting Meek), overruled in part by Agostini, 521 U. S., at 203 ; Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 720 (1994) (opinion of O’Connor, J.) (“Experience proves that the Establishment Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single test”); Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 847-849 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (discussing need for line-drawing); id., at 852 (noting lack of a single “Grand Unified Theory” for Establishment Clause and citing Kiryas Joel)', ef.  Agostini, supra, at 232-233 (examining a variety of factors).  Thus, the basic principle of establishment scrutiny of aid remains the principle as stated in Everson , that there may be no public aid to religion or support for the religious mission of any institution.  B The insufficiency of evenhandedness neutrality as a standalone criterion of constitutional intent or effect has been clear from the beginning of our interpretative efforts, for an obvious reason.  Evenhandedness in distributing a benefit approaches the equivalence of constitutionality in this area only when the term refers to such universality of distribution that it makes no sense to think of the benefit as going to any discrete group.  Conversely, when evenhandedness refers to distribution to limited groups within society, like groups of schools or schoolchildren, it does make sense to regard the benefit as aid to the recipients.  See, e. g., Everson, 330 U. S., *885 at 16 (discussing aid that approaches the “verge” of forbidden territory); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 612 (“[W]e can only dimly perceive the lines of demarcation in this extraordinarily sensitive area of constitutional law”); Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 760-761 (noting the “most perplexing questions” presented in this area and acknowledging “‘entangling] precedents’”); Mueller, 463 U. S., at 393 (quoting Lemon); Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 485</citedDecision> (quoting Lemon).  Hence, if we looked no further than evenhandedness, and failed to ask what activities the aid might support, or in fact did support, religious schools could be blessed with government funding as massive as expenditures made for the benefit of their public school counterparts, and religious missions would thrive on public money.  This is why the consideration of less than universal neutrality has never been recognized as dispositive and has always been teamed with attention to other facts bearing on the substantive prohibition of support for a school’s religious objective.  At least three main lines of enquiry addressed particularly to school aid have emerged to complement evenhandedness neutrality.  First, we have noted that two types of aid recipients heighten Establishment Clause concern: pervasively religious schools and primary and secondary religious schools.  Second, we have identified two important characteristics of the method of distributing aid: directness or indirectness of distribution and distribution by genuinely independent choice.  Third, we have found relevance in at least five characteristics of the aid itself: its religious content; its cash form; its divertibility or actually diversion to religious support; its supplantation of traditional items of religious school expense; and its substantiality.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 On the one hand, we have understood how the youth of the students in such schools makes them highly susceptible to religious indoctrination.  Lemon, supra, at 616 (“This process of inculcating religious doctrine is, of course, enhanced by the impressionable age of the pupils, in primary schools particularly”).  On the other, we have recognized that the religious element in the education offered in most sectarian primary and secondary schools is far more intertwined with the secular than in university teaching, where the natural and academic skepticism of most older students may separate the two, see Tilton, supra, at 686-689 ; Roermer, 426 U. S., at 750 .  Thus, government benefits accruing to these pervasively religious primary and secondary schools raise special dangers of diversion into support for the religious indoctrination of children and the involvement of government in religious training and practice.  *888 2 We have also evaluated the portent of support to an organization’s religious mission that may be inherent in the method by which aid is granted, finding pertinence in at least two characteristics of distribution.  First, we have asked whether aid is direct or indirect, observing distinctions between government schemes with individual beneficiaries and those whose beneficiaries in the first instance might be religious schools.  Everson, supra, at 18 (bus fare supports parents and not schools); Allen, 392 U. S., 243 -244, and n. 6 (textbooks go to benefit children and parents, not schools); Lemon, supra, at 621 (invalidating direct aid to schools); Levitt, supra, at 480, 482 (invalidating direct testing aid to schools); Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487-488</citedDecision> (evaluating whether aid was a direct subsidy to schools).  Direct aid obviously raises greater risks, although recent eases have discounted this risk factor, looking to other features of the distribution mechanism.  Agostini, supra, at 225-226 .  8 *889 Second, we have distinguished between indirect aid that reaches religious schools only incidentally as a result of numerous individual choices and aid that is in reality directed to religious schools by the government or in practical terms selected by religious schools themselves.  Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 ; <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 488</citedDecision> ; Zobrest, supra, at 10 .  In these cases, we have declared the constitutionality of programs providing aid directly to parents or students as tax deductions or scholarship money, where such aid may pay for education at some sectarian institutions, Mueller, supra, at 399 ; Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> , but only as the result of “genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients,” <citedDecision>id., at 487</citedDecision> .  We distinguished this path of aid from the route in Ball and Wolman , where the opinions indicated that “[wjhere ... no meaningful distinction can be made between aid to the student and aid to the school, the concept of a loan to individuals is a transparent fiction.” <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487, n. 4</citedDecision> (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  9 3 In addition to the character of the school to which the benefit accrues, and its path from government to school, a number of features of the aid itself have figured in the elassifica- *890 tions we have made.  First, we have barred aid with actual religious content, which would obviously run afoul of the ban on the government’s participation in religion, Everson, 330 U. S., at 16 ; Walz, 397 U. S., at 668 ; cf. Lemon, 403 U. S., at 617 (discussing variable ideological and religious character of religious teachers compared to fixed content of books).  In eases where we have permitted aid, we have regularly characterized it as “neutral” in the sense (noted supra, at 879-881) of being without religious content.  See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 688 (characterizing buildings as “religiously neutral”); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (describing translator as “neutral service”); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 232 (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was “neutral and nonideological”).  See also ante, at 820 (plurality opinion) (barring aid with religious content).  10 Second, we have long held government aid invalid when circumstances would allow its diversion to religious education.  The risk of diversion is obviously high when aid in the form of government funds makes its way into the coffers of religious organizations, and so from the start we have understood the Constitution to bar outright money grants of aid to religion.  11 See Everson, 830 U. S., at 16 (“[The State] *891 cannot consistently with the ‘establishment of religion’ clause of the First Amendment contribute tax-raised funds to the support of an institution which teaches the tenets and faith of any church”); id., at 18 (“The State contributes no money to the schools.  It does not support them”); Allen, 892 U. S., at 243-244 (“[N]o funds or books are furnished to parochial schools, and the financial benefit is to parents and children, not schools”); Walz, supra, at 675 (“Obviously a direct money subsidy would be a relationship pregnant with involvement and, as with most governmental grant programs, could encompass sustained and detailed administrative relationships for enforcement of statutory or administrative standards”); Lemon, supra, at 612 (identifying “three main evils” against which Establishment Clause was to protect as “sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity,” citing Walz); 403 U. S., at 621 (distinguishing direct financial aid program from Everson and Allen and noting problems with required future surveillance); Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 762, 774 (striking down “direct money grants” for maintaining buildings because there was no attempt to restrict payments to those expenditures related exclusively to secular purposes); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480, 482 (striking down “direct money grant” for testing expenses); 12 Hunt v. *892 McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 745, n. 7 (1973) (noting approved aid is “no expenditure of public funds, either by grant or loan”); Wolman, 433 U. S., at 239 , and n. 7 (noting that “statute does not authorize any payment to nonpublic school personnel for the costs of administering the tests”); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228-229 (emphasizing that approved services are not “distributed ‘directly to the religious schools.’ ... No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a school-wide basis” (citations omitted)); Bowen, 487 U. S., at 614-615 ; Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 (noting that “we have recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions”); ef.  Lemon, 403 U. S., at 619-620 (noting that safeguards and accounting inspections required to prevent government funds from supporting religious education will cause impermissible entanglement); Roemer, 426 U. S., at 753-757 (approving segregated funds after finding recipients not pervasively religious); Ball, 473 U. S., at 392-393 (noting that “[w]ith but one exception, our subsequent eases have struck down attempts by States to make payments out of *893 public tax dollars directly to primary or secondary religious educational institutions”)?  overruled in part by Agostini, supra, at 236 ; Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487</citedDecision> (“It is equally well-settled .  .. that the State may not grant aid to a religious school, whether cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct subsidy to the religious school” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); Rosenberger, supra, at 851-852 (O’CONNOR, J., concurring) (noting that student fee was not a tax).  Divertibility is not, of course, a characteristic of cash alone, and when examining provisions for ostensibly secular supplies we have considered their susceptibility to the service of religious ends.  13 In upholding a scheme to provide students with secular textbooks, we emphasized that “each book loaned must be approved by the public school authorities; only secular books may receive approval.” Allen, 392 U. S., at 244-245 ; see also Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362 (opinion of Stewart, J.); Wolman, supra, at 237-238 .  By the same token, we could not sustain provisions for instructional materials adaptable to teaching a variety of subjects.  14 Meek, supra, at 363 ; Wolman, supra, at 249-250 .  While the textbooks had a known and fixed secular content not readily di~ *894 vertible to religious teaching purposes, the adaptable materials did not.

 17 In Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12 , the Court specifically distinguished Meek and Ball by explaining that the invalid programs in those eases “relieved sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students.” In Agostini , the Court made a point of noting that the objects of the aid were “by law supplemental to the regular curricula” and, citing Zobrest , explained that the remedial education services did not relieve the religious schools of costs they would otherwise have borne.  521 U. S., at 228 (citing Zobrest, supra, at 12 ).  The Court explicitly stated that the *898 services in question did not “supplant the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already provided in New York City’s sectarian schools.” 521 U. S., at 229 .  Finally, we have recognized what is obvious (however imprecise), in holding “substantial” amounts of aid to be unconstitutional whether or not a plaintiff can show that it supplants a specific item of expense a religious school would have borne.  18 In Meek, 421 U. S., at 366 , we invalidated the loan of instructional materials to religious schools because “faced with the substantial amounts of direct support authorized by [the program], it would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania’s church-related elementary and secondary schools and then characterize [the program] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.” Id., at 365 .  See id., at 366 (“Substantial aid to the educational function of such schools ... necessarily results in aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole”); see also Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 783 ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 250-251 .  In Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> , the Court asked whether the aid in question was a direct subsidy to religious schools and addressed the substantiality of the aid obliquely in noting that “nothing in the record indicates that.  .  .  any significant portion of the *899 aid expended under the Washington program as a whole will end up flowing to religious education.” In Zobrest, supra, at 12 , the Court spoke of the substantiality test in Meek , noting that “[disabled children, not sectarian schools, are the primary beneficiaries of the [Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA)]; to the extent sectarian schools benefit at all from the IDEA, they are only incidental beneficiaries.” C This stretch of doctrinal history leaves one point clear beyond peradventure: together with James Madison we have consistently understood the Establishment Clause to impose a substantive prohibition against public aid to religion and, hence, to the religious mission of sectarian schools.  Even-handedness neutrality is one, nondispositive pointer toward an intent and (to a lesser degree) probable effect on the permissible side of the line between forbidden aid and general public welfare benefit.  Other pointers are facts about the religious mission and education level of benefited schools and their pupils, the pathway by which a benefit travels from public treasury to educational effect, the form and content of the aid, its adaptability to religious ends, and its effects on school budgets.  The object of all enquiries into such matters is the same whatever the particular circumstances: is the benefit intended to aid in providing the religious element of the education and is it likely to do so?

 330 U. S., at 15-16 ; id., at 25-26 (Jackson, J., dissenting); id., at 28-29, 31-32 (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  In fact, religious education in Roman Catholic schools is defined as part of required religious practice; aiding it is thus akin to aiding a church service.  See 1988 Code of Canon Law, Canon 798, reprinted in The Code of Canon Law: A Text and Commentary 566 (1985) (hereinafter Text & Commentary) (directing parents to entrust children to Roman Catholic schools or otherwise provide for Roman Catholic education); Canon 800, §2, Text & Commentary 567 (requiring the faithful to support establishment and maintenance of Roman Catholic schools); Canons 802, 804, Text & Commentary 567, 568 (requiring diocesan bishop to establish and regulate schools “imparting an education imbued with the Christian spirit”).  Although the Court no longer assumes that public school teachers assigned to religious schools for limited purposes will teach religiously, see Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 228-228 (1997), we have never abandoned the presumption that religious teachers will teach just that way.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 615-620 (1971); id., at 635-641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 480 (1973); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 369-371 (1975); Wol- *887 man v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 249-250 (1977); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 399-400 (1985) (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by Agostini, supra, at 236 .  Cf. NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 504 (1979) (“The church-teacher relationship in a church-operated school differs from the employment relationship in a public or other nonreligious school”).  In Agostini , the Court indicated that “we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid,” 521 U. S., at 225 , and cited Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, <citedDecision>474 U. S. 481</citedDecision> (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1998).  However, Agostini did not rely on this dictum, instead clearly stating that “[w]hile it is true that individual students may not directly apply for Title I services, it does not follow from this premise that those services are distributed ‘directly to the religious schools.’ In fact, they are not.  No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a sehoolwide basis.” 521 U. S., at 228-229 (citations omitted).  Until today, this Court has never permitted aid to go directly to schools on a schoolwide basis.  The plurality misreads our precedent in suggesting that we have abandoned directness of distribution as a relevant consideration.  See ante, at 815-818.  In Wolman, we stated that nominally describing aid as to students would not bar a court from finding that it actually provided a subsidy to a school, 433 U. S., at 250 , but we did not establish that a program giving “direct” aid to schools was therefore permissible.  In <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , we made the focus of Wolman dear, continuing to examine aid to determine *889 if it was a “direct subsidy” to a school, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487</citedDecision> , and distinguishing the aid at issue from impermissible aid in Ball and Wolman precisely because the designation of the student as recipient in those eases was only nominal.  <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487, n. 4</citedDecision> .  Our subsequent cases have continued to ask whether government aid programs constituted impermissible “direct subsidies” to religious schools even where they are directed by individual choice.  Zobrest, supra, at 11-13; Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 399 (1983); Agostini, supra, at 226 .  We have also permitted the government to supply students with public-employee translators, Zobrest, supra, at 10, and public-employee special education teachers, Agostini, supra, at 226,228 , who directly provided .them with government services in whatever schools those specific students attended, public or nonpublic.  I have already noted Agostini’s limitations.  See n. 8, supra. 1 agree with the plurality that the Establishment Clause absolutely prohibits the government from providing aid with dear religious content to religious, or for that matter nonreligious, schools.  Ante, at 822-825.

 In that case, we found the other safeguards against the diversion of such funds to religious uses sufficient to allow such aid: “A *892 contrary view would insist on drawing a constitutional distinction between paying the nonpublic school to do the grading and paying state employees or some independent service to perform that task, even though the grading function is the same regardless of who performs it and would not have the primary effect of aiding religion whether or not performed by nonpublic school personnel.” Id., at 658 .  Aside from this isolated circumstance, where we found ironclad guarantees of nondiversion, we have never relaxed our prohibition on direct cash aid to pervasively religious schools, and have in fact continued to acknowledge the concern.  See Agostini , 521U.  S., at 228-229; cf. Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 .  The plurality concedes this basic point.  See ante, at 818-819.  Given this, I find any suggestion that this prohibition has been undermined by Mueller or <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> without foundation.  See ante, at 819-820, n. 8.  Those cases involved entirely different types of aid, namely, tax deductions and individual scholarship aid for university education, see also n. 16, infra, and were followed by Rosenberger and Agostini , which continued to support this absolute restriction.  I reject the plurality’s argument that divertibility is a boundless principle.  Ante, at 824-825.  Our long experience of evaluating this consideration demonstrates its practical limits.  See infra this page and 894-895.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Zobrest does not reject the principle of divertibility.  There the government provided only a translator who was not considered divertible because he did not add to or subtract from the religious message.  The Court approved the translator as it would approve a hearing aid, health services, diagnostics, and tests.  See Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 13, and n. 10.  Cf Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U. S. 291, 299-300 (1899); Wolman, 433 U. S., at 244 .  Zobrest thus can be thought of as akin to our approval of diagnostic services in Wolman, supra, at 244 , which we considered to have “little or no educational content[,] not [to be] closely associated with the educational mission of the nonpublie school,” and not to pose “an impermissible *896 risk of the fostering of ideological views.” The fact that the dissent saw things otherwise (as the plurality points out, ante, at 821) is beside the point here.  Similarly, the plurality is mistaken in reading our holdings in Mueller and <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , see ante, at 821, to undermine divertibility as a relevant principle.  First, these cases approved quite factually distinct types of aid; Mueller involving tax deductions, which have a quite separate history of approval, see 468 U. S., at 396, and nn. 5, 6 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970», and <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> involving scholarship money distributed to a university, not a primary or secondary school, see Tilton, 403 U. S., at 685-686 , that was not significant enough as a whole to support that institution, Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> .  Second, in neither case did the program at issue provide direct aid on a schoolwide basis (as Chapter 2 does here); in both we found a distinction based on the genuinely independent, private choices which allocated such very different types of aid (tax deductions and university scholarship money that did not amount to substantial support of the university).  See Mueller, supra, at 399 ; <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 488</citedDecision> .  Our departure from this principle in Regan is not easily explained, but it is an isolated holding surrounded by otherwise unbroken adherence to the no-supplanting principle.  Long after Regan we have continued to find the supplement/supplant distinction, like the bar to substantial aid, to be an important consideration.  See Zobrest, supra, at 12; Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228 ; c£ <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 487-488</citedDecision> (discussing rule against "direct subsidy”).  The weight that the plurality places on Regan is thus too much for it to bear.  See ante, at 815, n. 7.  Moreover, the apparent object of the Regan Court's concern was vindicating the principle that aid with fixed secular content was permissible, distinguishing it from the divertible testing aid in Levitt.  Regan, 444 U. S., at 661 -662 (citing Wolman, supra, at 263 ); c£ Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 .  The plurality provides no explanation for our continued reference to the principle of no-supplanting aid in subsequent cases, such as Zobrest and Agostini , which it finds trustworthy guides elsewhere in its discussion of the First Amendment.  See ante, at 822-823, 825, 827, 829-832.  Nor does the plurality explain why it places so much weight on Regan’s apparent departure from the no-supplanting rule while it ignores Regan’s core reasoning that the testing aid there was permissible because, in direct contrast to Levitt , the aid was not divertible.  1 do not read the plurality to question the prohibition on substantial aid.  The plurality challenges any rule based on the proportion of aid that a program provides to religious recipients, citing <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Agostini .  See ante, at 812, n. 6.  I reject the plurality’s reasoning.  The plurality misreads <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> ; Justice Marshall, writing for the Court in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , emphasized that only a small amount of aid was provided to religious institutions, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> , and no controlling majority rejected the importance of this fact.  The plurality also overreads Agostini, supra, at 229 , which simply declined to adopt a rule based on proportionality.  Moreover, regardless of whether the proportion of aid actually provided to religious schools is relevant, we have never questioned our holding in Meek that substantial aid to religious schools is prohibited.  Adopting the plurality’s rule would permit practically any government aid to religion so long as it could be supplied on terms ostensibly comparable to the terms under which aid was provided to nonreligious recipients.  As a principle of constitutional sufficiency, the manipulability of this rule is breathtaking.  A legislature would merely need to state a secular objective in order to legalize massive aid to all religions, one religion, or even one sect, to which its largess could be directed through the easy exercise of crafting facially neutral terms under which to offer aid favoring that religious group.  Short of formally replacing the Establishment Clause, a more dependable key to the public fisc or a cleaner break with prior law would be difficult to imagine.
