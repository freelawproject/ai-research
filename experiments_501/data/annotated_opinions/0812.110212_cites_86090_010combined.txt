1 E. Coke, A Commentarie upon Littleton 6b (1628).  See, generally, 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2227 (McNaughton rev. 1961).  This spousal disqualification sprang from two canons of medieval jurisprudence: first, the rule that an accused was not permitted to testify in his own behalf because of his interest in the proceeding; second, the concept that husband and wife were one, and that since the woman had no recognized separate legal existence, the husband was that one.  From those two now long-abandoned doctrines, it followed that what was inadmissible from the lips of the defendant-husband was also inadmissible from his wife.  Despite its medieval origins, this rule of spousal disqualification remained intact in most common-law jurisdictions well into the 19th century.  See id., § 2333.  It was applied by this Court in Stein v. Bowman, <citedDecision>13 Pet. 209, 220-223</citedDecision> (1839), in Graves v. United States, 150 U. S. 118 (1893), and again in Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, 254 U. S. 189, 195 (1920), where it was deemed so well established a proposition as to "hardly require[e] mention." Indeed, it was not until 1933, in Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371 , that this Court abolished the testimonial disqualification in the federal courts, so as to permit the spouse of a defendant to testify in the defendant's behalf.  Funk , however, left undisturbed the rule that either spouse could prevent the other from giving adverse testimony.  Id., at 373 .  The rule thus evolved into one of privilege rather than one of absolute disqualification.  See J. Maguire, Evidence, Common Sense and Common Law 78-92 (1947).  The modern justification for this privilege against adverse spousal testimony is its perceived role in fostering the harmony and sanctity of the marriage relationship.

United States v. Bryan, 339 U. S. 323, 331 (1950).  As such, they must be strictly construed and accepted "only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth." Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 234 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  Accord, United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 , *51 709-710 (1974).  Here we must decide whether the privilege against adverse spousal testimony promotes sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for probative evidence in the administration of criminal justice.  It is essential to remember that the Hawkins privilege is not needed to protect information privately disclosed between husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship once described by this Court as "the best solace of human existence." <citedDecision>Stein</citedDecision> v. Bowman, <citedDecision>13 Pet., at 223</citedDecision> .  Those confidences are privileged under the independent rule protecting confidential marital communications.  Blau v. United States, 340 U. S. 332 (1951); see n. 5, supra. The Hawkins privilege is invoked, not to exclude private marital communications, but rather to exclude evidence of criminal acts and of communications made in the presence of third persons.  No other testimonial privilege sweeps so broadly.  The privileges between priest and penitent, attorney and client, and physician and patient limit protection to private communications.  These privileges are rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust.  The priest-penitent privilege recognizes the human need to disclose to a spiritual counselor, in total and absolute confidence, what are believed to be flawed acts or thoughts and to receive priestly consolation and guidance in return.
