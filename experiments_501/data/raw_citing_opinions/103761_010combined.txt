  The deceased was a United States customs inspector. While boarding the vessel on his official duties in July 1938, a rung of the ladder which he was climbing broke. The injuries which resulted caused his death. At the time of the injury the vessel was docked at a pier in New York City.

It is the real party affected in all of these actions.” 280 U. S. pp. 326-327.

  case that § 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act was intended to provide the only available remedy against the United States or its wholly owned corporations for enforcement of maritime causes of action covered by the Act. But there is not the slightest intimation or suggestion in the history of that Act that it was designed to abolish all remedies which might exist against a private company for torts committed during its operation of government vessels under agency agreements.
 </p>
<p id="b691-4">
  Sec. 1 of the Suits in Admiralty Act provides that no vessel owned by the United States or a governmental corporation or “operated by or for the United States, or such corporation” shall be “subject to arrest or seizure by judicial process in the United States or its possessions.” That section was designed to avoid the inconvenience, expense and delay resulting from the holdings in

  would lie against vessels owned by the United States. See S. Rep. No. 223, 66th Cong., 1st Sess. ; H. Rep. No. 497, 66th Cong., 2d Sess. The wording of that section malees clear that the right to arrest or seize the vessel was taken away whether the vessel was operated by the United States or its wholly owned corporation or for either of them by a private company. To that extent the Act affects remedies which would otherwise exist on maritime causes of action arising out of operation of government vessels by private companies for the United States or its wholly owned corporations. Yet there is no indication whatsoever that it went further and took away any personal remedy which a tort claimant might have against such a private operator. While § 1 abolishes the right to arrest or seize the vessel, § 2 provides that “a libel in personam may be brought against the United States or against such corporations” in cases where “if such vessel were privately owned or operated ... a proceeding in
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="580">

  admiralty could be maintained.” Sec. 2, however, does not mention private operators. Nor do the Committee Reports advert to private operators, except as they may be affected by § 1. The liability of an agent for his own negligence has long been embedded in the law.

  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="581">

  mentals of the law of agency should hardly be left to conjecture. The withdrawal of the right to sue the agent for his torts would result at times in a substantial dilution of the rights of claimants. Assuming that the ordinary rules of agency apply in determining whether the United States or the Maritime Commission is responsible under § 2 of the Act for torts of private operators such as respondent, there would be instances where unless the private operator was liable no one would be. The principal is not liable for every negligent act of his agent. Furthermore, if all suits to enforce maritime causes of action must be brought in such cases under § 2 of the Act the short statute of limitations of two years contained in § 5 is applicable.

  Moreover, if, as apparently was the case here, the claimant was eligible to receive and did receive compensation under the United States Employees Compensation Act (<span class="citation no-link">39 Stat. 742</span>, <span class="citation no-link">5 U.

He may however sue “some person other than the United States”; and in case of recovery the amount is credited on the compensation payable to him. § 777. We mention these matters as illustrations of the practical impact on claimants if it were held that the Suits in Admiralty Act restricted all suits in cases like the present to libels
  <em>
   in personam
  </em>
  against the United States or its wholly owned corporations. We can only conclude that if Congress had intended to make such an inroad on the rights of claimants it would have said so in unambiguous terms. There is one bit of legislative history which it is claimed reveals such a purpose. It is a single statement made by Representative Volstead, sponsor of the bill in the House (59 Cong. Rec. 1680): “Mr. White of Maine. Would this bill apply to Shipping Board vessels that are allocated to private concerns and are being operated by private concerns? Mr. Volstead: Yes; it covers all ships owned by
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="582"> 
   *582
   </span>
  the Government.” The reply was accurate. The Act does cover government ships operated by private concerns. For as we have seen § 1 is applicable to that situation as well as to others and takes away the remedy of a libel
  <em>
   in rem.
  </em>
  But it is a
  <em>
   non sequitur
  </em>
  to say that because the Act takes away the remedy of libel
  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  in all cases involving government vessels and restricts the remedies against the United States and its wholly owned corporations, it must be presumed to have abolished all right to proceed against all other parties. Congress in fashioning § 2 of the Act, like this Court in interpreting it in the

  </em>
  case, was preoccupied with suits against the United States and its wholly owned corporations. Since it dealt under § 2 only with libels
  <em>
   in personam
  </em>
  against them, the only fair assumption is that it left all personal actions against others wholly unaffected.
 </p>
<p id="b694-5">
  It is contended, however, that if the judgment against respondent stands, the United States ultimately will have to pay it by reason of provisions of the contract between respondent and the Commission. It is therefore urged that the United States is the real party in interest. We do not stop to interpret the contract. Even if we assume, without deciding, that the Commission has contracted to reimburse the respondent for such expenditures, it does not affect the result in this case. The right of the private operator to recover over from the United States would be a matter of favor, not of right, in many cases. For apart from any express contract the agent’s right of exoneration or indemnity has not been thought to extend to situations where his liability was based on his own fault. 4 Williston, Contracts (1936 ed.), § 1026. Hence we cannot conclude that, in all cases where a private operator of a government vessel under an agency agreement is sued, the United States would as a matter of law ultimately be liable to pay in absence of an express provision for exoneration. It is hard to believe that Congress had any such notion when
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="583"> 
   *583
   </span>
  it passed the Suits in Admiralty Act. To attribute that idea to it would be to give the Act a construction which would in practical effect encourage the assumption by the United States of the obligations of private persons.

  Moreover, if petitioner had a cause of action against respondent, it is difficult to see how she could be deprived of it by reason of a contract between respondent and the Commission. Immunity from suit on a cause of action which the law creates cannot be so readily obtained. Cf.

S. 18</a></span>, was a recent example. In that case the contractor in building dikes in the Missouri River for the United States had washed away a part of the plaintiff’s land. We held that the contractor was not liable, saying (pp. 20-21) “that if this authority to carry out the project was validly conferred, that is, if what was done was within the constitutional power of Congress, there is no liability on the part of the contractor for executing its will.” But here the situation is quite different. The question is not whether the Commission had authority to delegate to respondent responsibilities for managing and operating the vessel as its agent. It is whether respondent can escape liability for a negligent exercise of that delegated power if we assume
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="584">

  that by contract it will be exonerated or indemnified for any damages it must pay. As stated in

  </em>
  pp. 566-567, “the general rule is that any person within the jurisdiction always is amenable to the law.

  but by reason of concessions made by contracting officers of the government. Such a change would be detrimental to the interests of private claimants, as we have said, since it would subtract from the legal remedies which the law has afforded them. Beyond that it would make the existence of a right to exoneration or indemnity a jurisdictional fact. That could hardly help but complicate and delay the enforcement of rights based on these maritime torts. At least in the absence of a clear Congressional policy to that end, we cannot go so far.

   The provision in § 8 of the Suits in Admiralty Act that any final judgment “rendered in any suit herein authorized” shall be paid “by the proper accounting officers of the United States” must be taken to refer only to judgments against the United States or its wholly owned corporations since under our construction the Act does not control or affect actions

   against private operators.

   v.
   <em>
    The Eglantine, ante,
   </em>
   p. 395, in which we held that the United States by appearing in an action for libel
   <em>
    in rem
   </em>
   against a government vessel for damages suffered during its operation by the United States could invoke the two-year statute of limitations contained in § 5 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, even though the United States had sold the vessel to a private operator. In that case we were dealing with § 4 of the Act which expressly provides for such an appearance in that type of case and which states that “thereafter such cause shall proceed against the United States in accordance with the provisions of this Act.” Accordingly we stated, “The conclusion is inescapable that there is no practical difference between suits against the government as owner of the vessel and against the government as the party in interest when it voluntarily appears to defend its lately sold property against tort liability.”
