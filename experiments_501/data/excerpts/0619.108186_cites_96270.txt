 There the defendant had been tried and convicted by a 12-man jury for a crime committed in the Territory of Utah. A new trial was granted, but by that time Utah had been admitted as a State.  The defendant’s new trial proceeded under Utah’s Constitution, providing for a jury of only eight members.  This Court reversed the resulting conviction, holding that Utah’s constitutional provision was an ex post facto law as applied to the defendant.  In reaching its conclusion, the Court announced that the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the defendant’s trial when Utah was a Territory, and that the jury referred to in the Amendment was a jury “constituted, as it was at common law, of twelve persons, neither more nor less.” 170 U. S., at 349 .  Arguably unnecessary for the result, 26 *91 this announcement was supported simply by referring to the Magna Carta, 27 and by quoting passages from treatises which noted — what has already been seen— that at common law the jury did indeed consist of 12.  Noticeably absent was any discussion of the essential step in the argument: namely, that every feature of the jury as it existed at common law — whether incidental or essential to that institution — was necessarily included in the Constitution wherever that document referred to a “jury.” 28 Subsequent decisions have reaffirmed the *92 announcement in Thompson , often in dictum 29 and usually by relying — where there was any discussion of the issue at all — solely on the fact that the common-law jury consisted of 12.  30 See Patton v. United States, 281 U. S. 276, 288 (1930); 31 Rassmussen v. United States, <citedDecision>197 U. S. 516, 519</citedDecision> (1905); Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S. 581, 586 (1900).  While “the intent of the Framers” is often an elusive quarry, the relevant constitutional history casts considerable doubt on the easy assumption in our past decisions that if a given feature existed in a jury at common law in 1789, then it was necessarily preserved in the Con *93 stitution.  Provisions for jury trial were first placed in the Constitution in Article Ill’s provision that “[t]he Trial of all Crimes .  .  .  shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed.” 32 The “very scanty history [of this provision] in the records of the Constitutional Convention” 33 sheds little light either way on the intended correlation between Article Ill’s “jury” and the features of the jury at common law. 34 Indeed, pending and after the adoption of the Constitution, fears were expressed that Article Ill’s provision failed to preserve the common-law right to be tried by a “jury of the vicinage.” 35 That concern, as well as the concern *94 to preserve the right to jury in civil as well as criminal cases, furnished part of the impetus for introducing amendments to the Constitution that ultimately resulted in the jury trial provisions of the Sixth and Seventh Amendments.  As introduced by James Madison in the House, the Amendment relating to jury trial in criminal cases would have provided that: “The trial of all crimes .

 As the text indicates, the question is not whether the 12-man jury is traced to 1215 or to 1789, but whether that particular feature must be accepted as a sine qua non of the jury trial guaranteed by the Constitution.  See Heller, supra, n. 25, at 64.  The Thompson opinion also reasoned that if a jury can be reduced from 12 to eight, then there was nothing to prevent its similarly being reduced to four or two or even zero, thus dispensing with the jury altogether.  See 170 U. S., at 353 .  That bit of “logic,” resurrected today in Mr. Justice Harlan’s concurring opinion, post, at 126, suffers somewhat as soon as one recognizes that he can get off the “slippery slope” before he reaches the bottom.  We have no occasion in this case to determine what minimum number can still constitute a “jury,” but we do not doubt that six is above that minimum.  A ruling that the Sixth Amendment refers to a common-law jury was essential to the holding in Rassmussen v. United States, <citedDecision>197 U. S. 516</citedDecision> (1905), where the Court held invalid a conviction by a six-man jury in Alaska.  The ruling was accepted at the Government’s concession without discussion or citation; the major focus of the case was on the question whether the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the territory in question at all. See <citedDecision>197 U. S., at 519</citedDecision> .  Similarly, cases interpreting the jury trial provisions of the Seventh Amendment generally leap from the fact that the jury possessed a certain feature at common law to the conclusion that that feature must have been preserved by the Amendment’s simple reference to trial by “jury.” E. g., Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 13-14 (1899); American Publishing Co. v. Fisher, 166 U. S. 464, 468 (1897).  While much of our discussion in this case may be thought to bear equally on the interpretation of the Seventh Amendment’s jury trial provisions, we emphasize that the question is not before us; we do not decide whether, for example, additional references to the “common law" that occur in the Seventh Amendment might support a different interpretation.  See infra, at 97 and n. 44.  The Patton opinion furnishes an interesting illustration of the Court’s willingness to re-examine earlier assertions about the nature of “jury trial” in almost every respect except the 12-man-jury requirement.  Patton reaffirmed the 12-man requirement with a simple citation to Thompson v. Utah , while at the same time discarding as “dictum” the equally dogmatic assertion in Thompson that the requirement could not be waived.  See 281 U. S., at 293 .

**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 The Court’s elaboration of what is required provides no standard and vexes the meaning of the right to a jury trial in federal courts, as well as state courts, by uncertainty.  Can it be doubted that a unanimous jury of 12 provides a greater safeguard than a majority vote of six?  The uncertainty that will henceforth plague the meaning of trial by jury is itself a further sufficient reason for not hoisting the anchor to history.  2.  The circumvention of history is compounded by the cavalier disregard of numerous pronouncements of this Court that reflect the understanding of the jury as one of 12 members and have fixed expectations accordingly.  Thus in Thompson v. Utah a unanimous Court answered in the affirmative the question whether the Sixth Amendment jury “is a jury constituted, as it was at common law, of twelve persons, neither more nor less.” 170 U. S. 343, 349 (1898), 12 and it appears that before Duncan no Justice of this Court has seen fit to question this holding, one that has often been reiterated.  See Patton v. United States, 281 U. S. 276, 288 (1930), where *127 the Court reaffirmed earlier pronouncements and stated that the Sixth Amendment jury is characterized by three essential features: “(1) that the jury should consist of twelve men, neither more nor less; (2) that the trial should be in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge having power to instruct them as to the law and advise them in respect of the facts; and (3) that the verdict should be unanimous.” See also Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S. 581, 586 (1900); Rassmussen v. United States, <citedDecision>197 U. S. 516, 527</citedDecision> (1905); Andres v. United States, 333 U. S. 740, 748 (1948) (unanimity).  13 As Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated in Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 392 (1958), in applying a constitutional provision “rooted in history ... a long course of adjudication in this Court carries impressive authority.” The principle of stare decisis is multifaceted.  It is a solid foundation for our legal system; yet care must be taken not to use it to create an unmovable structure.  It provides the stability and predictability required for the ordering of human affairs over the course of time and a basis of “public faith in the judiciary as a source of impersonal and reasoned judgments.” Moragne v. States Marine Lines, 398 U. S. 375, 403 *128 (1970).  See also Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106 (1940); Boys Markets v. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235 (1970); Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, 212 (1910); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 405-406 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting).  Woodenly applied, however, it builds a stockade of precedent that confines the law by rules, ill-conceived when promulgated, or if sound in origin, unadaptable to present circumstances.  No precedent is sacrosanct and one should not hesitate to vote to overturn this Court’s previous holdings — old or recent — or reconsider settled dicta where the principles announced prove either practically (e. g., Moragne v. States Marine Lines, supra; Boys Markets v. Retail Clerks, supra), or jurispruden-tially (e. g., Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244, 256 (1969) (dissenting opinion)) unworkable, or no longer suited to contemporary life (e. g., Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 360 (1967) (concurring opinion)).
