**Combined Opinion**
 In the opinion delivered by this court in a former case between different parties, and concerning other land, the second of those sections was not Referred to, and the first was imperfectly quoted (omitting the word “ clearly ” before “appear”) and was treated as of no weight; and it was held, reversing the decision of Judge McCrary in 2 McCrary, 370 , that by the true construction of the will the widow “took under it an estate for life in. the testator’s lands, subject to be divested on her ceasing to be his widow, with power to convey her qualified life estate only; ” and that “ her estate in the land and that of her grantees- determined on her marriage with Pickering.” Giles v. Little, 104 U. S. 299, 300 .  The Supreme Court of Nebraska, in a subsequent case, considered those sections of the statute as controlling the construction of the will, and making it clear that the widow took an estate in fee.  Little v. Giles, 25 Nebraska, 321, 322.  That court was also of opinion that the gift over to the children passed only that portion of the estate, real or personal, not disposed of by the widow during her widowhood; and upon the whole case concluded “ that the intention of the testator was to empower his widow to convey all of his real and personal estate, if she saw fit to do so, and, as she had exercised this right and power before her remarriage, the *377 grantees under her deeds acquired all the title of the testator to such lands.” 25 Nebraska, 327, 328, 334.  The opinion of the Supreme Court of the State appears to have been formed upon full consideration of the difficulties of.  the case; and is entitled to great weight, especially upon the construction of the statute of the State.  Suydam v. Williamson, <citedDecision>24 How. 427</citedDecision> .  And this court, on reconsideration of the ' whole matter, with the aid of the various judicial opinions upon the subject, and of the learned briefs of counsel, is of opinion that the sound construction of this will, as to the extent of the power conferred on the widow, is in accordance with the conclusion of the state court, and not with the former decision of this court, which must, therefore, be considered as overruled.  The testator’s primary object manifestly was to provide for his widow.  He begins by giving her “ all my estate, real and personal,” which of itself would carry a fee, unless restricted by other words.  Lambert v. Paine, 3 Cranch, 97 .  He then- says “ to be and remain hers,” which, upon any possible construction, secures to her the full, use and enjoyment of the estate, while she holds it.  She is also vested, in the most comprehensive terms, “ with full power, right and authority to dispose of the same ” (which, as no less title has yet been' mentioned, naturally means the whole estate) “ as to her shall seem most meet and proper, so long as she shall remain my widow.” This last clause, so far as it controls the previous words, has full effect if construed as limiting the time during which the widow may have the use and enjoyment of the estate, and the power to dispose of it, and not restricting the subject to be disposed'of.
