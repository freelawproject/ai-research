<p id="b712-11">Petitioners, a class of female employees of the Department of Social Services and of the Board of Education of the city of New York, commenced this action under <span class="citation no-link">42 U. S. C. § 1983</span> in July 1971.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The gravamen of the complaint was that the <page-number citation-index="1" label="661">*661</page-number>Board and the Department had as a matter of official policy compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were required for medical reasons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Cleveland Board of Education </em>v. <em>LaFleur, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108913"><a href="/opinion/108913/cleveland-board-of-education-v-lafleur/" aria-description="Citation for case: Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur">414 U. S. 632</a></span> (1974). The suit sought injunctive relief and backpay for periods of unlawful forced leave. Named as defendants in the action were the Department and its Commissioner, the Board and its Chancellor, and the city of New York and its Mayor. In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b713-4">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held moot petitioners’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief since the city of New York and the Board, after the filing of the complaint, had changed their policies relating to maternity leaves so that no pregnant employee would have to take leave unless she was medically unable to continue to perform her job. <span class="citation" data-id="1415269"><a href="/opinion/1415269/monell-v-deptartment-of-social-services-of-new-york/#855" aria-description="Citation for case: Monell v.

The court did conclude, however, that the acts complained of were unconstitutional under <em><span class="citation" data-id="108913"><a href="/opinion/108913/cleveland-board-of-education-v-lafleur/" aria-description="Citation for case: Cleveland Board of Education v.

<p id="b714-5">On appeal, petitioners renewed their arguments that the Board of Education<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was not a “municipality” within the meaning of <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v.

Pape">Pape, supra,</a></span> </em>and that, in any event, the District Court had erred in barring a damages award against the individual defendants. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions. The court first held that the Board of Education was not a “person” under § 1983 because “it performs a vital governmental function . . ., and, significantly, while it has the right to determine how the funds appropriated to it shall be spent ... , it has no final say in deciding what its appropriations shall be.” <span class="citation" data-id="334135"><a href="/opinion/334135/12-fair-emplpraccas-836-11-empl-prac-dec-p-10755-jane-monell-v/#263" aria-description="Citation for case: 12 Fair empl.prac.cas. 836, 11 Empl.

The sole basis for this conclusion was an inference drawn from Congress’ rejection of the “Sherman amendment” to the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871, <span class="citation no-link">17 Stat. 13</span>, the precursor of § 1983.

<p id="b717-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="665">*665</page-number>A fresh analysis of the debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and particularly of the case law which each side mustered in its support, shows, however, that <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v. Pape">Monroe</a></span> </em>incorrectly equated the “obligation” of which Representative Poland spoke with “civil liability.”</p>
<p id="b717-4">A. An Overview</p>
<p id="b717-5">There are three distinct stages in the legislative consideration of the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871. On March 28, 1871, Representative Shellabarger, acting for a House select committee, reported H. R. 320, a bill “to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes.” H. R. 320 contained four sections. Section 1, now codified as <span class="citation no-link">42 U. S. C. § 1983</span>, was the subject of only limited debate and was passed without amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Sections 2 through 4 dealt primarily with the “other purpose” of suppressing Ku Klux Klan violence in the Southern States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The wisdom and constitutionality of these sections — not § 1, now § 1983 — were the subject of almost all congressional debate and each of these sections was amended. The House finished its initial debates on H. R. 320 on April 7, 1871, and one week later the Senate also voted out a bill.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Again, debate on § 1 of the bill was limited and that section was passed as introduced.</p>
<p id="b718-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="666">*666</page-number>Immediately prior to the vote on H. R. 320 in the Senate, Senator Sherman introduced his amendment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This was <em>not </em>an amendment to § 1 of the bill, but was to be added as § 7 at the end of the bill. Under the Senate rules, no discussion of the amendment was allowed and, although attempts were made to amend the amendment, it was passed as introduced. In this form, the amendment did <em>not </em>place liability on municipal corporations, but made any inhabitant of a municipality liable for damage inflicted by persons “riotously and tumultuously assembled.” <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b718-5">The House refused to acquiesce in a number of amendments made by the Senate, including the Sherman amendment, and the respective versions of H. R. 320 were therefore sent to a conference committee. Section 1 of the bill, however, was not a subject of this conference since, as noted, it was passed verbatim as introduced in both Houses of Congress.</p>
<p id="b718-6">On April 18, 1871, the first conference committee completed its work on H. R. 320. The main features of the conference committee draft of the Sherman amendment were these: <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> First, a cause of action was given to persons injured by</p>
<blockquote id="Ae">“any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together . . . with intent to deprive any person of any right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude . . . .”</blockquote>
<p id="b719-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="667">*667</page-number>Second, the bill provided that the action would, be against the county, city, or parish in which the riot had occurred and that it could be maintained by either the person injured or his legal representative. Third, unlike the amendment as proposed, the conference substitute made the government defendant liable on the judgment if it was not satisfied against individual defendants who had committed the violence. If a municipality were liable, the judgment against it could be collected</p>
<blockquote id="b719-4">“by execution, attachment, mandamus, garnishment, or any other proceeding in aid of execution or applicable to the enforcement of judgments against municipal corporations; and such judgment [would become] a lien as well upon all moneys in the treasury of such county, city, or parish, as upon the other property thereof.”</blockquote>
<p id="b719-5">In the ensuing debate on the first conference report, which was the first debate of any kind on the Sherman amendment, Senator Sherman explained that the purpose of his amendment was to enlist the aid of persons of property in the enforcement of the civil rights laws by making their property “responsible” for Ku Klux Klan damage.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Statutes drafted on a similar theory, he stated, had long been in force in England and were in force in 1871 in a number of States.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="668">*668</page-number>Nonetheless there were critical differences between the conference substitute and extant state and English statutes: The conference substitute, unlike most state riot statutes, lacked a short statute of limitations and imposed liability on the government defendant whether or not it had notice of the impending riot, whether or not the municipality was authorized to exercise a police power, whether or not it exerted all reasonable efforts to stop the riot, and whether or not the rioters were caught and punished.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b720-5">The first conference substitute passed the Senate but was rejected by the House. House opponents, within whose ranks were some who had supported § 1, thought the Federal Government could not, consistent with the Constitution, obligate municipal corporations to keep the peace if those corporations were neither so obligated nor so authorized by their state charters. And, because of this constitutional objection, opponents of the Sherman amendment were unwilling to impose damages liability for nonperformance of a duty which Congress could not require municipalities to perform. This position is reflected in Representative Poland's statement that is quoted in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v. Pape">Monroe</a></span>.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>
<p id="b720-6">Because the House rejected the first conference report a second conference was called and it duly issued its report. The second conference substitute for the Sherman amendment abandoned municipal liability and, instead, made “any per<page-number citation-index="1" label="669">*669</page-number>son or persons having knowledge [that a conspiracy to violate civil rights was afoot], and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the same,” who did not attempt to stop the same, liable to any person injured by the conspiracy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The amendment in this form was adopted by both Houses of Congress and is now codified as <span class="citation no-link">42 U. S. C. § 1986</span>.</p>
<p id="b721-4">The meaning of the legislative history sketched above can most readily be developed by first considering the debate on the report of the first conference committee. This debate shows conclusively that the constitutional objections raised against the Sherman amendment — on which our holding in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v. Pape">Monroe</a></span> </em>was based, see <em>supra, </em>at 664 — would not have prohibited congressional creation of a civil remedy against state municipal corporations that infringed federal rights. Because § 1 of the Civil Rights Act does not state expressly that municipal corporations come within its ambit, it is finally necessary to interpret § 1 to confirm that such corporations were indeed intended to be included within the “persons” to whom that section applies.</p>
<p id="b721-5">B. Debate on the First Conference Report</p>
<p id="b721-6">The style of argument adopted by both proponents and opponents of the Sherman amendment in both Houses of Congress was largely legal, with frequent references to cases decided by this Court and the Supreme Courts of the several States. Proponents of the Sherman amendment did not, however, discuss in detail the argument in favor of its constitutionality. Nonetheless, it is possible to piece together such an argument from the debates on the first conference report and those on § 2 of the civil rights bill, which, because it allowed the Federal Government to prosecute crimes “in the States,” had also raised questions of federal power. The account of Representative Shellabarger, the House sponsor of H. R. 320, is the most complete.</p>
<p id="b722-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="670">*670</page-number>Shellabarger began his discussion of H. R. 320 by stating that “there is a domain of constitutional law involved in the right consideration of this measure which is wholly unexplored.” Globe App. 67. There were analogies, however. With respect to the meaning of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and particularly its Privileges or Immunities Clause, Shellabarger relied on the statement of Mr. Justice Washington in <em>Corfield </em>v. <em>Coryell, </em><span class="citation" data-id="9301445"><a href="/opinion/9306338/corfield-v-coryell/" aria-description="Citation for case: Corfield v. Coryell">4 Wash. C. C. 371</a></span> (CC ED Pa. 1825), which defined the privileges protected by Art. IV:</p>
<blockquote id="b722-5">“ What these fundamental privileges are[,] it would perhaps be more tedious than difficult to enumerate. They may, however, be all comprehended under the following general heads: protection by the Government;’ — •</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b722-6">
<em>“Mark that—</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b722-7"><em>“ ‘protection by the Government; </em>the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety ....’” Globe App. 69 (emphasis added), quoting <span class="citation" data-id="9301445"><a href="/opinion/9306338/corfield-v-coryell/#380" aria-description="Citation for case: Corfield v. Coryell">4 Wash. C. C., at 380-381</a></span>.</blockquote>
<p id="b722-8">Building on his conclusion that citizens were owed protection — a conclusion not disputed by opponents of the Sherman amendment<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> — Shellabarger then considered Congress’ role in providing that protection. Here again there were precedents:</p>
<blockquote id="AV">“[Congress has always] assumed to enforce, as against <page-number citation-index="1" label="671">*671</page-number>the States, and also persons, every one of the provisions of the Constitution. Most of the provisions of the Constitution which restrain and directly relate to the States, such as those in [Art. I, § 10,] relate to the divisions of the political powers of the State and General Governments. . . . These prohibitions upon political powers of the States are all of such nature that they can be, and even have been, . . . enforced by the courts of the United States declaring void all State acts of encroachment on Federal powers. Thus, and thus sufficiently, has the United States 'enforced’ these provisions of the Constitution. But there are some that are not of this class. These are where the court secures the rights or the liabilities of persons within the States, as between such persons and the States.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b723-4">"These three are: first, that as to fugitives from justice; [<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>] second, that as to fugitives from service, (or slaves;) [<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>] third, that declaring that the 'citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several <em>States.’[</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>
<blockquote id="b724-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="672">*672</page-number>“And, sir, every one of these' — the only provisions where it was deemed that legislation was required to enforce the constitutional provisions — -the only three where the rights or liabilities of persons in the States, as between these persons and the States, are directly provided for, Congress has by legislation affirmatively interfered to protect . . . such persons.” Globe App. 69-70.</blockquote>
<p id="b724-5">Of legislation mentioned by Shellabarger, the closest analog of the Sherman amendment, ironically, was the statute implementing the fugitives from justice and fugitive slave provisions of Art. IV — the Act of Feb. 12, 1793, <span class="citation no-link">1 Stat. 302</span> — the constitutionality of which had been sustained in 1842, in <em>Prigg </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em><span class="citation" data-id="86231"><a href="/opinion/86231/prigg-v-pennsylvania/" aria-description="Citation for case: Prigg v. Pennsylvania">16 Pet. 539</a></span>. There, Mr. Justice Story, writing for the Court, held that Art. IV gave slaveowners a federal right to the unhindered possession of their slaves in whatever State such slaves might be found. <span class="citation" data-id="86231"><a href="/opinion/86231/prigg-v-pennsylvania/#612" aria-description="Citation for case: Prigg v. Pennsylvania">16 Pet., at 612</a></span>. Because state process for recovering runaway slaves might be inadequate or even hostile to the rights of the slaveowner, the right intended to be conferred could be negated if left to state implementation. <span class="citation" data-id="86231"><a href="/opinion/86231/prigg-v-pennsylvania/#614" aria-description="Citation for case: Prigg v. Pennsylvania"><em>Id., </em>at 614</a></span>. Thus, since the Constitution guaranteed the right and this in turn required a remedy, Story held it to be a “natural inference” that Congress had the power itself to ensure an appropriate (in the Necessary and Proper Clause sense) remedy for the right. <span class="citation" data-id="86231"><a href="/opinion/86231/prigg-v-pennsylvania/#615" aria-description="Citation for case: Prigg v. Pennsylvania"><em>Id., </em>at 615</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b724-6">Building on <em><span class="citation" data-id="86231"><a href="/opinion/86231/prigg-v-pennsylvania/" aria-description="Citation for case: Prigg v. Pennsylvania">Prigg</a></span>, </em>Shellabarger argued that a remedy against municipalities and counties was an appropriate — and hence constitutional — method for ensuring the protection which the Fourteenth Amendment made every citizen’s federal right.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This much was clear from the adoption of such statutes by the several States as devices for suppressing riot.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, said Shellabarger, the only serious question remaining <page-number citation-index="1" label="673">*673</page-number>was “whether, since a county is an integer or part of a State, the United States can impose upon it, as such, <em>any obligations to keep the peace </em>in obedience to United States laws.”<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This he answered affirmatively, citing <em>Board of Comm’rs </em>v. <em>Aspinwall, </em><span class="citation" data-id="87413"><a href="/opinion/87413/the-board-of-commrs-of-knox-county-v-aspinwall/" aria-description="Citation for case: The Board of Commr&#x27;s of Knox County v. Aspinwall">24 How. 376</a></span> (1861), the first of many cases<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> upholding the power of federal courts to enforce the Contract Clause against municipalities.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b725-4">House opponents of the Sherman amendment — whose views are particularly important since only the House voted down the amendment — did not dispute Shellabarger’s claim that the Fourteenth Amendment created a federal right to protection, see n. 21, <em>supra, </em>but they argued that the local units of government upon which the amendment fastened liability were not obligated to keep the peace at state law and further that the Federal Government could not constitutionally require local governments to create police forces, whether this requirement was levied directly, or indirectly by imposing damages for breach of the peace on municipalities. The most complete statement of this position is that of Representative Blair: <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>
<blockquote id="b725-5">“The proposition known as the Sherman amend<page-number citation-index="1" label="674">*674</page-number>ment ... is entirely new.

The parallel of the hundred does not in the least meet the case. The power that laid the obligation upon the hundred first put the duty upon the hundred that it should perform in that regard, and failing to meet the obligation which had been laid upon it, it was very proper that it should suffer damage for its neglect....</blockquote>

<p id="b727-6">Any attempt to impute a unitary constitutional theory to opponents of the Sherman amendment is, of course, fraught <page-number citation-index="1" label="676">*676</page-number>with difficulties, not the least of which is that most Members of Congress did not speak to the issue of the constitutionality of the amendment. Nonetheless, two considerations lead us to conclude that opponents of the Sherman amendment found it unconstitutional substantially because of the reasons stated by Representative Blair: First, Blair’s analysis is precisely that of Poland, whose views were quoted as authoritative in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v.

<p id="b729-4">Had Mr. Justice McLean been correct in his suggestion that, where the Constitution envisioned affirmative government assistance, the States or their officers or instrumentalities could be required to provide it, there would have been little doubt that Congress could have insisted that municipalities afford by “positive” action the protection<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> owed individuals under § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment whether or not municipalities were obligated by state law to keep' the peace.

There, the Court was asked to require Dennison, the Governor of Ohio, to hand over Lago, a fugitive from justice wanted in Kentucky, as required by § 1 of the Act of Feb. 12, 1793,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> which implemented Art. IV, § 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution. Mr. Chief Justice Taney, writing for a unanimous Court, refused to enforce that section of the Act:</p>
<blockquote id="b730-5">“[W]e think it clear, that the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it; for if it possessed this power, it might overload the officer with duties which would fill up' all his time, and disable him from performing his obligations to the State, and might impose on him duties of a character incompatible with the rank and dignity to which he was elevated by the State.” 24 How., at 107-108.</blockquote>
<p id="b730-6">The rationale of <em><span class="citation" data-id="87371"><a href="/opinion/87371/commonwealth-of-ky-v-dennison-governor-c/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON, GOVERNOR, &amp;C.">Dennison</a></span> </em>— that the <em>Nation </em>could not impose duties on state officers since that might impede States in their legitimate activities — is obviously identical to that which animated the decision in <em><span class="citation" data-id="88308"><a href="/opinion/88308/collector-v-day/" aria-description="Citation for case: Collector v.

And, as Blair indicated, municipalities as instrumen-talities through which States executed their policies could be equally disabled from carrying out state policies if they were also obligated to carry out federally imposed duties. Although no one cited <em><span class="citation" data-id="87371"><a href="/opinion/87371/commonwealth-of-ky-v-dennison-governor-c/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON, GOVERNOR, &amp;C.">Dennison</a></span> </em>by name, the principle for which it <page-number citation-index="1" label="679">*679</page-number>stands was well known to Members of Congress,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> many of whom discussed <em><span class="citation" data-id="88308"><a href="/opinion/88308/collector-v-day/" aria-description="Citation for case: Collector v. Day">Day</a></span> </em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as well as a series of State Supreme Court cases<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> in the mid-1860’s which had invalidated a federal tax on the process of state courts on the ground that the tax threatened the independence of a vital state function.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Thus, there was ample support for Blair’s view that the Sherman amendment, by putting municipalities to the Hobson’s choice of keeping the peace or paying civil damages, attempted to impose obligations on municipalities by indirection that could not be imposed directly, thereby threatening to “destroy the government of the States.” Globe 795.</p>
<p id="b731-4">If municipal liability under § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 created a similar Hobson’s choice, we might conclude, as <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v. Pape">Monroe</a></span> </em>did, that Congress could not have intended municipalities to be among the “persons” to which that section applied. But this is not the case.</p>
<p id="b731-5">Hirst, opponents expressly distinguished between imposing an obligation to keep the peace and merely imposing civil liability for damages on a municipality that was obligated by state law to keep the peace, but which had not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Representative Poland, for example, reasoning from Contract Clause precedents, indicated that Congress could constitutionally confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to entertain suits seeking to hold municipalities <page-number citation-index="1" label="680">*680</page-number>liable for using their authorized powers in violation of the Constitution — which is as far as § 1 of the Civil Nights Act went:</p>
<blockquote id="b732-5">“I presume . . . that where a State had imposed a duty [to keep the peace] upon [a] municipality ... an action would be allowed to be maintained against them in the courts of the United States under the ordinary restrictions as to jurisdiction. But the enforcing a liability, existing by their own contract, or by a State law, in the courts, is a very widely different thing from devolving a new duty or liability upon them by the national Government, which has no power either to create or destroy them, and no power or control over them whatever.” Globe 794.</blockquote>
<p id="b732-6">Representative Burchard agreed:</p>
<blockquote id="b732-7">“[Tjhere is no duty imposed by the Constitution of the United States, or usually by State laws, upon a county to protect the people of that county against the commission of the offenses herein enumerated, such as the burning of buildings or any other injury to property or injury to person. Police powers are not conferred upon counties as corporations; they are conferred upon cities that have qualified legislative power. And so far as cities are concerned, where the equal protection required to be afforded by a State is imposed upon a city by State laws, perhaps the United States courts could enforce its performance. But counties ... do not have any control of <em>the </em>police . . . .” <em>Id., </em>at 795.</blockquote>
<p id="b732-8">See also the views of Rep. Willard, discussed at n. 30, <em>supra.</em></p>
<p id="b732-9">Second, the doctrine of dual sovereignty apparently put no limit on the power of federal courts to enforce the Constitution against municipalities that violated it. Under the theory of dual sovereignty set out in <em><span class="citation" data-id="86231"><a href="/opinion/86231/prigg-v-pennsylvania/" aria-description="Citation for case: Prigg v. Pennsylvania">Prigg</a></span>, </em>this is quite understandable. So long as federal courts were vindicating the Federal Constitution, they were providing the “positive” government action <page-number citation-index="1" label="681">*681</page-number>required to protect federal constitutional rights and no question was raised of enlisting the States in “positive” action. The limits of the principles announced in <em><span class="citation" data-id="87371"><a href="/opinion/87371/commonwealth-of-ky-v-dennison-governor-c/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON, GOVERNOR, &amp;C.">Dennison</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="88308"><a href="/opinion/88308/collector-v-day/" aria-description="Citation for case: Collector v. Day">Day</a></span> </em>are not so well defined in logic, but are clear as a matter of history. It must be remembered that the same Court which rendered <em><span class="citation" data-id="88308"><a href="/opinion/88308/collector-v-day/" aria-description="Citation for case: Collector v. Day">Day</a></span> </em>also vigorously enforced the Contract Clause against municipalities — an enforcement effort which included various forms of “positive” relief, such as ordering that taxes be levied and collected to discharge federal-court judgments, once a constitutional infraction was found.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Thus, federal judicial enforcement of the Constitution's express limits on state power, since it was done so frequently, must, notwithstanding anything said in <em><span class="citation" data-id="87371"><a href="/opinion/87371/commonwealth-of-ky-v-dennison-governor-c/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON, GOVERNOR, &amp;C.">Dennison</a></span> </em>or <em><span class="citation" data-id="88308"><a href="/opinion/88308/collector-v-day/" aria-description="Citation for case: Collector v. Day">Day</a></span>, </em>have been permissible, at least so long as the interpretation of the Constitution was left in the hands of the judiciary. Since § 1 of the Civil Rights Act simply conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts to enforce § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment — a situation precisely analogous to the grant of diversity jurisdiction under which the Contract Clause was enforced against munici<page-number citation-index="1" label="682">*682</page-number>palities — there is no reason to suppose that opponents of the Sherman amendment would have found any constitutional barrier to § 1 suits against municipalities.</p>
<p id="b734-5">Finally, the very votes of those Members of Congress, who opposed the Sherman amendment but who had voted for § 1, confirm that the liability imposed by § 1 was something very different from that imposed by the amendment. Section 1 without question could be used to obtain a damages judgment against state or municipal <em>officials </em>who violated federal constitutional rights while acting under color of law.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> However, for <em>Prigg-Dennison-Day </em>purposes, as Blair and others recognized,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> there was no distinction of constitutional magnitude between officers and agents — including corporate agents — of the State: Both were state instrumentalities and the State could be impeded no matter over which sort of instrumentality the Federal Government sought to assert its power. <em><span class="citation" data-id="87371"><a href="/opinion/87371/commonwealth-of-ky-v-dennison-governor-c/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commonwealth of Ky. v.

Day">Day</a></span>, </em>after all, were not suits against municipalities but against <em>officers, </em>and Blair was quite conscious that he was extending these cases by applying them to municipal corporations.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of § <em>1 </em>— inter <em>alia, </em>complaining that it would be applied to state officers, see Globe App. 217 — and who opposed both § 1 and the Sherman amendment, the latter on <em><span class="citation" data-id="86231"><a href="/opinion/86231/prigg-v-pennsylvania/" aria-description="Citation for case: Prigg v. Pennsylvania">Prigg</a></span> </em>grounds, agreed unequivocally that § 1 was constitu<page-number citation-index="1" label="683">*683</page-number>tional.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Those who voted for § 1 must similarly have believed in its constitutionality despite <em>Prigg, Dennison, </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="88308"><a href="/opinion/88308/collector-v-day/" aria-description="Citation for case: Collector v.

<p id="b735-4">C. Debate on § 1 of the Civil Rights Bill</p>
<p id="b735-5">From the foregoing discussion, it is readily apparent that nothing said in debate on the Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a municipality liable under § 1 of the Civil Rights Act for its own violations of the Fourteenth Amendment. The question remains, however, whether the general language describing those to be liable under § 1 — “any person” — covers more than natural persons. An examination of the debate on § 1 and application of appropriate rules of construction show unequivocally that § 1 was intended to cover legal as well as natural persons.</p>
<p id="b735-6">Representative Shellabarger was the first to explain the function of § 1:</p>
<blockquote id="b735-7">“[Section 1] not only provides a civil remedy for persons whose former condition may have been that of slaves, but also to all people where, under color of State law, they or any of them may be deprived of rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution by reason and virtue of their national citizenship.” Globe App. 68.</blockquote>
<p id="b735-8">By extending a remedy to all people, including whites, § 1 went beyond the mischief to which the remaining sections of the 1871 Act were addressed. Representative Shellabarger also stated without reservation that the constitutionality of § 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 controlled the constitutionality of § 1 of the 1871 Act, and that the former had been <page-number citation-index="1" label="684">*684</page-number>approved by “the supreme courts of at least three States of this Union” and by Mr. Justice Swayne, sitting on circuit, who had concluded: “'We have no doubt of the constitutionality of every provision of this act/ ” Globe App. 68. Representative Shellabarger then went on to describe how the courts would and should interpret § 1:</p>
<blockquote id="b736-5">“This act is remedial, and in aid of the preservation of human liberty and human rights. All statutes and constitutional provisions authorizing such statutes are liberally and beneficently construed. It would be most strange and, in civilized law, monstrous were this not the rule of interpretation. As has been again and again decided by your own Supreme Court of the United States, and everywhere else where there is wise judicial interpretation, the largest latitude consistent with the words employed is uniformly given in construing such statutes and constitutional provisions as are meant to protect and defend and give remedies for their wrongs to all the people. . . . Chief Justice Jay and also Story say:</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b736-6">“ 'Where a power is remedial in its nature there is much reason to contend that it ought to be construed liberally, and it is generally adopted in the interpretation of laws.’ — 1 <em>Story on </em>Constitution, sec. 429.” Globe App., at 68.</blockquote>
<p id="b736-7">The sentiments expressed in Representative Shellabarger’s opening speech were echoed by Senator Edmunds, the manager of H. R. 320 in the Senate:</p>
<blockquote id="b736-8">“The first section is one that I believe nobody objects to, as defining the rights secured by the Constitution of the United States when they are assailed by any State law or under color of any State law, and it is merely carrying out the principles of the civil rights bill [of 1866], which have since become a part of the Constitution.” Globe 568.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b737-2"><page-number citation-index="1" label="685">*685</page-number>“[Section 1 is] so very simple and really reenact[s] the Constitution.” <em>Id., </em>at 569.</blockquote>
<p id="b737-3">And he agreed that the bill “secure[d] the rights of white men as much as of colored men.” <em>Id., </em>at 696.</p>
<p id="b737-4">In both Houses, statements of the supporters of § 1 corroborated that Congress, in enacting § 1, intended to give a broad remedy for violations of federally protected civil rights.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Moreover, since municipalities through their official <page-number citation-index="1" label="686">*686</page-number>acts could, equally with natural persons, create the harms intended to be remedied by § 1, and, further, since Congress intended § 1 to be broadly construed, there is no reason to suppose that municipal corporations would have been excluded from the sweep of § 1. Cf., <em>e. g., Ex parte Virginia, </em><span class="citation" data-id="90041"><a href="/opinion/90041/ex-parte-virginia/#346" aria-description="Citation for case: Ex Parte Virginia">100 U.

City of Los Angeles">227 U. S. 278, 286-287, 294-296</a></span> (1913). One need not rely on this inference alone, however, for the debates show that Members of Congress understood “persons” to include municipal corporations.</p>
<p id="b738-5">Representative Bingham, for example, in discussing § 1 of the bill, explained that he had drafted § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment with the case of <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore, </em><span class="citation" data-id="85827"><a href="/opinion/85827/barron-ex-rel-tiernan-v-mayor-of-baltimore/" aria-description="Citation for case: Barron Ex Rel.

Bingham’s further remarks clearly indicate his view that such takings by cities, as had occurred in <em><span class="citation" data-id="85827"><a href="/opinion/85827/barron-ex-rel-tiernan-v-mayor-of-baltimore/" aria-description="Citation for case: Barron Ex Rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore">Barron</a></span>, </em>would be redressable under § 1 of the bill. See Globe App. 85. More generally, and as Bingham’s remarks confirm, § 1 of the bill would logically be the vehicle by which Congress provided redress for takings, since that section provided the only civil remedy for Fourteenth Amendment violations and that Amendment unequivocally prohibited uncompensated takings.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Given this purpose, it beggars reason to suppose that Congress would have exempted municipalities from suit, insisting instead that compensation for a taking come from an officer in his individual capacity rather than from the government unit that had the benefit of the property taken.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b739-4">In addition, by 1871, it was well understood that corporations should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis. This had not always been so. When this Court first considered the question of the status of corporations, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, denied that corporations “as such” were persons as that term was used in Art. Ill and the Judiciary Act of 1789.

<p id="b742-3">Our analysis of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 compels the conclusion that Congress <em>did </em>intend municipalities and other local government units to be included ' among those persons to whom § 1983 applies.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Local govern- ■ ing bodies,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> therefore, can be sued directly under § 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision ^.officially adopted and promulgated by that body’s officers. \ Moreover, although the touchstone of the § 1983 action against a government body is an allegation that official policy is responsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the Constitution, local governments, like every other § 1983 “person,” by the very terms of the statute, may be sued for constitu<page-number citation-index="1" label="691">*691</page-number>tional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental “custom” even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body’s official decisionmaking channels. As Mr. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, said in <em>Adickes </em>v. <em>S. H. Kress &amp; Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="108153"><a href="/opinion/108153/adickes-v-s-h-kress-co/#167" aria-description="Citation for case: Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co.">398 U. S. 144, 167-168</a></span> (1970): “Congress included customs and usages [in § 1983] because of the persistent and widespread discriminatory practices of state officials .... Although not authorized by written law, such practices of state officials could well be so permanent and well settled as to constitute a 'custom or usage’ with the force of law.” <footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b743-4">On the other hand, the language of § 1983, read against the background of the same legislative history, compels the conclusion that Congress did not intend municipalities to be held liable unless action pursuant to official municipal policy-/of some nature caused a constitutional tort. In particular, we conclude that a municipality cannot be held liable <em>solely </em>because it employs a tortfeasor — or, in other words, a munici- ^ pality cannot be held liable under § 1983 on a <em>respondeat '■ superior </em>theory.</p>
<p id="b743-5">We begin with the language of § 1983 as originally passed:</p>
<blockquote id="b743-6"><em>“[A]ny person who, </em>under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, <em>shall subject, or cause to be subjected, </em>any person ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States, shall, any such <page-number citation-index="1" label="692">*692</page-number>law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of the State to the contrary notwithstanding, be liable to the party injured in any action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress <em>. . . </em><span class="citation no-link">17 Stat. 13</span> (emphasis added).</blockquote>
<p id="ASr">The italicized language plainly imposes liability on a government that, under color of some official policy, “causes” an employee to violate another’s constitutional rights. At the same time, that language cannot be easily read to impose liability vicariously on governing bodies solely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor. Indeed, the fact that Congress did specifically provide that A’s tort became B’s liability if B “caused” A to subject another to a tort suggests that Congress did not intend § 1983 liability to attach where such causation was absent.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> See <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Goode, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109349"><a href="/opinion/109349/rizzo-v-goode/#370" aria-description="Citation for case: Rizzo v. Goode">423 U. S. 362, 370-371</a></span> (1976).</p>
<p id="b745-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="693">*693</page-number>Equally important, creation of a federal law of <em>respondeat superior </em>would have raised all the constitutional problems associated with the obligation to keep the peace, an obligation Congress chose not to impose because it thought imposition of such an obligation unconstitutional. To this day, there is disagreement about the basis for imposing liability on an employer for the torts of an employee when the sole nexus between the employer and the tort is the fact of the employer-employee relationship. See W. Prosser, Law of Torts § 69, p. 469 (4th ed. 1971). Nonetheless, two justifications tend to stand out. First is the common-sense notion that no matter how blameless an employer appears to be in an individual case, accidents might nonetheless be reduced if employers had to bear the cost of accidents. See, <em>e. g., ibid.; </em>2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Law of Torts, §26.3, pp. 1368-1369 (1956). Second is the argument that the cost of accidents should be <page-number citation-index="1" label="694">*694</page-number>spread to the community as a whole on an insurance theory. See, <em>e. g., id., </em>§ 26.5; Prosser, <em>supra, </em>at 459.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b746-6">The first justification is of the same sort that was offered for statutes like the Sherman amendment: “The obligation to make compensation for injury resulting from riot is, by arbitrary enactment of statutes, affirmatory law, and the reason of passing the statute is to secure a more perfect police regulation.” Globe 777 (Sen. Frelinghuysen). This justification was obviously insufficient to sustain the amendment against perceived constitutional difficulties and there is no reason to suppose that a more general liability imposed for a similar reason would have been thought less constitutionally objectionable. The second justification was similarly put forward as a justification for the Sherman amendment: “we do not look upon [the Sherman amendment] as a punishment .... It is a mutual insurance.” <em>Id., </em>at 792 (Rep. Butler). Again, this justification was insufficient to sustain the amendment.</p>
<p id="AGTd">We conclude, therefore, that a local government may not be sued under § 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a government’s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the. government as an entity is responsible under § 1983. Since this case unquestionably involves official policy as the moving force of the constitutional violation found by the District Court, see <em>supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index="1" label="695">*695</page-number>660-662, and n. 2, we must reverse the judgment below. In so doing, we have no occasion to address, and do not address, what the full contours of municipal liability under § 1983 may be. We have attempted only to sketch so much of the § 1983 cause of action against a local government as is apparent from the history of the 1871 Act and our prior cases, and we expressly leave further development of this action to another day.</p>

<p id="b747-5">Although we have stated that <em>stare decisis </em>has more force in statutory analysis than in constitutional adjudication because, in the former situation, Congress can correct our mistakes through legislation, see, <em>e. g., Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108990"><a href="/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/#671" aria-description="Citation for case: Edelman v.

<p id="b748-5">Second, the principle of blanket immunity established in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v. Pape">Monroe</a></span> </em>cannot be cabined short of school boards. Yet such an extension would itself be inconsistent with recent expressions of congressional intent. In the wake of our decisions, Congress not only has shown no hostility to federal-court decisions against school boards, but it has indeed rejected efforts to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over school boards.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Moreover, recognizing that school boards are often <page-number citation-index="1" label="697">*697</page-number>defendants in school desegregation suits, which have almost without exception been § 1983 suits, Congress has twice passed legislation authorizing grants to school boards to assist them in complying with federal-court decrees.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Finally, in <page-number citation-index="1" label="698">*698</page-number>regard to the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, <span class="citation no-link">90 Stat. 2641</span>, <span class="citation no-link">42 U.

Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).</blockquote>
<p id="b751-5">Far from showing that Congress has relied on <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v. Pape">Monroe</a></span>, </em>therefore, events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v.

<p id="b751-6">Third, municipalities can assert no reliance claim which can <page-number citation-index="1" label="700">*700</page-number>support an absolute immunity. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v. Pape">Monroe</a></span>, </em>“[t]his is not an area of commercial law in which, presumably, individuals may have arranged their affairs in reliance on the expected stability of decision.” <span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/#221" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v. Pape">365 U. S., at 221-222</a></span> (dissenting in part). Indeed, municipalities simply cannot “arrange their affairs” on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely since injunctive suits against local officials under § 1983 would prohibit any such arrangement. And it scarcely need be mentioned that nothing in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v. Pape">Monroe</a></span> </em>encourages municipalities to violate constitutional rights or even suggests that such violations are anything other than completely wrong.</p>
<p id="b752-5">Finally, even under the most stringent test for the propriety of overruling a statutory decision proposed by Mr. Justice Harlan in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v.

Pape">Monroe</a></span> </em>insofar as it holds that local governments are not “persons” who may be defendants in § 1983 suits is clearly proper. It is simply beyond doubt that, under the 1871 Congress’ view of the law, were § 1983 liability unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state officers. Yet everyone — proponents and opponents alike — knew § 1983 would be applied to state officers and nonetheless stated that § 1983 was constitutional. See <em>supra, </em>at 680-682. And, moreover, there can be no doubt that § 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected <page-number citation-index="1" label="701">*701</page-number>rights. Therefore, absent a clear statement in the legislative history supporting the conclusion that § 1 was not to apply to the official acts of a municipal corporation — which simply is not present — there is no justification for excluding municipalities from the “persons” covered by § 1.</p>
<p id="b753-4">For the reasons stated above, therefore, we hold that <em>stare decisis </em>does not bar our overruling of <em><span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/" aria-description="Citation for case: Monroe v.

<p id="b725-9"> Others taking a view similar to Representative Blair’s included: Representative Willard, see <em>id., </em>at 791; Representative Poland, see <em>id., </em>at 794; Representative Burchard, see <em>id., </em>at 795; Representative Farnsworth, see <em>id., </em>at 799. Representative Willard also took a somewhat different position: He thought that the Constitution would not allow the Federal <page-number citation-index="1" label="674">*674</page-number>Government to dictate the manner in which a State fulfilled its obligation of protection. That is, he thought it a matter of state discretion whether it delegated the peacekeeping power to a municipal or county corporation, to a sheriff, etc. He did not doubt, however, that the Federal Government could impose on the <em>States </em>the obligation imposed by the Sherman amendment, and presumably he would have enforced the amendment against a municipal corporation to which the peacekeeping obligation had been delegated. See <em>id., </em>at 791.</p>
<p id="b726-7">Opponents of the Sherman amendment in the Senate agreed with Blair that Congress had no power to pass the Sherman amendment because it fell outside limits on national power implicit in the federal structure of the Constitution and recognized in, <em>e. g., Collector </em>v. <em>Day, </em><span class="citation" data-id="88308"><a href="/opinion/88308/collector-v-day/" aria-description="Citation for case: Collector v. Day">11 Wall. 113</a></span> (1871). However, the Senate opponents focused not on the amendment’s attempt to obligate municipalities to keep the peace, but on the lien created by the amendment, which ran against <em>all </em>money and property of a defendant municipality, including property held for public purposes, such as jails or courthouses. Opponents argued that such a lien once entered would have the effect of making it impossible for the municipality to function, since no one would trade with it. See, <em>e. g., </em>Globe 762 (Sen. Stevenson); <em>id., </em>at 763 (Sen. Casserly). Moreover, everyone knew that sound policy prevented execution against public property since this, too, was needed if local government was to survive. See, <em>e. g., ibid. </em>See also <em>Meriwether </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em><span class="citation" data-id="90262"><a href="/opinion/90262/meriwether-v-garrett/#501" aria-description="Citation for case: Meriwether v.

Dillon, The Law of Municipal Corporations §§445-446 (1873 ed.) (same).</p>
<p id="b726-8">Although the arguments of the Senate opponents appear to be a correct analysis of then-controlling constitutional and common-law principles, their arguments are not relevant to an analysis of the constitutionality of § 1 of the Civil Rights Act since any judgment under that section, as in any civil suit in the federal courts in 1871, would have been enforced pursuant to <em>state </em>laws under the Process Acts of 1792 and 1828.

<p id="b733-4"> See cases cited in n. 28, <em>supra. </em>Since this Court granted unquestionably “positive” relief in Contract Clause cases, it appears that the distinction between the Sherman amendment and those cases was not that the former created a positive obligation whereas the latter imposed only a negative restraint. Instead, the distinction must have been that a violation of the Constitution was the predicate for “positive” relief in the Contract Clause cases, whereas the Sherman amendment imposed damages without regard to whether a local government was in any way at fault for the breach of the peace for which it was to be held for damages. See <em>supra, </em>at 668. While no one stated this distinction expressly during the debates, the inference is strong that Congressmen in 1871 would have drawn this distinction since it explains why Representatives Poland, Burchard, and Willard, see <em>supra, </em>at 680, could oppose the amendment while at the same time saying that the Federal Government might impose damages on a local government that had defaulted in a state-imposed duty to keep the peace, and it also explains why everyone agreed that a state or municipal officer could constitutionally be held liable under § 1 for violations of the Constitution.

<p id="b741-6"> In considering the effect of the Act of Feb. 25, 1871, in <em>Monroe, </em>however, Mr. Justice Douglas, apparently focusing on the word “may,” stated: “[T]his definition [of person] is merely an allowable, not a mandatory, one.” 365 U. S., at 191. A review of the legislative history of the Dictionary Act shows this conclusion to be incorrect.</p>
<p id="b741-7">There is no express reference in the legislative history to the definition of “person,” but Senator Trumbull, the Act’s sponsor, discussed the phrase “words importing the masculine gender <em>may </em>be applied to. females,” (emphasis added), which immediately precedes the definition of “person,” and stated:</p>
<blockquote id="b741-8">“The only object [of the Act] is to get rid of a great deal of verbosity in our statutes by providing that when the word ‘he’ is used it <em>shall </em>include females as well as males.” Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 775 (1871) (emphasis added).</blockquote>
<p id="b741-9">Thus, in Trumbull’s view the word “may” meant “shall.” Such a mandatory use of the extended meanings of the words defined by the Act is also required for it to perform its intended function — to be a guide to “rules of construction” of Acts of Congress. See <em>ibid, </em>(remarks of Sen. Trumbull). Were the defined words “allowable, [but] not mandatory” constructions, as <em>Monroe </em>suggests, there would be no “rules” at all. Instead, Congress must have intended the definitions of the Act to apply across-the-board except where the Act by its terms called for a deviation from this practice — “[where] the context shows that [defined] words were to be used in a more limited sense.” Certainly this is how the <em>Northwestern Fertilizing </em>court viewed the matter. Since there is nothing in the “context” of § 1 of the Civil Rights Act calling for a restricted <page-number citation-index="1" label="690">*690</page-number>interpretation of the word “person,” the language of that section should prima facie be construed to include “bodies politic” among the entities that could be sued.</p>

<p id="b744-7"> Support for such a conclusion can be found in the legislative history. As we have indicated, there is virtually no discussion of § 1 of the Civil Rights Act. Again, however, Congress’ treatment of the Sherman amendment gives a clue to whether it would have desired to impose <em>respondeat superior </em>liability.</p>
<p id="b744-8">The primary constitutional justification for the Sherman amendment was that it was a necessary and proper remedy for the failure of localities to protect citizens as the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required. See <em>supra, </em>at 670-673. And according to Sherman, Shellabarger, and Edmunds, the amendment came into play only when a locality was at fault or had knowingly neglected its duty to provide protection. See Globe 761 (Sen. Sherman); <em>id., </em>at 756 (Sen. Edmunds); <em>id., </em>at 751-752 (Rep. Shellabarger). But other proponents of the amendment apparently viewed it as a form of vicarious liability for the unlawful acts of the citizens of the locality. See <em>id., </em>at 792 (Rep. Butler). And whether intended or not, the amendment as drafted did impose a species of vicarious liability on municipalities since it could be construed to impose liability even if a municipality did not know of an impending or ensuing riot or did not have the wherewithal to do anything about it. Indeed, the amendment held a municipality hable even if it had done everything in its <page-number citation-index="1" label="693">*693</page-number>power to curb the riot. See <em>supra, </em>at 668; Globe 761 (Sen. Stevenson); <em>id., </em>at 771 (Sen. Thurman); <em>id., </em>at 788 (Rep. Kerr); <em>id., </em>at 791 (Rep. Willard). While the first conference substitute was rejected principally on constitutional grounds, see <em>id., </em>at 804 (Rep. Poland), it is plain from the text of the second conference substitute — which limited liability to those who, having the power to intervene against Ku Klux Klan violence, “neglect[ed] or refuse[d] so to do,” see Appendix to this opinion, <em>infra, </em>at 704, and which was enacted as § 6 of the 1871 Act and is now codified as <span class="citation no-link">42 U. S. C. § 1986</span> — that Congress also rejected those elements of vicarious liability contained in the first conference substitute even while accepting the basic principle that the inhabitants of a community were bound to provide protection against the Ku Klux Klan. Strictly speaking, of course, the fact that Congress refused to impose vicarious liability for the wrongs of a few private citizens does not conclusively establish that it would similarly have refused to impose vicarious liability for the torts of a municipality’s employees. Nonetheless, when Congress’ rejection of the only form of vicarious liability presented to it is combined with the absence of any language in § 1983 which can easily be construed to create <em>respondeat superior </em>Lability, the inference that Congress did not intend to impose such liability is quite strong.</p>

<p id="AJL"> In 1972, spurred by a finding “that the process of eliminating or preventing minority group isolation and improving the quality of education for all children often involves the expenditure of additional funds to which local educational agencies do not have access,” <span class="citation no-link">86 Stat. 354</span>, <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 1601</span> (a) (1976 ed.), Congress passed the Emergency School Aid Act. Section 706 (a)(1) (A) (i) of that Act, <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 1605</span> (a) (1) (A) (i) (1976 ed.), authorizes the Assistant Secretary</p>

<p id="AIO">A “local educational agency” is defined by <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 1619</span> (8) (1976 ed.) as “a public board of education or other public authority legally constituted within a State for either administrative control or direction of, public elementary or secondary schools in a city, county, township, school district, or other political subdivision of a State, or a federally recognized Indian reservation, or such combination of school districts, or counties as are recognized in a State as an administrative agency for its public elementary or secondary schools, or a combination of local educational agencies . . . .” Congress thus clearly recognized that school boards were often parties to federal school desegregation suits. In § 718 of the Act, <span class="citation no-link">86 Stat. 369</span>, <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 1617</span> (1976 ed.), Congress gave its explicit approval to the institution of federal desegregation suits against school boards — presumably under § 1983. Section 718 provides:</p>
<blockquote id="AdL">“Upon the entry of a final order <em>by a court of the United States against a local educational agency </em>... for discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in violation of . . . the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States . . . the court . . . may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.” (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
<p id="AK">Two years later in the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, Congress found that “the implementation of desegregation plans that require extensive student transportation has, in many cases, required <em>local educational agencies </em>to expend large amounts of funds, thereby depleting their financial resources . . . .” <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 1702</span> (a) (3) (1976 ed.). (Emphasis added.) Congress did not respond by declaring that school boards were not subject to suit under § 1983 or any other federal statute, “but simply [legislated] revised evidentiary standards and remedial priorities to be employed by the courts in deciding suph cases.” Brief for National Education Assn, et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>15-16. Indeed, Congress expressly reiterated that a cause of action, cognizable in the federal courts, exists for discrimination in the public school context. <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. §§ 1703</span>, <page-number citation-index="1" label="699">*699</page-number>1706, 1708, 1710, 1718 (1976 ed.). The Act assumes that school boards will usually be the defendants in such suits. For example, § 211 of the Act, <span class="citation no-link">88 Stat. 516</span>, as set forth in <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 1710</span> (1976 ed.), provides:</p>

<blockquote id="AvI">“ (a) gives to the appropriate educational agency notice of the condition or conditions which, in his judgment, constitute a violation of part 2 [the prohibitions against discrimination in public education].” Section 219 of the Act, -20 II. S.
