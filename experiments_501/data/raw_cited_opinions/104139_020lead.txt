<p id="AH6">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b285-4">This case is here to review judgments of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, affirming convictions for bigamous cohabitation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assailed on the ground that full faith and credit, as required by the Constitution of the United States, was not accorded divorces decreed by one of the courts of Nevada. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>317 U. S. 287, decided an earlier aspect of the controversy. It was there held that a divorce granted by Nevada, on a finding that one spouse was domiciled in Nevada, must be respected in North Carolina, where Nevada’s finding of domicil was not questioned, though the other spouse had neither appeared nor been served with process in Nevada and though recognition of such a divorce offended the policy of North Carolina. The record then before us did not present the question whether North Carolina had the power “to refuse full faith and credit to Nevada divorce decrees because, contrary to the findings of the Nevada court, North Carolina finds that no <em>bona fide </em>domicil was acquired in Nevada.” <em>Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra, </em>at 302. This is the precise issue which has emerged after retrial of the cause following our reversal. Its obvious importance brought the case here. 322 U. S. 725.</p>
<p id="b285-5">The implications of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Article IV, § 1 of the Constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> first received the sharp-<page-number citation-index="1" label="228">*228</page-number>analysis of this Court in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>18 Wall. 457. Theretofore, uncritical notions about the scope of that Clause had been expressed in the early case of <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Duryee, </em>7 Cranch 481. The “doctrine” of that case, as restated in another early case, was that “the judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect, in every other court in the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced.” <em>Hampton </em>v, <em>M’Connel, </em>3 Wheat. 234, 235. This utterance, when put to' the test, as it was in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Whitman, supra, </em>was found to be too loose. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Whitman </em>made it clear that the doctrine of <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Duryee </em>comes into operation only when, in the language of Kent, “the jurisdiction of the court in another state is not impeached, either as to the subject matter or the person.” Only then is “the record of the judgment . . . entitled to full faith and credit.” 1 Kent, Commentaries (2d ed., 1832)* 261 n. b. The essence of the matter was thus put in what <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Whitman </em>adopted from Story: “‘The Constitution did not mean to confer [upon the States] a new power or jurisdiction, but simply to regulate the effect of the acknowledged jurisdiction over persons and things within their territory.’ ” <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 18 Wall. 457, 462. In short, the Full Faith and Credit Clause puts the Constitution behind a judgment instead of the too fluid, ill-defined concept of “comity.” <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>
<p id="b287-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="229">*229</page-number>But the Clause does not make a sister-State judgment a judgment in another State. The proposal to do so was rejected by the Philadelphia Convention. 2 Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, 447-48.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> “To give it the force of a judgment in another state, it must be made a judgment there.” <em>M’Elmoyle </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>13 Pet. 312, 325. It can be made a judgment there only if the court purporting to render the original judgment had power to render such a judgment. A judgment in one State is conclusive upon the merits in every other State, but only if the court of the first State had power to pass on the merits — had jurisdiction, that is, to render the judgment.</p>
<p id="b287-4">“It is too late now to deny the right collaterally to impeach a decree of divorce made in another State, by proof that the court had no jurisdiction, even when the record purports to show jurisdiction . . .” It was “too late” more than forty- years ago. <em>German Savings Society </em>v. <em>Dormitzer, </em>192 U. S. 125, 128.</p>
<p id="b287-5">Under our system of law, judicial power to grant a divorce — jurisdiction, strictly speaking — is founded on domicil. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>181 U. S. 175; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>188 U. S. 14. The framers of the Constitution were familiar with this jurisdictional prerequisite, and since 1789 neither this Court nor any other court in the English-speaking world has questioned it. Domicil implies a nexus between person and place of such permanence as to control the creation of legal relations and responsibilities of the utmost significance. The domicil of one spouse within a State gives power to that State, we have held, to dis<page-number citation-index="1" label="230">*230</page-number>solve a marriage wheresoever contracted. In view of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra, </em>the jurisdictional requirement of domicil is freed from confusing refinements about “matrimonial domicil,” see <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>305 U. S. 32, 41, and the like. Divorce, like marriage, is of concern not merely to the immediate parties. It affects personal rights of the deepest significance. It also touches basic interests of society. Since divorce, like marriage, creates a new status, every consideration of policy makes it desirable that the effect should be the same wherever the question arises.</p>
<p id="b288-5">It is one thing to reopen an issue that has been settled after appropriate opportunity to present their contentions has been afforded to all who had an interest in its adjudication. This applies also to jurisdictional questions. After a contest these cannot be relitigated as between the parties. <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>166 U. S. 506, 517; <em>Chicago Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cherry, </em>244 U. S. 25, 30 ; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, supra. </em>But those not parties to a litigation ought not to be foreclosed by the interested actions of others; especially not a State which is concerned with the vindication of its own social policy and has no means, certainly no effective means, to protect that interest against the selfish action of those outside its borders. The State of domiciliary origin should not be bound by an unfounded, even if not collusive, recital in the record of a court of another State. <em>1 </em>As to the truth or existence of a fact, like that of domicil, upon which depends the power to exert judicial authority, a State not a party to the exertion of such judicial authority in another State but seriously affected by it has a right, when asserting its own unquestioned authority, to ascertain the truth or existence of that crucial fact.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b289-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="231">*231</page-number>These considerations of policy are equally applicable whether power was assumed by the court of the first State or claimed after inquiry. This may lead, no doubt, to conflicting determinations of what judicial power is founded upon. Such conflict is inherent in the practical application of the concept of domicil in the context of our federal system.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Worcester County Co. </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>302 U. S. 292; <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>306 U. S. 398; <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>314 U. S. 441. What was said in <em>Worcester County Co. </em>v. <em>Riley, supra, </em>is pertinent here. “Neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the full faith and credit clause requires uniformity in the decisions of the courts of different states as to the place of domicil, where the exertion of state power is dependent upon domicil within its boundaries.” 302 U. S. 292, 299. If a finding by the court of one State that domicil in another State has been abandoned were conclusive upon the old domiciliary State, the policy of each State in matters of most intimate concern could be subverted by the policy of every other State. This Court has long ago denied the existence of such destructive power. The issue has a far reach. For domicil is the foundation of probate jurisdiction precisely as it is that of divorce. The ruling in <em>Tilt </em>v. <em>Kelsey, </em>207 U. S. 43, regarding the probate of a will, is equally applicable to a sister-State divorce decree: “the full faith and credit due to the proceedings of the New Jersey court do not require that the courts of New York shall be bound by its adjudication on the question of domicil. On the contrary, it is open to the courts of any State in the trial of a collateral issue to determine upon the evidence produced the true domicil of the deceased.” 207 U. S. 43, 53.</p>
<p id="b290-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="232">*232</page-number>Although it is now settled that a suit for divorce is not an ordinary adversary proceeding, it does not promote analysis, as was recently pointed out, to label divorce proceedings as actions <em>in </em>rem. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra, </em>at 297. But insofar as a divorce decree partakes of some of the characteristics of a decree <em>in rem, </em>it is misleading to say that all the world is party to a proceeding <em>in rem. </em>See <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>140 Mass. 411, 413, 5 N. E. 265, quoted in <em>Tilt </em>v. <em>Kelsey, supra, </em>at 52. All the world is not party to a divorce proceeding. What is true is that all the world need not be present before a court granting the decree and yet it must be respected by the other forty-seven States provided — and it is a big proviso — the conditions for the exercise of power by the divorce-decreeing court are validly established whenever that judgment is elsewhere called into question. In short, the decree of divorce is a conclusive adjudication of everything except the jurisdictional facts upon which it is founded, and domicil is a jurisdictional fact. To permit the necessary finding of domicil by one State to foreclose all States in the protection of their social institutions would be intolerable.</p>
<p id="b290-5">But to endow each State with controlling authority to nullify the power of a sister State to grant a divorce based upon a finding that one spouse had acquired a new domicil within the divorcing State would, in the proper functioning of our federal system, be equally indefensible. No State court can assume comprehensive attention to the various and potentially conflicting interests that several States may have in the institutional aspects of marriage. The necessary accommodation between the right of one State to safeguard its interest in the family relation of its own people and the power of another State to grant divorces can be left to neither State.</p>
<p id="b290-6">The problem is to reconcile the reciprocal respect to be accorded by the members of the Union to their adjudica-’ <page-number citation-index="1" label="233">*233</page-number>tions with due regard for another most important aspect of our federalism whereby “the domestic relations of husband and wife . . . were matters reserved to the States,” <em>Popovici </em>v. <em>Agler, </em>280 U. S. 379, 383-84, and do not belong to the United States. <em>In re Burrus, </em>136 U. S. 586, 593-94. The rights that belong to all the States and the obligations which membership in the Union imposes upon all, are made effective because this Court is open to consider claims, such as this case presents, that the courts of one State have not given the full faith and credit to the judgment of a sister State that is required by Art. IV, § 1 of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="b291-3">But the discharge of this duty does not make of this Court a court of probate and divorce. Neither a rational system of law nor hard practicality calls for our independent determination, in reviewing the judgment of a State court, of that rather elusive relation between person and place which establishes domicil. “It is not for us to retry the facts,” as was held in a case in which, like the present, the jurisdiction underlying a sister-State judgment was dependent on domicil. <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Ernst, </em>232 U. S. 162, 164. The challenged judgment must, however, satisfy our scrutiny that the reciprocal duty of respect owed by the States to one another’s adjudications has been fairly discharged, and has not been evaded under the guise of finding an absence of domicil and therefore a want of power in the court rendering the judgment.</p>
<p id="b291-4">What is immediately before us is the judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina. We have authority to upset it only if there is want of foundation for the conclusion that that Court reached. The conclusion it reached turns on its finding that the spouses who obtained the Nevada decrees were not domiciled there. The fact that the Nevada court found that they were domiciled there is entitled to respect, and more. The burden of undermining the verity which the Nevada decrees import <page-number citation-index="1" label="234">*234</page-number>rests heavily upon the assailant. But simply because the Nevada court found that it had power to award a divorce decree cannot, we have seen, foreclose reexamination by another State. Otherwise, as was pointed out long ago, a court’s record would establish its power and the power would be proved by the record. Such circular reasoning would give one State a control over all the other States which the Full Faith and Credit Clause certainly did not confer. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Whitman, supra. </em>If this Court finds that proper weight was accorded to the claims of power by the court of one State in rendering a judgment the validity of which is pleaded in defense in another State, that the burden of overcoming such respect by disproof of the substratum of fact — here domicil — on which such power alone can rest was properly charged against the party challenging the legitimacy of the judgment, that such issue of fact was left for fair determination by appropriate procedure, and that a finding adverse to the necessary foundation for any valid sister-State judgment was amply supported in evidence, we cannot upset the judgment before us. And we cannot do so even if we also found in the record of the court of original judgment warrant for its finding that it had jurisdiction. If it is a matter turning on local law, great deference is owed by the courts of one State to what a court of another State has done. See <em>Michigan Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ferry, </em>228 U. S. 346. But when we are dealing as here with an historic notion common to all English-speaking courts, that of domicil, we should not find a want of deference to a sister State on the part of a court of another State which finds an absence of domicil where such a conclusion is warranted by the record.</p>
<p id="b292-5">When this case was first here, North Carolina did not challenge the finding of the Nevada court that petitioners had acquired domicils in Nevada. For her challenge of the Nevada decrees, North Carolina rested on <em>Haddock </em>v. <page-number citation-index="1" label="235">*235</page-number><em>Haddock, </em>201 U. S. 562. Upon retrial, however, the existence of domicil in Nevada became the decisive issue. The judgments of conviction now under review bring before us a record which may be fairly summarized by saying that the petitioners left North Carolina for the purpose of getting divorces from their respective spouses in Nevada and as soon as each had done so and married one another they left Nevada and returned to North Carolina to live there together as man and wife. Against the charge of bigamous cohabitation under § 14-183 of the North Carolina General Statutes, petitioners stood on their Nevada divorces and offered exemplified copies of the Nevada proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial judge charged that the State had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) each petitioner was lawfully married to one person; (2) thereafter each petitioner contracted a second marriage with another person outside North Carolina; (3) the spouses of petitioners were living at the time of this second marriage; (4) petitioners cohabited with one another in North Carolina after the second marriage. The burden, it was charged, then devolved upon petitioners “to satisfy the trial jury, not beyond a reasonable doubt nor by the greater weight of the evidence, but simply to satisfy” the jury from all the evidence, that petitioners were domiciled in Nevada at the time they obtained their divorces. The court further charged that “the recitation” of <em>bona fide </em>domicil in the Nevada decree <page-number citation-index="1" label="236">*236</page-number>was “prima facie evidence” sufficient to. warrant a finding of domicil in Nevada but not compelling “such an inference.” If the jury found, as they were told, that petitioners had domicils in North Carolina and went to Nevada “simply and solely for the purpose of obtaining” divorces, intending to return to North Carolina on obtaining them, they never lost their North Carolina domicils nor acquired new domicils in Nevada. Domicil, the jury was instructed, was that place where a person “has voluntarily fixed his abode . . . not for a mere special or temporary purpose, but with a present intention of making it his home, either permanently or for an indefinite or unlimited length of time.”</p>
<p id="b294-5">The scales of justice must not be unfairly weighted by a State when full faith and credit is claimed for a sister-State judgment. But North Carolina has not so dealt with the Nevada decrees. She has not raised unfair barriers to their recognition. North Carolina did not fail in appreciation or application of federal standards of full faith and credit. Appropriate weight was given to the finding of domicil in the Nevada decrees, and that finding was allowed to be overturned only by relevant standards of proof. There is nothing to suggest that the issue was not fairly submitted to the jury and that it was not fairly assessed on cogent evidence.</p>
<p id="b294-6">State courts cannot avoid review by this Court of their disposition of a constitutional claim by casting it in the form of an unreviewable finding of fact. <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>294 U. S. 587, 590. This record is barren of such attempted evasion. What it shows is that petitioners, long-time residents of North Carolina, came to Nevada, where they stayed in an auto-court for transients, filed suits for divorce as soon as the Nevada law permitted, married one another as soon as the divorces were obtained, and promptly returned to North Carolina to live. It cannot reasonably be claimed that one set of inferences rather <page-number citation-index="1" label="237">*237</page-number>than another regarding the acquisition by petitioners of new domicils in Nevada could not be drawn from the circumstances attending their Nevada divorces. It would be highly unreasonable to assert that a jury could not reasonably find that the evidence demonstrated that petitioners went to Nevada solely for the purpose of obtaining a divorce and intended all along to return to North Carolina. Such an intention, the trial court properly charged, would preclude acquisition of domicils in Nevada. See <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Osenton, </em>232 U. S. 619. And so we cannot say that North Carolina was not entitled to draw the inference that petitioners never abandoned their domicils in North Carolina, particularly since we could not conscientiously prefer, were it our business to do so, the contrary finding of the Nevada court.</p>
<p id="b295-4">If a State cannot foreclose, on review here, all the other States by its finding that one spouse is domiciled within its bounds, persons may, no doubt, place themselves in situations that create unhappy consequences for them. This is merely one of those untoward results inevitable in a federal system in which regulation of domestic relations has been left with the States and not given to the national authority. But the occasional disregard by any one State of the reciprocal obligations of the forty-eight States to respect the constitutional power of each to deal with domestic relations of those domiciled within its borders is hardly an argument for allowing one State to deprive the other forty-seven States of their constitutional rights. Relevant statistics happily do not justify lurid forebodings that parents without number will disregard the fate of their offspring by being unmindful of the status of dignity to which they are entitled. But, in any event, to the extent that some one State may, for considerations of its own, improperly intrude into domestic relations subject to the authority of the other States, it suffices to suggest that any such indifference by a State to the bond of the Union should be discouraged, not encouraged.</p>
<p id="b296-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="238">*238</page-number>In seeking a decree of divorce outside the State in which he has theretofore maintained his marriage, a person is necessarily involved in the legal situation created by our federal system whereby one State can grant a divorce of validity in other States only if the applicant has. a <em>bona fide </em>domicil in the State of the court purporting to dissolve a prior legal marriage. The petitioners therefore assumed the risk that this Court would find that North Carolina justifiably concluded that they had not been domiciled in Nevada. Since the divorces which they sought and received in Nevada had no legal validity in North Carolina and their North Carolina spouses were still alive, they subjected themselves to prosecution for bigamous cohabitation under North Carolina law. The legitimate finding of the North Carolina Supreme Court that the petitioners were not in truth domiciled in Nevada was not a contingency against which the petitioners were protected by anything in the Constitution of the United States. A man’s fate often depends, as for instance in the enforcement of the Sherman Law, on far greater risks that he will estimate “rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some matter of degree. If his judgment is wrong, not only may he incur a fine or a short imprisonment, as here; he may incur the penalty of death.” <em>Nash </em>v. <em>United States, </em>229 U. S. 373, 377. The objection that punishment of a person for an act as a crime when ignorant of the facts making it so, involves a denial of due process of law has more than once been overruled. In vindicating its public policy and particularly one so important as that bearing upon the integrity of family life, a State in punishing particular acts may provide that “he who shall do them shall do them at his peril and will not be heard to plead in defense good faith or ignorance.” <em>United States </em>v. <em>Balint, </em>258 U. S. 250, 252, quoting <em>Shevlin-Carpenter Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>218 U. S. 57, 69-70. Mistaken notions about one’s legal rights are not sufficient to bar prosecution for crime.</p>
<p id="b297-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="239">*239</page-number>We conclude that North Carolina was not required to yield her State policy because a Nevada court found that petitioners were domiciled in Nevada when it granted them decrees of divorce. North Carolina was entitled to find, as she did, that they did not acquire domicils in Nevada and that the Nevada court was therefore without power to liberate the petitioners from amenability to the laws of North Carolina governing domestic relations. And, as was said in connection with another aspect of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, our conclusion “is not a matter to arouse the susceptibilities of the States, all of which are equally concerned in the question and equally on both sides.” <em>Fauntleroy </em>v. <em>Lum, </em>210 U. S. 230, 238.</p>
<p id="b297-4">As for the suggestion that <em>Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina, supra, </em>foreclosed the Supreme Court of North Carolina from ordering a second trial upon the issue of domicil, it suffices to refer to our opinion in the earlier case.</p>
