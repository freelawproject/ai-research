 [11] We agree with the District Court that the appellants' contentions are substantial.  Indeed upon full consideration of the question we have decided that the "far-reaching implications" of Wirtz should be overruled, and that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed.  II It is established beyond peradventure that the Commerce Clause of Art. I of the Constitution is a grant of plenary authority to Congress.  That authority is, in the words of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), "the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed." Id., at 196.  When considering the validity of asserted applications of this power to wholly private activity, the Court has made it clear that "[e]ven activity that is purely intrastate in character may be regulated by Congress, where the activity, combined with like conduct by others similarly situated, affects commerce among the States or with foreign nations." Fry v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 542, 547</citedDecision> (1975).  Congressional power over areas of private endeavor, even when its exercise may pre-empt express state-law determinations contrary to the result which has commended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress, has been held to be limited only by the requirement that "the means chosen by [Congress] must be reasonably adapted to the end permitted by the Constitution." Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 262 (1964).  *841 Appellants in no way challenge these decisions establishing the breadth of authority granted Congress under the commerce power.  Their contention, on the contrary, is that when Congress seeks to regulate directly the activities of States as public employers, it transgresses an affirmative limitation on the exercise of its power akin to other commerce power affirmative limitations contained in the Constitution.  Congressional enactments which may be fully within the grant of legislative authority contained in the Commerce Clause may nonetheless be invalid because found to offend against the right to trial by jury contained in the Sixth Amendment, United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570 (1968), or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6 (1969).  Appellants' essential contention is that the 1974 amendments to the Act, while undoubtedly within the scope of the Commerce Clause, encounter a similar constitutional barrier because they are to be applied directly to the States and subdivisions of States as employers.

 .  .  `the utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity,' " which they feared.  392 U. S., at 196 .  Appellee Secretary in this case, both in his brief and upon oral argument, has agreed that our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.  See, e. g., Brief for Appellee 30-41; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-43.  In <citedDecision>Fry, supra,</citedDecision> the Court recognized that an express declaration of this limitation is found in the Tenth Amendment: "While the Tenth Amendment has been characterized as a `truism,' stating merely that `all is retained which has not been surrendered,' United States v. *843 Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 124 (1941), it is not without significance.  The Amendment expressly declares the constitutional policy that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system." <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 547</citedDecision> n. 7.  In New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), Mr. Chief Justice Stone, speaking for four Members of an eight-Member Court [13] in rejecting the proposition that Congress could impose taxes on the States so long as it did so in a nondiscriminatory manner, observed: "A State may, like a private individual, own real property and receive income.  But in view of our former decisions we could hardly say that a general non-discriminatory real estate tax (apportioned), or an income tax laid upon citizens and States alike could be constitutionally applied to the State's capitol, its State-house, its public school houses, public parks, or its revenues from taxes or school lands, even though all real property and all income of the citizen is taxed." Id., at 587-588 .  [14] *844 The expressions in these more recent cases trace back to earlier decisions of this Court recognizing the essential role of the States in our federal system of government.  Mr. Chief Justice Chase, perhaps because of the particular time at which he occupied that office, had occasion more than once to speak for the Court on this point.  In Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869), he declared that "[t]he Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States."

 For even if we accept appellee's assessments concerning the impact of the amendments, their application will nonetheless significantly alter or displace the States' abilities to structure employer-employee relationships in such areas as fire prevention, police protection, sanitation, public health, and parks and recreation.  These activities are typical of those performed by state and local governments in discharging their dual functions of administering the public law and furnishing public services.  [16] Indeed, it is functions such as these which governments are created to provide, services such as these which the States have traditionally afforded their citizens.  If Congress may withdraw from the States the authority to make those fundamental employment decisions upon which their systems for performance of these functions must rest, we think there would be little left of the States' " `separate and independent existence.' " Coyle, 221 U. S., at 580 .  Thus, even if appellants may have overestimated the effect which the Act will have upon *852 their current levels and patterns of governmental activity, the dispositive factor is that Congress has attempted to exercise its Commerce Clause authority to prescribe minimum wages and maximum hours to be paid by the States in their capacities as sovereign governments.  In so doing, Congress has sought to wield its power in a fashion that would impair the States' "ability to function effectively in a federal system," Fry, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 547</citedDecision> n. 7.  This exercise of congressional authority does not comport with the federal system of government embodied in the Constitution.  We hold that insofar as the challenged amendments operate to directly displace the States' freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions, they are not within the authority granted Congress by Art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  [17] III One final matter requires our attention.  Appellee has vigorously urged that we cannot, consistently with the Court's decisions in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968), and <citedDecision>Fry, supra,</citedDecision> rule against him here.  It is important to examine this contention so that it will be clear what we hold today, and what we do not.  With regard to <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> , we disagree with appellee.  There the Court held that the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 was constitutional as applied to temporarily freeze the wages of state and local government employees.  The Court expressly noted that the degree of intrusion upon the protected area of state sovereignty was in that case *853 even less than that worked by the amendments to the FLSA which were before the Court in Wirtz .  The Court recognized that the Economic Stabilization Act was "an emergency measure to counter severe inflation that threatened the national economy." <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 548</citedDecision> .  We think our holding today quite consistent with <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> .  The enactment at issue there was occasioned by an extremely serious problem which endangered the well-being of all the component parts of our federal system and which only collective action by the National Government might forestall.  The means selected were carefully drafted so as not to interfere with the States' freedom beyond a very limited, specific period of time.  The effect of the across-the-board freeze authorized by that Act, moreover, displaced no state choices as to how governmental operations should be structured, nor did it force the States to remake such choices themselves.  Instead, it merely required that the wage scales and employment relationships which the States themselves had chosen be maintained during the period of the emergency.  Finally, the Economic Stabilization Act operated to reduce the pressures upon state budgets rather than increase them.  These factors distinguish the statute in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> from the provisions at issue here.  The limits imposed upon the commerce power when Congress seeks to apply it to the States are not so inflexible as to preclude temporary enactments tailored to combat a national emergency.  "[A]lthough an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived, nevertheless emergency may afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed." Wilson v. New, 243 U. S. 332, 348 (1917).  With respect to the Court's decision in Wirtz , we reach a different conclusion.  Both appellee and the District Court thought that decision required rejection of appellants' *854 claims.  Appellants, in turn, advance several arguments by which they seek to distinguish the facts before the Court in Wirtz from those presented by the 1974 amendments to the Act.

 The 1974 amendments are, however, an entirely legitimate exercise of the commerce power, not in the slightest restrained by any doctrine of state sovereignty cognizable in this Court, as Case v. Bowles , United States v. California , Maryland v. Wirtz , and our other pertinent precedents squarely and definitively establish.  Moreover, since Maryland v. Wirtz is overruled, the Fair Labor Standards Act is invalidated in its application to all state employees "in [any areas] that the States have regarded as integral parts of their governmental activities." Ante, at 854 n. 18.  This standard is a meaningless limitation on the Court's state-sovereignty doctrine, and thus today's holding goes beyond even what the States of Washington and California urged in Case v. Bowles and United States v. California , and by its logic would overrule those cases and with them Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and certain reasoning in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S. 279, 284-285 (1973).  I cannot recall another instance in the Court's history when the reasoning of so many decisions covering so long a span of time has been *872 discarded in such a roughshod manner.  That this is done without any justification not already often advanced and consistently rejected, clearly renders today's decision an ipse dixit reflecting nothing but displeasure with a congressional judgment.  My Brethren's treatment of Fry v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 542</citedDecision> (1975), further illustrates the paucity of legal reasoning or principle justifying today's result.  Although the Economic Stabilization Act "displace[d] the States' freedom," ante, at 852the reason given for invalidating the 1974 amendmentsthe result in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> is not disturbed since the interference was temporary and only a national program enforced by the Federal Government could have alleviated the country's economic crisis.  Thus, although my Brethren by fiat strike down the 1974 amendments without analysis of countervailing national considerations, <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> by contrary logic remains undisturbed because, on balance, countervailing national considerations override the interference with the State's freedom.  Moreover, it is sophistry to say the Economic Stabilization Act "displaced no state choices," ante, at 853, but that the 1974 amendments do, ante, at 848.  Obviously the Stabilization Actno less than every exercise of a national power delegated to Congress by the Constitution displaced the State's freedom.  It is absurd to suggest that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between curbs against increasing wages and curbs against paying wages lower than the federal minimum.  Today's holding patently is in derogation of the sovereign power of the Nation to regulate interstate commerce.  Can the States engage in businesses competing with the private sector and then come to the courts arguing that withdrawing the employees of those businesses from the private sector evades the power of the Federal Government to regulate commerce?  See New York v. *873 United States, 326 U. S., at 582 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  No principle given meaningful content by my Brethren today precludes the States from doing just that.  Our historic decisions rejecting all suggestions that the States stand in a different position from affected private parties when challenging congressional exercise of the commerce power reflect that very concern.  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936).  <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> only last Term emphasized "that States are not immune from all federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status.  " <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 548</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  For "[b]y empowering Congress to regulate commerce.  .  .  the States necessarily surrendered any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regulation." Parden v. Terminal R. Co., supra, at 192; see Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., supra, at 286.  Employment relations of States that subject themselves to congressional regulation by participating in regulable commerce are subject to congressional regulation.

 Office of Management and Budget, Special Analyses: Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1977, p. 255.  Appellants complain of the impact of the amended FLSA on police and fire departments, but the 1977 budget contemplates outlays for law enforcement assistance of $716 million.  Id., at 258.  Concern is also expressed about the diminished ability to hire students in the summer if States must pay them a minimum wage, but the Federal Government's "summer youth program" provides $400 million for 670,000 jobs.  Ibid. Given this demonstrated ability to obtain funds from the Federal Government for needed state services, there is little doubt that the States' influence in the political process is adequate to safeguard their sovereignty.  [14] *879 My Brethren's disregard for precedents recognizing these long-settled constitutional principles is painfully obvious in their cavalier treatment of Maryland v. Wirtz .  Without even a passing reference to the doctrine of stare decisis, Wirtz regarded as controlling only last Term, <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 548</citedDecision> , and as good law in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S., at 283is by exercise of raw judicial power overruled.  No effort is made to distinguish the FLSA amendments sustained in Wirtz from the 1974 amendments.  We are told at the outset that "the `far-reaching implications' of Wirtz should be overruled," ante, at 840; later it is said that the "reasoning in Wirtz " is no longer "authoritative," ante, at 854.  My Brethren then merely restate their essential-function test and say that Wirtz must "therefore" be overruled.  Ante, at 855-856.  There is no analysis whether Wirtz reached the correct result, apart from any flaws in reasoning, even though we are told that "there are obvious differences" between this case and Wirtz.  Ante, at 855.

 This statement is at the end of a paragraph in Wirtz recognizing that Congress' commerce power is limited because it reaches only " `commerce with foreign nations and among the several States.' " 392 U. S., at 196 , quoting Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S., at 466 .  The passage that follows the language quoted by the Court is: "But while the commerce power has limits, valid general regulations of commerce do not cease to be regulations of commerce because a State is involved.  If a State is engaging in economic activities that are validly regulated by the Federal Government when engaged in by private persons, the State too may be forced to conform its activities to federal regulation." 392 U. S., at 196-197 .  It is clear, then, that this Court's "ample power" to prevent the destruction of the States was not found in Wirtz to result from some affirmative limit on the exercise of the commerce power, but rather in the Court's function of limiting congressional exercise of its power to regulation of "commerce." [4]  The Court relies on Fry v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 542</citedDecision> , 547 n. 7 (1975), but I cannot subscribe to reading <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> as departing, without analysis, from a principle that has remained unquestioned for over 150 years.  Although the Tenth Amendment "is not without significance," ibid., its meaning is clear: it declares that our Federal Government is one of delegated powers.  And it is because of this constraint, rather than the state-sovereignty doctrine discovered today by the Court, "that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Fry did not say that there is a limit in the Tenth Amendment on the exercise of a delegated power, but instead said that "Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that .  .  .  ." The only import of the footnote in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> , then, is that Congress may not invade state sovereignty by exercising powers not delegated to it by the Constitution; since the wage ceilings at issue in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> were clearly within the commerce power, we found no "drastic invasion of state sovereignty." <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 548 n. 7.  Even the author of today's opinion stated in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> that the Tenth Amendment does not "by its terms" restrict Congress' power to regulate commerce.  <citedDecision>Id., at 557</citedDecision> (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting).  [5]  In support of the first-quoted paragraph, Darby cited 2 J. Elliot, Debates 123, 131 (2d ed. 1787); 3 id., at 450, 464, 600; 4 id., at 140, 148; 1 Annals of Congress 432, 761, 767-768 (1789); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution §§ 1907-1908 (2d ed. 1851) ("It is plain, therefore, that it could not have been the intention of the framers of this amendment to give it effect, as an abridgment of any of the powers granted under the constitution, whether they are express or implied, direct or incidental.  Its sole design is to exclude any interpretation, by which other powers should be assumed beyond those which are granted").  Decisions expressly rejecting today's interpretation of the Tenth Amendment also include Sperry v. Florida ex rel. Florida Bar, 373 U. S. 379, 403 (1963); Oklahoma v. CSC, 330 U. S. 127, 143 (1947); Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92, 102 (1946); Fernandez v. Wiener, 326 U. S. 340 , 362 (1945); Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Atkinson Co., 313 U. S. 508, 534 (1941); United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 733-734 (1931).  [6] Case also expressed concerns about creating a state-sovereignty limitation on a delegated power that are equally applicable to restrictions on the commerce power: "The result would be that the constitutional grant of the power to make war would be inadequate to accomplish its full purpose.  And this result would impair a prime purpose of the Federal Government's establishment." 327 U. S., at 102.

 But when Congress moderated its position and passed the bill in another form, the President signed it and noted the compromise: "S. 2747 also extends coverage to include Federal, State, and local government employees, domestic workers, and others previously excluded from coverage.  The Congress has reduced some of the economic and social disruptions this extension could cause by recognizing the unique requirements of police, fire, and correctional services." 10 Weekly Comp. of Presidential Documents 392 (1974).  [14]  In contrast, my Brethren frequently remand powerless individuals to the political process by invoking doctrines of standing, justiciability, and remedies.  For example, in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490 (1975), the Court suggested that some residents of Rochester, N. Y., "not overlook the availability of the normal democratic process," id., at 508 n. 18, even though they were challenging a suburban zoning ordinance and had no voice in the suburb's political affairs.  In this case, however, those entities with perhaps the greatest representation in the political process have lost a legislative battle, but when they enter the courts and repeat the arguments made in the political branches, the Court welcomes them with open arms, embraces their political cause, and overrides Congress' political decision.  [15]  In contrast, the Court measures the legislation at issue in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> in light of today's decision, although, as I have noted, that consideration amounts to a repudiation of the Court's holding.  See supra, at 872.  Just as the reasoning of Wirtz is rejected, however, the reasoning of <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> , decided only last Term, must also be deemed rejected, for it adhered totally to the principles of Wirtz .  That the Economic Stabilization Act was an emergency measure was not dispositive in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> ; it merely rendered the Act "even less intrusive" than the "quite limited" legislation sustained in Wirtz.  <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 548</citedDecision> .
