**Combined Opinion**
 Because of alleged negligence of the master and officers in furnishing proper treatment, he suffered permanent injury from the disease.  McAllister sued the petitioner, Cosmopolitan, under the Jones Act.  The complaint alleged that Cosmopolitan “managed, operated and controlled” The Haines under a General Agency Agreement with its owner, that McAllister was in the employ of Cosmopolitan, and that his injuries resulted from the negligence of Cosmopolitan, “its agents, servants, and employees” in failing to take precautions against a known poliomyelitis epidemic and in failing to provide proper treatment.  The answer denied these allegations.  The jury found a verdict for respondent for $100,000.  On appeal the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.  McAllister v. Cosmopolitan Shipping Co., <citedDecision>169 F. 2d 4</citedDecision> .  While recognizing, that Cosmopolitan was “a shipping company which contracted with the.  War Shipping Administration to attend to the accounting' ^nd certain other shoreside .  usiness of The Haines- ... in accordance with the standard form of General- Agency Service Agreement,” id. at p. 5, the court felt itself bound by the decision of this Court in Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines, supra. It relied upon the fact that we expressly distinguished the Hust *787 ease in Caldarola v. Eckert, supra. The Court of Appeals reached this conclusion despite the fact that the injury to Hust occurred prior to the' Clarification Act, and the injury here occurred subsequent to that act.  In its view the Hust case held, as a matter of law, that before the Clarification Act a seaman under the Jones Act could recover for a tort against a service agreement general agent, as an employer.  The court did not perceive how the Clarification Act changed this liability.  169 F.. 2d 4,8.
