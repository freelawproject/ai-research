 The District Court, in paragraph 5 of its judgment, also ordered the state officials to "release and remit AABD benefits wrongfully withheld to all applicants for AABD in the State of Illinois who applied between July 1, 1968 [the date of the federal regulations] and April 16, 197[1] [the date of the preliminary injunction issued by the District Court] and were determined eligible .  .  .  ." [5] *657 On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the Illinois officials contended, inter alia, that the Eleventh Amendment barred the award of *658 retroactive benefits, that the judgment of inconsistency between the federal regulations and the provisions of the Illinois Categorical Assistance Manual could be given prospective effect only, and that the federal regulations in question were inconsistent with the Social Security Act itself.  The Court of Appeals rejected these contentions and affirmed the judgment of the District Court. Jordan v. Weaver, 472 F. 2d 985 (1973).  [6] Because of an apparent conflict on the Eleventh Amendment issue with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Rothstein v. Wyman, <citedDecision>467 F. 2d 226</citedDecision> (1972), cert. denied, 411 U. S. 921 (1973), we granted the petition for certiorari filed by petitioner Joel Edelman, who is the present Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid, and successor to the former directors sued below.  412 U. S. 937 (1973).  The petition for certiorari raised the same contentions urged by the petitioner in the Court of Appeals.  [7] Because we believe the Court of Appeals *659 erred in its disposition of the Eleventh Amendment claim, we reverse that portion of the Court of Appeals decision which affirmed the District Court's order that retroactive benefits be paid by the Illinois state officials.  [8] *660 The historical basis of the Eleventh Amendment has been oft stated, and it represents one of the more dramatic examples of this Court's effort to derive meaning from the document given to the Nation by the Framers nearly 200 years ago.  A leading historian of the Court tells us: "The right of the Federal Judiciary to summon a State as defendant and to adjudicate its rights and liabilities had been the subject of deep apprehension and of active debate at the time of the adoption of the Constitution; but the existence of any such right had been disclaimed by many of the most eminent advocates of the new Federal Government, and it was largely owing to their successful dissipation of the fear of the existence of such Federal power that the Constitution was finally adopted." 1 C. Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History 91 (rev. ed. 1937).

 .  .  .  "It is one thing to tell the Commissioner of Social Services that he must comply with the federal standards for the future if the state is to have the benefit of federal funds in the programs he administers.  It is quite another thing to order the Commissioner to use state funds to make reparation for the past.  The latter would appear to us to fall afoul of the Eleventh Amendment if that basic constitutional provision is to be conceived of as having any present force." <citedDecision>467 F. 2d, at 236-237</citedDecision> (footnotes omitted).  We agree with Judge McGowan's observations.  The funds to satisfy the award in this case must inevitably come from the general revenues of the State of Illinois, and thus the award resembles far more closely the monetary award against the State itself, Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, supra , than it does the prospective injunctive relief awarded in Ex parte Young.  The Court of Appeals, in upholding the award in this case, held that it was permissible because it was in the form of "equitable restitution" instead of damages, and therefore capable of being tailored in such a way as to minimize disruptions of the state program of categorical assistance.  But we must judge the award actually made in this case, and not one which might have been differently tailored in a different case, and we must judge *666 it in the context of the important constitutional principle embodied in the Eleventh Amendment.  [11] We do not read Ex parte Young or subsequent holdings of this Court to indicate that any form of relief may be awarded against a state officer, no matter how closely it may in practice resemble a money judgment payable out of the state treasury, so long as the relief may be labeled "equitable" in nature.  The Court's opinion in Ex parte Young hewed to no such line. Its citation of Hagood v. Southern, 117 U. S. 52 (1886), and In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443 (1887), which were both actions *667 against state officers for specific performance of a contract to which the State was a party, demonstrate that equitable relief may be barred by the Eleventh Amendment.

 In State Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Services v. Zarate, 407 U. S. 918 , the sole issue presented to us [4] was whether the Eleventh Amendment barred a judgment against state officers for retroactive welfare assistance benefits or payments.  That had been ordered by the lower court and we summarily affirmed, only MR. JUSTICE WHITE voting to note probable jurisdiction.  We also summarily affirmed the judgment in Sterrett v. Mothers' & Children's Rights Organization, 409 U. S. 809 , where one of the two questions [5] was whether retroactive payments of benefits violated the Eleventh Amendment.  In Wyman v. Bowens, 397 U. S. 49 , we affirmed a judgment *683 where payments were awarded in spite of the argument that the order was an incursion on the Eleventh Amendment.  [6] In Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 , we affirmed a judgment which ordered payment of benefits wrongfully withheld; [7] and while we did not specifically refer to the point, the lower court had expressly rejected the Eleventh Amendment argument.  [8] In Gaither v. Sterrett, 346 F. Supp. 1095, 1099 , whose judgment we affirmed, [9] 409 U. S. 1070 , the court said: "[T]his court would note that if defendants' position regarding the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment is correct, a great number of federal district court judgments are void, and the Supreme Court has affirmed many of these void judgments." The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is in line with that view; the opposed view of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Rothstein v. Wyman, <citedDecision>467 F. 2d 226</citedDecision> , is out of harmony with the established law. What is asked by the instant case is minor compared to the relief granted in Griffin v. School Board, 377 U. S. 218 .  In that case we authorized entry of an order putting an end to a segregated school system.  We held, inter alia, that "the District Court may, if necessary to prevent further racial discrimination, require the Supervisors to *684 exercise the power that is theirs to levy taxes to raise funds adequate to reopen, operate, and maintain without racial discrimination a public school system in Prince Edward County like that operated in other counties in Virginia." Id., at 233 .  We so held against vigorous contentions of the state officials that the Eleventh Amendment protected the State; and in reply we cited Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529 , and Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm'n, 327 U. S. 573, 579 , to support the proposition that "actions against a county can be maintained in United States courts in order to vindicate federally guaranteed rights." 377 U. S., at 233.  Griffin is sought to be distinguished on the ground that a "county" is not the "state" for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.

 [10]  Of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, sitting by designation on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  [11]  It may be true, as stated by our Brother DOUGLAS in dissent, that "[m]ost welfare decisions by federal courts have a financial impact on the States." Post, at 680-681.  But we cannot agree that such a financial impact is the same where a federal court applies Ex parte Young to grant prospective declaratory and injunctive relief, as opposed to an order of retroactive payments as was made in the instant case. It is not necessarily true that "[w]hether the decree is prospective only or requires payments for the weeks or months wrongfully skipped over by the state officials, the nature of the impact on the state treasury is precisely the same." Post, at 682.  This argument neglects the fact that where the State has a definable allocation to be used in the payment of public aid benefits, and pursues a certain course of action such as the processing of applications within certain time periods as did Illinois here, the subsequent ordering by a federal court of retroactive payments to correct delays in such processing will invariably mean there is less money available for payments for the continuing obligations of the public aid system.  As stated by Judge McGowan in Rothstein v. Wyman, <citedDecision>467 F. 2d 226, 235</citedDecision> (CA2 1972): "The second federal policy which might arguably be furthered by retroactive payments is the fundamental goal of congressional welfare legislationÂ—the satisfaction of the ascertained needs of impoverished persons.  Federal standards are designed to ensure that those needs are equitably met; and there may perhaps be cases in which the prompt payment of funds wrongfully withheld will serve that end.  As time goes by, however, retroactive payments become compensatory rather than remedial; the coincidence between previously ascertained and existing needs becomes less clear." [12]  The Court of Appeals considered the Court's decision in Griffin v. School Board, 377 U. S. 218 (1964), to be of like import.  But as may be seen from Griffin 's citation of Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529 (1890), a county does not occupy the same position as a State for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.  See also Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973).  The fact that the county policies executed by the county officials in Griffin were subject to the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment, but the county was not able to invoke the protection of the Eleventh Amendment, is no more than a recognition of the long-established rule that while county action is generally state action for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, a county defendant is not necessarily a state defendant for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.
