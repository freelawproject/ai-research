**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 For there we said: “The ‘claim of right’ interpretation of the tax laws has long been used to give finality to [the accounting] period, and is now deeply rooted in the federal tax system.  .  .  .  We see no reason why the Court should depart from this well-settled interpretation merely because it results in an advantage or disadvantage to a taxpayer.” 340 U. S., at 592 .  The same principle was reiterated and applied in Healy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 .  The supposed conflict between Wilcox and Rutkin, upon which The Chief Justice’s opinion seeks to justify its repudiation of Wilcox, 7 has been adequately treated in *258 the opinion of Mr. Justice Black, and I agree with him that those cases were fully intended to be, and are, reconcilable, both on their controlling facts and applicable law. If the unnecessarily broad language used in the Rutkin opinion has misled any of the lower federal courts in their understanding of the principles underlying Wilcox , we should clarify their understanding at this time, and continue our adherence to “a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” Helvering v. Hallock, <citedDecision>309 U. S. 106, 119</citedDecision> .  “A proper regard for its genesis, as well as its very clear language, requires also that [the Sixteenth] Amendment shall not be extended by loose construction .... Congress cannot by any definition [of income] it may adopt conclude the matter, since it cannot by legislation alter the Constitution, from which alone it derives its power to legislate, and within whose limitations alone that power can be lawfully exercised.” Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 206 .  See, e. g., Spear Box Co. v. Commissioner, 182 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Helvering v. Jane Holding Corp., 109 F. 2d 933 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Pacific Magnesium, Inc., v. Westover, 86 F. Supp. 644 (D. C. S. D. Cal.).  See, e. g., Schweppe v. Commissioner, 168 F. 2d 284 (C. A. 9th Cir.); North American Coal Corp. v. Commissioner, 97 F. 2d 325 (C. A. 6th Cir.); Securities Co. v. United States, 85 F. Supp. 532 (D. C. S. D. N.Y.).  26 U. S. C. §§ 6321-6323 , 6331; Bankruptcy Act, § 64 (a), 11 U. S. C. § 104 (a).  Moreover, R. S. §3466 (1876), now codified in 31 U. S. C. § 191 , pertaining to state insolvency proceedings against debtors, commands that “the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.” We long ago established that the term “debts” in this statute' includes delinquent federal taxes.  Price v. United States, 269 U. S. 492, 499-500 .
