 Chapter 2 had such effect, in his view, because the materials and equipment loaned to the Catholic schools were direct aid to those schools and because the Catholic schools were, he concluded after detailed inquiry into their doctrine and curriculum, "pervasively sectarian." App. to Pet. for Cert. 151a.  Chief Judge Heebe relied primarily on Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229 (1977), in which we held unconstitutional programs that provided many of the same sorts of materials and equipment as does Chapter 2.  In 1994, after having resolved the numerous other issues in the case, he issued an order permanently excluding pervasively sectarian schools in Jefferson Parish from receiving any Chapter 2 materials or equipment.  Two years later, Chief Judge Heebe having retired, Judge Livaudais received the case. Ruling in early 1997 on postjudgment motions, he reversed the decision of former Chief Judge Heebe and upheld Chapter 2, pointing to several significant changes in the legal landscape over the previous seven years.  Helms v. Cody, 1997 WL 35283 (Jan. 28), App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a.  In particular, Judge Livaudais cited our 1993 decision in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., <citedDecision>509 U. S. 1</citedDecision> , in which we held that a State could, as part *805 of a federal program for the disabled, provide a signlanguage interpreter to a deaf student at a Catholic high school.  Judge Livaudais also relied heavily on a 1995 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Walker v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 46 F. 3d 1449 , upholding Chapter 2 on facts that he found "virtually indistinguishable." The Ninth Circuit acknowledged in Walker , as Judge Heebe had in his 1990 summary judgment ruling, that Meek and Wolman appeared to erect a constitutional distinction between providing textbooks (permissible) and providing any other in-kind aid (impermissible).  46 F. 3d, at 1464 1465; see Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968) (upholding textbook program).  The Court of Appeals viewed this distinction, however, as "thin" and "unmoored from any Establishment Clause principles," and, more importantly, as "rendered untenable" by subsequent cases, particularly <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> .  46 F. 3d, at 1465-1466.  These cases, in the Ninth Circuit's view, revived the principle of Allen and of Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , [3] that "state benefits provided to all citizens without regard to religion are constitutional." 46 F. 3d, at 1465.  The Ninth Circuit also relied, id., at 1467, on our observation in Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687 (1994), that "we have frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of any benefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges," id., at 704 .  The Ninth Circuit purported to distinguish Meek and Wolman based on the percentage of schools receiving aid that were parochial (a large percentage in those cases and a moderate percentage in Walker ), 46 F. 3d, at 1468, but that court undermined this distinction when it observed that Meek also upheld "the massive provision of textbooks *806 to parochial schools." 46 F. 3d, at 1468, n. 16.  Thus, although the Ninth Circuit did not explicitly hold that Meek and Wolman were no longer good law, its reasoning seemed to require that conclusion.  Finally, in addition to relying on our decision in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> and the Ninth Circuit's decision in Walker , Judge Livaudais invoked Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995), in which, a few months after Walker , we held that the Establishment Clause does not require a public university to exclude a student-run religious publication from assistance available to numerous other student-run publications.  Following Judge Livaudais' ruling, respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  While that appeal was pending, we decided Agostini , in which we approved a program that, under Title I of the ESEA, provided public employees to teach remedial classes at private schools, including religious schools.  In so holding, we overruled Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), and partially overruled School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985), both of which had involved such a program.  The Fifth Circuit thus faced a dilemma between, on the one hand, the Ninth Circuit's holding and analysis in Walker and our subsequent decisions in Rosenberger and Agostini , and, on the other hand, our holdings in Meek and Wolman .  To resolve the dilemma, the Fifth Circuit abandoned any effort to find coherence in our case law or to divine the future course of our decisions and instead focused on our particular holdings.  Helms v. Picard, 151 F. 3d 347, 371 (1998).
**Combined Opinion**
 In this case, our inquiry under Agostini 's purpose and effect test is a narrow one.  Because respondents do not challenge the District Court's holding that Chapter 2 has a secular purpose, and because the Fifth Circuit also did not question that holding, cf. 151 F. 3d, at 369, n. 17 , we will consider only Chapter 2's effect.  Further, in determining that effect, we will consider only the first two Agostini criteria, since neither respondents nor the Fifth Circuit has questioned the District Court's holding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a, that Chapter 2 does not create an excessive entanglement.  Considering Chapter 2 in light of our more recent case law, we conclude that it neither results in religious indoctrination by the government nor defines its recipients by reference to religion.  We therefore hold that Chapter 2 is not a "law respecting an establishment of religion." In so holding, we acknowledge what both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits saw was inescapable Meek and Wolman are anomalies in our case law. We therefore conclude that they are no longer good law. *809 A As we indicated in Agostini , and have indicated elsewhere, the question whether governmental aid to religious schools results in governmental indoctrination is ultimately a question whether any religious indoctrination that occurs in those schools could reasonably be attributed to governmental action.  See Agostini, supra, at 226 (presence of signlanguage interpreter in Catholic school "`cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking'" (quoting Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> ) (emphasis added in Agostini )); 521 U. S., at 230 (question is whether "any use of [governmental] aid to indoctrinate religion could be attributed to the State"); see also Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 841-842 ; Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 488-489 (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397 (1983); cf. Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 337 (1987) ("For a law to have forbidden `effects' under Lemon , it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through its own activities and influence").  We have also indicated that the answer to the question of indoctrination will resolve the question whether a program of educational aid "subsidizes" religion, as our religion cases use that term. See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 230-231 ; see also id., at 230 .  In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, we have consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion.  If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government.  For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question.  If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any particular *810 indoctrination.  To put the point differently, if the government, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without regard to religion, to all who adequately further that purpose, see Allen, 392 U. S., at 245-247 (discussing dual secular and religious purposes of religious schools), then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose.
**Combined Opinion**
 As a way of assuring neutrality, we have repeatedly considered whether any governmental aid that goes to a religious institution does so "only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of individuals." Agostini, supra, at 226 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We have viewed as significant whether the "private choices of individual parents," as opposed to the "unmediated" will of government, Ball, 473 U. S., at 395, n. 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), determine what schools ultimately benefit from the governmental aid, and how much.  For if numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.  Private choice also helps guarantee neutrality by mitigating the preference for pre-existing recipients that is arguably inherent in any governmental aid program, see, e. g., Gilder, The Revitalization of Everything: The Law of the Microcosm, Harv. Bus. Rev. 49 (Mar./Apr.  1988), and that could lead to a program inadvertently favoring one religion or favoring religious private schools in general over nonreligious ones.  The principles of neutrality and private choice, and their relationship to each other, were prominent not only in Agos- *811 tini, supra, at 225-226, 228, 230-232 , but also in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , Witters , and Mueller .  [5] The heart of our reasoning in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , upholding governmental provision of a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at his Catholic high school, was as follows: "The service at issue in this case is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as `disabled' under the [statute], without regard to the `sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature' of the school the child attends.  By according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a governmentpaid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents.  In other words, because the [statute] creates no financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school, an interpreter's presence there cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking." <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> .  As this passage indicates, the private choices helped to ensure neutrality, and neutrality and private choices together eliminated any possible attribution to the government even when the interpreter translated classes on Catholic doctrine.  Witters and Mueller employed similar reasoning.  In Witters , we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from including within a neutral program providing tuition payments for vocational rehabilitation a blind person studying at a Christian college to become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.  We explained: "Any aid .  .  .that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.
**Combined Opinion**
521 U. S., at 234 .  As we briefly explained in Agostini, id., at 230-231 , this second criterion looks to the same set of facts as does our focus, under the first criterion, on neutrality, see id., at 225-226 , but the second criterion uses those facts to answer a somewhat different questionwhether the criteria for allocating the aid "creat[e] a financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination," id. , at 231.  In Agostini we set out the following rule for answering this question: "This incentive is not present, however, where the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Under such circumstances, the aid is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion." Ibid. *814 The cases on which Agostini relied for this rule, and Agostini itself, make clear the close relationship between this rule, incentives, and private choice.  For to say that a program does not create an incentive to choose religious schools is to say that the private choice is truly "independent," Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 .  See Agostini, supra, at 232 (holding that Title I did not create any impermissible incentive, because its services were "available to all children who meet the Act's eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school"); Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> (discussing, in successive sentences, neutrality, private choice, and financial incentives, respectively); Witters, supra, at 488 (similar).  When such an incentive does exist, there is a greater risk that one could attribute to the government any indoctrination by the religious schools.  See <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 10</citedDecision> .  We hasten to add, what should be obvious from the rule itself, that simply because an aid program offers private schools, and thus religious schools, a benefit that they did not previously receive does not mean that the program, by reducing the cost of securing a religious education, creates, under Agostini `s second criterion, an "incentive" for parents to choose such an education for their children.  For any aid will have some such effect.  See Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 ; Everson, 330 U. S., at 17 ; see also Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 .  B Respondents inexplicably make no effort to address Chapter 2 under the Agostini test.  Instead, dismissing Agostini as factually distinguishable, they offer two rules that they contend should govern our determination of whether Chapter 2 has the effect of advancing religion.  They argue first, and chiefly, that "direct, nonincidental" aid to the primary educational mission of religious schools is always impermissible.  Second, they argue that provision to religious schools of aid that is divertible to religious use is similarly impermissible.  [7] *815 Respondents' arguments are inconsistent with our more recent case law, in particular Agostini and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , and we therefore reject them.  1 Although some of our earlier cases, particularly Ball, 473 U. S., at 393-394 , did emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect aid, the purpose of this distinction was *816 merely to prevent "subsidization" of religion, see id., at 394 .  As even the dissent all but admits, see post, at 889 (opinion of Souter, J.), our more recent cases address this purpose not through the direct/indirect distinction but rather through the principle of private choice, as incorporated in the first Agostini criterion ( i.  e., whether any indoctrination could be attributed to the government).  If aid to schools, even "direct aid," is neutrally available and, before reaching or benefiting any religious school, first passes through the hands (literally or figuratively) of numerous private citizens who are free to direct the aid elsewhere, the government has not provided any "support of religion," Witters, supra, at 489 .  See supra, at 810.  Although the presence of private choice is easier to see when aid literally passes through the hands of individualswhich is why we have mentioned directness in the same breath with private choice, see, e. g., Agostini, 521 U. S., at 226 ; Witters, supra, at 487 ; Mueller, supra, at 399there is no reason why the Establishment Clause requires such a form.
**Combined Opinion**
 It was undeniable in Witters that the aid (tuition) would ultimately go to the Inland Empire School of the Bible and would support religious education.  We viewed this arrangement, however, as no different from a government issuing a paycheck to one of its employees knowing that the employee would direct the funds to a religious institution.  Both arrangements would be valid, for the same reason: "[A]ny money that ultimately went to religious institutions did so `only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of' individuals." *817 Agostini, supra, at 226 (quoting Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 ).  In addition, the program in Witters was neutral.  521 U. S., at 225 (quoting Witters, supra, at 487 ).  As Agostini explained, the same reasoning was at work in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , where we allowed the government-funded interpreter to provide assistance at a Catholic school, "even though she would be a mouthpiece for religious instruction," because the interpreter was provided according to neutral eligibility criteria and private choice.  521 U. S., at 226 .  Therefore, the religious messages interpreted by the interpreter could not be attributed to the government, see ibid. (We saw no difference in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> between the government hiring the interpreter directly and the government providing funds to the parents who then would hire the interpreter.  <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 13, n. 11</citedDecision> .) We rejected the dissent's objection that we had never before allowed "a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination." See <citedDecision>id., at 18</citedDecision> (opinion of Blackmun, J.).  Finally, in Agostini itself, we used the reasoning of Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> to conclude that remedial classes provided under Title I of the ESEA by public employees did not impermissibly finance religious indoctrination.  521 U. S., at 228 ; see id., at 230-232 .  We found it insignificant that students did not have to directly apply for Title I services, that Title I instruction was provided to students in groups rather than individually, and that instruction was provided in the facilities of the private schools.  Id., at 226-229 .  To the extent that respondents intend their direct/indirect distinction to require that any aid be literally placed in the hands of schoolchildren rather than given directly to the school for teaching those same children, the very cases on which respondents most rely, Meek and Wolman , demonstrate the irrelevance of such formalism.  In Meek , we justified our rejection of a program that loaned instructional materials and equipment by, among other things, pointing out that the aid was loaned to the schools, and thus was "direct *818 aid." 421 U. S., at 362-363 .
**Combined Opinion**
 See 515 U. S., at 842 (collecting cases); id., at 846-847 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608-609 (1988); compare Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), with Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472 (1973).  [8] But *820 direct payments of money are not at issue in this case, and we refuse to allow a "special" case to create a rule for all cases. 2 Respondents also contend that the Establishment Clause requires that aid to religious schools not be impermissibly religious in nature or be divertible to religious use.  We agree with the first part of this argument but not the second.  Respondents' "no divertibility" rule is inconsistent with our more recent case law and is unworkable.  So long as the governmental aid is not itself "unsuitable for use in the public schools because of religious content," Allen, supra, at 245, and eligibility for aid is determined in a constitutionally permissible manner, any use of that aid to indoctrinate cannot be attributed to the government and is thus not of constitutional concern.  And, of course, the use to which the aid is put does not affect the criteria governing the aid's allocation and thus does not create any impermissible incentive under Agostini 's second criterion.  Our recent precedents, particularly <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , require us to reject respondents' argument.  For <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> gave no consideration to divertibility or even to actual diversion.  Had such things mattered to the Court in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , we would have found the case to be quite easyfor striking down rather than, as we did, upholding the programwhich is just how the dissent saw the case. See, e. g., <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 18</citedDecision> (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("Until now, the Court never has authorized a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination"); <citedDecision>id., at 22</citedDecision> ("[G]overnment crosses the boundary when it furnishes the medium for communication of a religious message.  .  .  .  [A] state-employed sign-language interpreter would serve as the conduit for James' religious education, thereby assisting Salpointe [High School] in its mission of religious indoctrination"); <citedDecision>id., at 23</citedDecision> (interpreter *821 "is likely to place the imprimatur of governmental approval upon the favored religion"); see generally <citedDecision>id., at 18-23</citedDecision> .  Quite clearly, then, we did not, as respondents do, think that the use of governmental aid to further religious indoctrination was synonymous with religious indoctrination by the government or that such use of aid created any improper incentives.  Similarly, had we, in Witters , been concerned with divertibility or diversion, we would have unhesitatingly, perhaps summarily, struck down the tuition-reimbursement program, because it was certain that Witters sought to participate in it to acquire an education in a religious career from a sectarian institution.  Diversion was guaranteed.  Mueller took the same view as <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> and Witters , for we did not in Mueller require the State to show that the tax deductions were only for the costs of education in secular subjects.  We declined to impose any such segregation requirement for either the tuition-expense deductions or the deductions for items strikingly similar to those at issue in Meek and Wolman , and here.  See Mueller, 463 U. S., at 391, n. 2 ; see also id., at 414 (Marshall, J., dissenting) ("The instructional materials which are subsidized by the Minnesota tax deduction plainly may be used to inculcate religious values and belief").  Justice O'Connor acknowledges that the Court in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> and Witters approved programs that involved actual diversion.  See post, at 841 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The dissent likewise does not deny that Witters involved actual diversion.  See post, at 895-896, n. 16.  The dissent does claim that the aid in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> "was not considered divertible," post, at 895, n. 16, but the dissent in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , which the author of today's dissent joined, understood the case otherwise.  See supra, at 820.  As that dissent made clear, diversion is the use of government aid to further a religious message.  See <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 21-22</citedDecision> (Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also post, at 842, 857 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  By that definition, the *822 government-provided interpreter in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> was not only divertible, but actually diverted.  Respondents appear to rely on Meek and Wolman to establish their rule against "divertible" aid.  But those cases offer little, if any, support for respondents.  Meek mentioned divertibility only briefly in a concluding footnote, see 421 U. S., at 366, n. 16 , and that mention was, at most, peripheral to the Court's reasoning in striking down the lending of instructional materials and equipment.  The aid program in Wolman explicitly barred divertible aid, 433 U. S., at 248 249, so a concern for divertibility could not have been part of our reason for finding that program invalid.  The issue is not divertibility of aid but rather whether the aid itself has an impermissible content.  Where the aid would be suitable for use in a public school, it is also suitable for use in any private school.  Similarly, the prohibition against the government providing impermissible content resolves the Establishment Clause concerns that exist if aid is actually diverted to religious uses.  [9] In Agostini , we explained <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> by making just this distinction between the content of aid and the use of that aid: "Because the only government aid in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> was the interpreter, who was herself not inculcating any religious messages, no government indoctrination took place." 521 U. S., at 224 (second emphasis added).  Agostini also acknowledged that what the dissenters in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> had charged was essentially true: <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> did effect a "shift .  .  .  in our Establishment Clause law." 521 U. S., at 225 .  The interpreter herself, assuming that she *823 fulfilled her assigned duties, see id., at 224-225 , had "no inherent religious significance," Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 (discussing bus rides in Everson ), and so it did not matter (given the neutrality and private choice involved in the program) that she "would be a mouthpiece for religious instruction," Agostini, supra, at 226 (discussing <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> ).  And just as a government interpreter does not herself inculcate a religious messageeven when she is conveying oneso also a government computer or overhead projector does not itself inculcate a religious message, even when it is conveying one.  In Agostini itself, we approved the provision of public employees to teach secular remedial classes in private schools partly because we concluded that there was no reason to suspect that indoctrinating content would be part of such governmental aid.  See 521 U. S., at 223-225, 226-227, 234-235 .  Relying on <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , we refused to presume that the public teachers would "`inject religious content' " into their classes, 521 U. S., at 225 , especially given certain safeguards that existed; we also saw no evidence that they had done so, id., at 226-227 .  In Allen we similarly focused on content, emphasizing that the textbooks were preapproved by public school authorities and were not "unsuitable for use in the public schools because of religious content." 392 U. S., at 245 .  See Lemon, 403 U. S., at 617 ("We note that the dissenters in Allen seemed chiefly concerned with the pragmatic difficulties involved in ensuring the truly secular content of the textbooks" (emphasis added)).  Although it might appear that a book, because it has a pre-existing content, is not divertible, and thus that lack of divertibility motivated our holding in Allen, it is hard to imagine any book that could not, in even moderately skilled hands, serve to illustrate a religious message.  [10] Post, at 855 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) *824 (agreeing with this point).  Indeed, the plaintiffs in Walker essentially conceded as much.
**Combined Opinion**
 In fact, the risk of improper attribution is less when the aid lacks content, for there is no risk (as there is with books) of the government inadvertently providing improper content.  See Allen, supra, at 255-262 (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Finally, any aid, with or without content, is "divertible" in the sense that it allows schools to "divert" resources.  Yet we have "`not accepted the recurrent argument that all aid is forbidden because aid to one aspect of an institution frees it to spend its other resources on religious ends.' " Regan, 444 U. S., at 658 (quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 743 (1973)).  *825 It is perhaps conceivable that courts could take upon themselves the task of distinguishing among the myriad kinds of possible aid based on the ease of diverting each kind.  But it escapes us how a court might coherently draw any such line. It not only is far more workable, but also is actually related to real concerns about preventing advancement of religion by government, simply to require, as did <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , Agostini , and Allen, that a program of aid to schools not provide improper content and that it determine eligibility and allocate the aid on a permissible basis.  [11] C The dissent serves up a smorgasbord of 11 factors that, depending on the facts of each case "in all its particularity," post, at 877, could be relevant to the constitutionality of a school-aid program.  And those 11 are a bare minimum.  We are reassured that there are likely more.  [12] See post, at 885, 888.  Presumably they will be revealed in future cases, as needed, but at least one additional factor is evident from the dissent itself: The dissent resurrects the concern for political divisiveness that once occupied the Court but that post- Aguilar cases have rightly disregarded.  Compare post, at 868, 872, 901, 902, 909, n. 27, with Agostini, 521 U. S., at 233-234 ; Bowen, 487 U. S., at 617, n. 14 ; Amos, 483 U. S., at 339-340, n. 17 .
**Combined Opinion**
 Agostini of course overruled Aguilar in full and Ball in part, and today Justice O'Connor distances herself from the part of Ball with which she previously agreed, by rejecting the distinction between public and private employees that was so prominent in Agostini .  Compare post, at 858 860, 863-864 (opinion concurring in judgment), with Agostini, supra, at 223-225, 234-235 .  In Witters , a year after Aguilar and Ball , we did not ask whether the Inland Empire School of the Bible was pervasively sectarian.  In Bowen , a 1988 decision, we refused to find facially invalid an aid program (although one not involving schools) whose recipients had, the District Court found, included pervasively sectarian institutions.  See 487 U. S., at 636, 647, 648 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Although we left it open on remand for the District Court to reaffirm its prior finding, we took pains to emphasize the narrowness of the "pervasively sectarian" category, see id., at 620-621 (opinion of the Court), and two *827 Members of the majority questioned whether this category was "well-founded," id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring).  Then, in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> and Agostini , we upheld aid programs to children who attended schools that were not only pervasively sectarian but also were primary and secondary.  <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , in turning away a challenge based on the pervasively sectarian nature of Salpointe Catholic High School, emphasized the presence of private choice and the absence of government-provided sectarian content.  <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 13</citedDecision> .  Agostini , in explaining why the aid program was constitutional, did not bother to mention that pervasively sectarian schools were at issue, [13] see 521 U. S., at 226 235, a fact that was not lost on the dissent, see id., at 249 (opinion of Souter, J.).  In disregarding the nature of the school, <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> and Agostini were merely returning to the approach of Everson and Allen, in which the Court upheld aid programs to students at pervasively sectarian schools.  See post, at 875, 885-886 (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting this fact regarding Everson ); Allen, 392 U. S., at 251-252 (Black, J., dissenting); id., at 262-264, 269-270 , n. (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Second, the religious nature of a recipient should not matter to the constitutional analysis, so long as the recipient adequately furthers the government's secular purpose.  See supra, at 810.  If a program offers permissible aid to the religious (including the pervasively sectarian), the areligious, and the irreligious, it is a mystery which view of religion the government has established, and thus a mystery what the constitutional violation would be.  The pervasively sectarian recipient has not received any special favor, and it is most bizarre that the Court would, as the dissent seemingly does, reserve special hostility for those who take their religion seriously, who think that their religion should affect the whole *828 of their lives, or who make the mistake of being effective in transmitting their views to children.  Third, the inquiry into the recipient's religious views required by a focus on whether a school is pervasively sectarian is not only unnecessary but also offensive.

 But respondents have not contended, nor do we have any reason to think, that this deviation in the allocation to the LEA's leads to deviation in the allocation among schools within each LEA, see §§ 7372(a)(b), and, even if it did, we would not presume that such a deviation created any incentive one way or the other with regard to religion.  Chapter 2 also satisfies the first Agostini criterion.  The program makes a broad array of schools eligible for aid without regard to their religious affiliations or lack thereof.  § 7372; see § 7353(a)(3).  We therefore have no difficulty concluding that Chapter 2 is neutral with regard to religion.  See Agostini, supra, at 225-226 .  Chapter 2 aid also, like the aid in Agostini , <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , and Witters , reaches participating schools only "as a consequence of private decisionmaking." Agostini, supra, at 222 .  Private decisionmaking controls because of the per capita allocation scheme, and those decisions are independent because of the program's neutrality.  See 521 U. S., at 226 .  It is the students and their parents not the governmentwho, through their choice of school, determine who receives Chapter 2 funds.  The aid follows the child. *831 Because Chapter 2 aid is provided pursuant to private choices, it is not problematic that one could fairly describe Chapter 2 as providing "direct" aid.  The materials and equipment provided under Chapter 2 are presumably used from time to time by entire classes rather than by individual students (although individual students are likely the chief consumers of library books and, perhaps, of computers and computer software), and students themselves do not need to apply for Chapter 2 aid in order for their schools to receive it, but, as we explained in Agostini , these traits are not constitutionally significant or meaningful.
**Combined Opinion**
 To put the point differently, if the government, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without regard to religion, to all who adequately further that purpose, then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose." Ante, at 809-810 (citation omitted).  I agree with Justice Souter that the plurality, by taking such a stance, "appears to take evenhandedness neutrality and in practical terms promote it to a single and sufficient test for the establishment constitutionality of school aid." Post, at 900 (dissenting opinion).  I do not quarrel with the plurality's recognition that neutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs against Establishment Clause challenges.  Our cases have described neutrality in precisely this manner, and we have emphasized a program's neutrality repeatedly in our decisions approving various forms of school aid.  See, e. g., Agostini, supra, at 228, 231-232 ; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., <citedDecision>509 U. S. 1, 10</citedDecision> (1993); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487-488 (1986); id., at 493 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring *839 in judgment); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397-399 (1983).  Nevertheless, we have never held that a government-aid program passes constitutional muster solely because of the neutral criteria it employs as a basis for distributing aid.  For example, in Agostini , neutrality was only one of several factors we considered in determining that New York City's Title I program did not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  See 521 U. S., at 226-228 (noting lack of evidence of inculcation of religion by Title I instructors, legal requirement that Title I services be supplemental to regular curricula, and that no Title I funds reached religious schools' coffers).  Indeed, given that the aid in Agostini had secular content and was distributed on the basis of wholly neutral criteria, our consideration of additional factors demonstrates that the plurality's rule does not accurately describe our recent Establishment Clause jurisprudence.  See also <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 10, 12-13</citedDecision> (noting that no government funds reached religious school's coffers, aid did not relieve school of expense it otherwise would have assumed, and aid was not distributed to school but to the child).  Justice Souter provides a comprehensive review of our Establishment Clause cases on government aid to religious institutions that is useful for its explanation of the various ways in which we have used the term "neutrality" in our decisions.  See post, at 878-883.  Even if we at one time used the term "neutrality" in a descriptive sense to refer to those aid programs characterized by the requisite equipoise between support of religion and antagonism to religion, Justice Souter's discussion convincingly demonstrates that the evolution in the meaning of the term in our jurisprudence is cause to hesitate before equating the neutrality of recent decisions with the neutrality of old.  As I have previously explained, neutrality is important, but it is by no means the only "axiom in the history and precedent of the Establishment Clause." Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 846 (1995) (concurring opinion).  Thus, *840 I agree with Justice Souter's conclusion that our "most recent use of `neutrality' to refer to generality or evenhandedness of distribution .
**Combined Opinion**
 See Agostini, supra, at 226-227 ("[N]o evidence has ever shown that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students"); Allen, supra, at 248 ("Nothing in this record supports the proposition that all textbooks, whether they deal with mathematics, physics, foreign languages, history, or literature, are used by the parochial schools to teach religion").  Of course, our focus on the lack of such evidence would have been entirely unnecessary if we had believed that the Establishment Clause permits the actual diversion of secular government aid to religious indoctrination.  Our decision in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589 (1988), also demonstrates that actual diversion is constitutionally impermissible.  After concluding *841 that the government-aid program in question was constitutional on its face, we remanded the case so that the District Court could determine, after further factual development, whether aid recipients had used the government aid to support their religious objectives.  See id., at 621-622 ; id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., concurring) ("[T]he only purpose of further inquiring whether any particular grantee institution is pervasively sectarian is as a preliminary step to demonstrating that the funds are in fact being used to further religion").  The remand would have been unnecessary if, as the plurality contends, actual diversion were irrelevant under the Establishment Clause.  The plurality bases its holding that actual diversion is permissible on Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> .  Ante, at 820-821.  Those decisions, however, rested on a significant factual premise missing from this case, as well as from the majority of cases thus far considered by the Court involving Establishment Clause challenges to school aid programs.  Specifically, we decided Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> on the understanding that the aid was provided directly to the individual student who, in turn, made the choice of where to put that aid to use.  See Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 ; Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 10, 12</citedDecision> .  Accordingly, our approval of the aid in both cases relied to a significant extent on the fact that "[a]ny aid .  .  .  that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients." Witters, supra, at 487 ; see <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 10</citedDecision> ("[A] government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents").  This characteristic of both programs made them less like a direct subsidy, which would be impermissible under the Establishment Clause, and more akin to the government issuing a paycheck to an employee who, in turn, donates a portion of that check to a religious institution.  See, e. g., Witters, supra, at 486-487 ; see also Rosenberger, supra, at 848 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (discussing Witters ).  *842 Recognizing this distinction, the plurality nevertheless finds Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> to the extent those decisions might permit the use of government aid for religious purposesrelevant in any case involving a neutral, per-capitaaid program.  See ante, at 830-831.  Like Justice Souter, I do not believe that we should treat a per-capita-aid program the same as the true private-choice programs considered in Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> .  See post, at 902.  First, when the government provides aid directly to the student beneficiary, that student can attend a religious school and yet retain control over whether the secular government aid will be applied toward the religious education.  The fact that aid flows to the religious school and is used for the advancement of religion is therefore wholly dependent on the student's private decision.  See Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 848 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (discussing importance of private choice in Witters ); Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 ("[T]he fact that aid goes to individuals means that the decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not by the State"); id., at 493 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("The aid to religion at issue here is the result of petitioner's private choice").  It is for this reason that in Agostini we relied on Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> to reject the rule "that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid," 521 U. S., at 225 , yet also rested our approval of New York City's Title I program in part on the lack of evidence of actual diversion, id., at 226-227 .  Second, I believe the distinction between a per capita school aid program and a true private-choice program is significant for purposes of endorsement.  See, e. g., Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 692 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring).  In terms of public perception, a government program of direct aid to religious schools based on the number of students attending each school differs meaningfully from the government distributing aid directly to individual students *843 who, in turn, decide to use the aid at the same religious schools.  In the former example, if the religious school uses the aid to inculcate religion in its students, it is reasonable to say that the government has communicated a message of endorsement.  Because the religious indoctrination is supported by government assistance, the reasonable observer would naturally perceive the aid program as government support for the advancement of religion.  That the amount of aid received by the school is based on the school's enrollment does not separate the government from the endorsement of the religious message.

 In Ball , a companion case to Aguilar , we also held that a similar program in Grand Rapids, Michigan, violated the Constitution.  Our decisions in Aguilar and Ball were both based on a presumption, drawn in large part from Meek , see 421 U. S., at 367-373 , that public-school instructors who teach secular classes on the campuses of religious schools will inevitably inculcate religion in their students.  In Agostini , we recognized that "[o]ur more recent cases [had] undermined the assumptions upon which Ball and Aguilar relied." 521 U. S., at 222 .  First, we explained that the Court had since abandoned "the presumption erected in Meek and Ball that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion." Id., at 223.  Rather, relying on <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , we explained that in the absence of evidence showing that teachers were actually using the Title I aid to inculcate religion, we would presume that the instructors would comply with the program's secular restrictions.  See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-224 , 226 227.  The Title I services were required by statute to be "`secular, neutral, and nonideological.' " Id., at 210 (quoting 20 U. S. C. § 6321 (a)(2)).  Second, we noted that the Court had "departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid." Agostini, supra, at 225 .  Relying on Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , we noted that our cases had taken a more forgiving view of neutral government programs that make aid available generally without regard to the religious or nonreligious character of the recipient school.  See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 225-226 .  With respect to the specific Title I program *848 at issue, we noted several factors that precluded us from finding an impermissible financing of religious indoctrination: the aid was "provided to students at whatever school they choose to attend," the services were "by law supplemental to the regular curricula" of the benefited schools, "[n]o Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools," and there was no evidence of Title I instructors having "attempted to inculcate religion in students." Id., at 226-228 .  Relying on the same factors, we also concluded that the New York City program could not "reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion." Id., at 235 .  Although we found it relevant that Title I services could not be provided on a schoolwide basis, we also explained that this fact was likely a sufficient rather than a necessary condition of the program's constitutionality.
**Combined Opinion**
 See Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362 ; Allen, 392 U. S., at 248 .  Just as we held in Agostini that our more recent cases had undermined the assumptions underlying Ball and Aguilar , I would now hold that Agostini and the cases on which it relied have undermined the assumptions underlying Meek and Wolman .  To be sure, Agostini only addressed the specific presumption that public-school employees teaching on the premises of religious schools would inevitably inculcate religion.  Nevertheless, I believe that our definitive rejection of that presumption also stood foror at least strongly *858 pointed tothe broader proposition that such presumptions of religious indoctrination are normally inappropriate when evaluating neutral school aid programs under the Establishment Clause.  In Agostini , we repeatedly emphasized that it would be inappropriate to presume inculcation of religion; rather, plaintiffs raising an Establishment Clause challenge must present evidence that the government aid in question has resulted in religious indoctrination.  See 521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-227 .  We specifically relied on our statement in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> that a presumption of indoctrination, because it constitutes an absolute bar to the aid in question regardless of the religious school's ability to separate that aid from its religious mission, constitutes a "flat rule, smacking of antiquated notions of `taint,' [that] would indeed exalt form over substance." <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 13</citedDecision> .  That reasoning applies with equal force to the presumption in Meek and Ball concerning instructional materials and equipment.  As we explained in Agostini , "we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid." 521 U. S., at 225 .  Respondents contend that Agostini should be limited to its facts, and point specifically to the following statement from my separate opinion in Ball as the basis for retaining a presumption of religious inculcation for instructional materials and equipment: "When full-time parochial school teachers receive public funds to teach secular courses to their parochial school students under parochial school supervision, I agree that the program has the perceived and actual effect of advancing the religious aims of the church-related schools.  This is particularly the case where, as here, religion pervades the curriculum and the teachers are accustomed to bring religion to play in everything they teach." 473 U. S., at 399-400 (concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).
**Combined Opinion**
 Even though both Everson and Allen had anticipated some such distinction, neither case had used the term "neutral" in this way.  In Everson , Justice Black indicated that providing *880 police, fire, and similar government services to religious institutions was permissible, in part because they were "so separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function." 330 U. S., at 18 .  Allen similarly focused on the fact that the textbooks lent out were "secular" and approved by secular authorities, 392 U. S., at 245 , and assumed that the secular textbooks and the secular elements of education they supported were not so intertwined with religious instruction as "in fact [to be] instrumental in the teaching of religion," id., at 248 .  Such was the Court's premise in Lemon for shifting the use of the word "neutral" from labeling the required position of the government to describing a benefit that was nonreligious.  We spoke of "[o]ur decisions from Everson to Allen [as] permitt[ing] the States to provide church-related schools with secular, neutral, or nonideological services, facilities, or materials," 403 U. S., at 616, and thereafter, we regularly used "neutral" in this second sense of "secular" or "nonreligious." See, e. g., Tilton, supra, at 687-688 (characterizing subsidized teachers in Lemon as "not necessarily religiously neutral," but buildings as "religiously neutral"); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 365-366 (1975) (describing instructional materials as "`secular, nonideological and neutral' " and "wholly neutral"); id., at 372 (describing auxiliary services as "religiously neutral"); Roemer, supra, at 751 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (describing Tilton `s approved buildings as "neutral or nonideological in nature"); 426 U. S., at 754 (describing Meek `s speech and hearing services as "neutral and nonideological"); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., <citedDecision>509 U. S. 1, 10</citedDecision> (1993) (discussing translator as "neutral service"); Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 232 (1997) (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was "neutral and nonideological"); cf. Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 478 (1973) (noting that District Court approved testing cost reimbursement as payment for services that were "`secular, neutral, or nonideological' " in character, citing Lemon, 403 U. S., at *881 616); Wolman, supra, at 242 (quoting Lemon, supra, at 616 (describing permitted services aid as "secular, neutral, or nonideological")).  The shift from equipoise to secular was not, however, our last redefinition, for the Court again transformed the sense of "neutrality" in the 1980's.  Reexamining and reinterpreting Everson and Allen, we began to use the word "neutral" to mean "evenhanded," in the sense of allocating aid on some common basis to religious and secular recipients.  Again, neither Everson nor Allen explicitly used "neutral" in this manner, but just as the label for equipoise had lent itself to referring to the secular characteristic of what a government might provide, it was readily adaptable to referring to the generality of government services, as in Everson `s paradigms, to which permissible benefits were compared.  The increased attention to a notion of evenhanded distribution was evident in Nyquist , where the Court distinguished the program under consideration from the government services approved in Allen and Everson , in part because "the class of beneficiaries [in Everson and Allen ] included all schoolchildren, those in public as well as those in private schools." 413 U. S ., at 782, n. 38.  Nyquist then reserved the question whether "some form of public assistance .

 Meek , for example, characterized Everson and Allen as approving "a general program" to pay bus fares and to lend school books, respectively, 421 U. S., at 360 ; id., at 360, n. 8 (approving two similar "general program[s]" in New York and Pennsylvania), and Wolman upheld diagnostic services described as "`general welfare services for children,' " 433 U. S., at 243 (quoting Meek, supra, at 371, n. 21).  *882 Justice Blackmun, writing in Roemer , first called such a "general" or evenhanded program "neutral," in speaking of "facial neutrality" as a relevant consideration in determining whether there was an Establishment Clause violation.  "[R]eligious institutions need not be quarantined from public benefits that are neutrally available to all." 426 U. S., at 746-747 ; see also id., at 746 (discussing buses in Everson and school books in Allen as examples of "neutrally available" aid).  In Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983), the Court adopted the redefinition of neutrality as evenhandedness, citing Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38 , and alluding to our discussion of equal access in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981).  The Court upheld a system of tax deductions for sectarian educational expenses, in part because such a "facially neutral law," 463 U. S., at 401 , made the deduction available for " all parents, including those whose children attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools," id., at 397 .  Subsequent cases carried the point forward.  See, e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487 (1986) (quoting Nyquist and characterizing program as making aid "available generally"); <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra,  at 8-9</citedDecision> (discussing "government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion" and citing Mueller and Witters ); Agostini, supra, at 231 (discussing aid allocated on the basis of "neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, .  .  .  made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis"); see also Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 839 ("[T]he guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse").  In sum, "neutrality" originally entered this field of jurisprudence as a conclusory term, a label for the required relationship *883 between the government and religion as a state of equipoise between government as ally and government as adversary.  Reexamining Everson `s paradigm cases to derive a prescriptive guideline, we first determined that "neutral" aid was secular, nonideological, or unrelated to religious education.  Our subsequent reexamination of Everson and Allen, beginning in Nyquist and culminating in Mueller and most recently in Agostini , recast neutrality as a concept of "evenhandedness."
**Combined Opinion**
 First, we have recognized the fact that the overriding religious mission of certain schools, those sometimes called *886 "pervasively sectarian," is not confined to a discrete element of the curriculum, Everson, 330 U. S., at 22-24 (Jackson, J., dissenting); id., at 45-47 (Rutledge, J., dissenting), but permeates their teaching.  [6] Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 671 (1970); Lemon, supra, at 636-637 ("A school which operates to commingle religion with other instruction plainly cannot completely secularize its instruction.  Parochial schools, in large measure, do not accept the assumption that secular subjects should be unrelated to religious teaching"); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 621-622 (1988) (discussing pervasively sectarian private schools).  Based on record evidence and long experience, we have concluded that religious teaching in such schools is at the core of the instructors' individual and personal obligations, cf. Canon 803, § 2, Text & Commentary 568 ("It is necessary that the formation and education given in a Catholic school be based upon the principles of Catholic doctrine; teachers are to be outstanding for their correct doctrine and integrity of life"), and that individual religious teachers will teach religiously.  [7] Lemon, 403 U. S., at 615-620 ; id., at 635 *887 641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 ; Meek, 421 U. S., at 369-371 ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 249-250 (discussing nonseverability of religious and secular education); Ball, 473 U. S., at 399-400 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by Agostini, 521 U. S., at 236 .  As religious teaching cannot be separated from secular education in such schools or by such teachers, we have concluded that direct government subsidies to such schools are prohibited because they will inevitably and impermissibly support religious indoctrination.  Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 12</citedDecision> (discussing Meek and Ball ).  Second, we have expressed special concern about aid to primary and secondary religious schools.  Tilton, 403 U. S., at 685-686 .  On the one hand, we have understood how the youth of the students in such schools makes them highly susceptible to religious indoctrination.  Lemon, supra, at 616 ("This process of inculcating religious doctrine is, of course, enhanced by the impressionable age of the pupils, in primary schools particularly").  On the other, we have recognized that the religious element in the education offered in most sectarian primary and secondary schools is far more intertwined with the secular than in university teaching, where the natural and academic skepticism of most older students may separate the two, see Tilton, supra, at 686-689 ; Roemer, 426 U. S., at 750 .  Thus, government benefits accruing to these pervasively religious primary and secondary schools raise special dangers of diversion into support for the religious indoctrination of children and the involvement of government in religious training and practice.  *888 2 We have also evaluated the portent of support to an organization's religious mission that may be inherent in the method by which aid is granted, finding pertinence in at least two characteristics of distribution.  First, we have asked whether aid is direct or indirect, observing distinctions between government schemes with individual beneficiaries and those whose beneficiaries in the first instance might be religious schools.  Everson, supra, at 18 (bus fare supports parents and not schools); Allen, 392 U. S., 243 -244, and n. 6 (textbooks go to benefit children and parents, not schools); Lemon, supra, at 621 (invalidating direct aid to schools); Levitt, supra, at 480, 482 (invalidating direct testing aid to schools); Witters, 474 U. S., at 487-488 (evaluating whether aid was a direct subsidy to schools).  Direct aid obviously raises greater risks, although recent cases have discounted this risk factor, looking to other features of the distribution mechanism.  Agostini, supra, at 225-226 .  [8] *889 Second, we have distinguished between indirect aid that reaches religious schools only incidentally as a result of numerous individual choices and aid that is in reality directed to religious schools by the government or in practical terms selected by religious schools themselves.  Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 ; Witters, supra, at 488 ; <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 10</citedDecision> .  In these cases, we have declared the constitutionality of programs providing aid directly to parents or students as tax deductions or scholarship money, where such aid may pay for education at some sectarian institutions, Mueller, supra, at 399 ; Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , but only as the result of "genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients," id., at 487 .  We distinguished this path of aid from the route in Ball and Wolman , where the opinions indicated that "[w]here .  .  .  no meaningful distinction can be made between aid to the student and aid to the school, the concept of a loan to individuals is a transparent fiction." 474 U. S., at 487, n. 4 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  [9] 3 In addition to the character of the school to which the benefit accrues, and its path from government to school, a number of features of the aid itself have figured in the classifications *890 we have made.  First, we have barred aid with actual religious content, which would obviously run afoul of the ban on the government's participation in religion, Everson, 330 U. S., at 16 ; Walz, 397 U. S., at 668 ; cf. Lemon, 403 U. S., at 617 (discussing variable ideological and religious character of religious teachers compared to fixed content of books).  In cases where we have permitted aid, we have regularly characterized it as "neutral" in the sense (noted supra, at 879 881) of being without religious content.  See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 688 (characterizing buildings as "religiously neutral"); Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> (describing translator as "neutral service"); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 232 (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was "neutral and nonideological").  See also ante, at 820 (plurality opinion) (barring aid with religious content).  [10] Second, we have long held government aid invalid when circumstances would allow its diversion to religious education.  The risk of diversion is obviously high when aid in the form of government funds makes its way into the coffers of religious organizations, and so from the start we have understood the Constitution to bar outright money grants of aid to religion.  [11] See Everson, 330 U.

**Combined Opinion**
 And the most recent example of attention to the significance of divertibility occurred in our explanation that public school teachers could be assigned to provide limited instruction in religious schools in Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-227 , a majority of the Court rejecting the factual assumption that public school teachers could be readily lured into providing religious instruction.  [16] *896 Third, our cases have recognized the distinction, adopted by statute in the Chapter 2 legislation, between aid that merely supplements and aid that supplants expenditures for offerings at religious schools, the latter being barred.  Although we have never adopted the position that any benefit that flows to a religious school is impermissible because it frees up resources for the school to engage in religious indoctrination, Hunt, supra, at 743 , from our first decision holding it permissible to provide textbooks for religious schools we have repeatedly explained the unconstitutionality of aid that supplants an item of the school's traditional expense.  See, e. g., Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370, 375 (1930) (noting that religious schools "are not the beneficiaries of these appropriations.  They obtain nothing from them, nor are they relieved of a single obligation because of them" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Everson, 330 U. S., at 18 (specifically noting that bus fare program did not support or fund religious schools); Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 (stating that "the financial benefit [of providing the textbooks] is to parents and children, not to schools" (footnote omitted)); id., *897 at 244, n. 6 (explicitly recognizing that "the record contains no evidence that any of the private schools in appellants' districts previously provided textbooks for their students"); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 656 (opinion of Brennan, J.) (noting no aid to schools was involved in Allen ).  We ignored this prohibition only once, in Regan, 444 U. S., at 646 ; see also ante, at 16, n. 7, where reimbursement for budgeted expenses of required testing was not struck down, but we then quickly returned to the rule as a guideline for permissible aid.  [17] In Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 12</citedDecision> , the Court specifically distinguished Meek and Ball by explaining that the invalid programs in those cases "relieved sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students." In Agostini , the Court made a point of noting that the objects of the aid were "by law supplemental to the regular curricula" and, citing <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , explained that the remedial education services did not relieve the religious schools of costs they would otherwise have borne.  521 U. S., at 228 (citing <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 12</citedDecision> ).  The Court explicitly stated that the *898 services in question did not "supplant the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already provided in New York City's sectarian schools." 521 U. S., at 229 .  Finally, we have recognized what is obvious (however imprecise), in holding "substantial" amounts of aid to be unconstitutional whether or not a plaintiff can show that it supplants a specific item of expense a religious school would have borne.  [18] In Meek, 421 U. S., at 366 , we invalidated the loan of instructional materials to religious schools because "faced with the substantial amounts of direct support authorized by [the program], it would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania's church-related elementary and secondary schools and then characterize [the program] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian." Id., at 365 .  See id., at 366 ("Substantial aid to the educational function of such schools .
**Combined Opinion**
 .  necessarily results in aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole"); see also Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 783 ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 250-251 .  In Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , the Court asked whether the aid in question was a direct subsidy to religious schools and addressed the substantiality of the aid obliquely in noting that "nothing in the record indicates that .  .  .  any significant portion of the *899 aid expended under the Washington program as a whole will end up flowing to religious education." In <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra,  at 12</citedDecision> , the Court spoke of the substantiality test in Meek , noting that "[d]isabled children, not sectarian schools, are the primary beneficiaries of the [Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA)]; to the extent sectarian schools benefit at all from the IDEA, they are only incidental beneficiaries." C This stretch of doctrinal history leaves one point clear beyond peradventure: together with James Madison we have consistently understood the Establishment Clause to impose a substantive prohibition against public aid to religion and, hence, to the religious mission of sectarian schools.  Evenhandedness neutrality is one, nondispositive pointer toward an intent and (to a lesser degree) probable effect on the permissible side of the line between forbidden aid and general public welfare benefit.  Other pointers are facts about the religious mission and education level of benefited schools and their pupils, the pathway by which a benefit travels from public treasury to educational effect, the form and content of the aid, its adaptability to religious ends, and its effects on school budgets.  The object of allenquiries into such matters is the same whatever the particular circumstances: is the benefit intended to aid in providing the religious element of the education and is it likely to do so?  The substance of the law has thus not changed since Everson .  Emphasis on one sort of fact or another has varied depending on the perceived utility of the enquiry, but all that has been added is repeated explanation of relevant considerations, confirming that our predecessors were right in their prophecies that no simple test would emerge to allow easy application of the establishment principle.
**Combined Opinion**
 The concern with divertibility thus predicated is underscored by the fact that the religious schools in question here covered the primary and secondary grades, the grades in which the sectarian nature of instruction is characteristically the most pervasive, see Lemon, 403 U. S., at 616 ; cf. Tilton, 403 U. S., at 686-689 , and in which pupils are the least critical of the schools' religious objectives, see Lemon, supra, at 616 .  No one, indeed, disputes the trial judge's findings, based on a detailed record, that the Roman Catholic schools, [21] which made up the majority of the private schools participating, [22] were pervasively sectarian, [23] that *905 their common objective and mission was to engage in religious education, [24] and that their teachers taught religiously, [25] making them precisely the kind of primary and *906 secondary religious schools that raise the most serious Establishment Clause concerns.  See Walz, 397 U. S., at 671 ; Hunt, 413 U. S., at 743 ; Lemon, supra, at 636-637 .  The threat to Establishment Clause values was accordingly at its highest in the circumstances of this case. Such precautionary features as there were in the Jefferson Parish scheme were grossly inadequate to counter the threat.  To be sure, the disbursement of the aid was subject to statutory admonitions against diversion, see, e. g., 20 U. S. C. §§ 7332 , 8897, and was supposedly subject to a variety of safeguards, see ante, at 802-803, 832-834.  But the provisions for on site monitoring visits, labeling of government property, and government oversight cannot be accepted as sufficient in the face of record evidence that the safeguard provisions proved to be empty phrases in Jefferson Parish.  Cf. Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228-229 ; Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 13</citedDecision> (accepting precautionary provisions in absence of evidence of their uselessness).  The plurality has already noted at length the ineffectiveness of the government's monitoring program.  Ante, at 832-834; see also App. 111a ("A system to monitor nonpublic schools was often not in operation and therefore the [local educational agency] did not always know: (a) what was purchased or (b) how it was utilized").  Monitors visited a nonpublic school only sporadically, discussed the program with a single contact person, observed nothing more than attempts at recordkeeping, and failed to inform the teachers of the restrictions involved.  <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 154a155a.  Although Chapter 2 required labeling of government property, it occurred haphazardly at best, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 113a, and the government's sole monitoring system for computer use amounted to nothing more *907 than questioning school officials and examining the location of computers at the schools, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 118a.  No records of software and computer use were kept, and no such recordkeeping was even planned.  <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 118a, 164a166a.  State and local officials in Jefferson Parish admitted that nothing prevented the Chapter 2 computers from being used for religious instruction, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 102a, 118a, 164a166a, and although they knew of methods of monitoring computer usage, such as locking the computer functions, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 165a166a, they implemented no particular policies, instituted no systems, and employed no technologies to minimize the likelihood of diversion to religious uses, [26] <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 118a, 165a166a.  The watchdogs did require the religious schools to give not so much as an assurance that they would use Chapter 2 computers solely for secular purposes, Helms v. Picard, 151 F. 3d 347, 368 (1998), amended, 165 F. 3d 311 (CA5 1999); App. 94a95a.  Government officials themselves admitted that there was no way to tell whether instructional materials had been diverted, id., at 118a, 139a, 144a145a, and, as the plurality notes, the only screening mechanism in the library book scheme was a review of titles by a single government official, ante, at 832-833, n. 15; see App. 137a .  The government did not even have a policy on the consequences of noncompliance.  Id., at 145a.  The risk of immediate diversion of Chapter 2 benefits had its complement in the risk of future diversion, against which the Jefferson Parish program had absolutely no protection.  By statute all purchases with Chapter 2 aid were to remain the property of the United States, 20 U. S. C. § 7372 (c)(1), merely being "lent" to the recipient nonpublic schools.

Post, at 838 (opinion concurring in judgment).  [6]  The majority opinion also noted that only a small portion of the overall aid under the State's program would go to religious education, see Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , but it appears that five Members of the Court thought this point irrelevant.  See id., at 491, n. 3 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring) (citing Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 401 (1983), to assert that validity of program "does not depend on the fact that petitioner appears to be the only handicapped student who has sought to use his assistance to pursue religious training"); 474 U. S., at 490 (White, J., concurring) (agreeing with "most of Justice Powell's concurring opinion with respect to the relevance of Mueller , " but not specifying further); id., at 493 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (agreeing with Justice Powell's reliance on Mueller and explaining that the program did not have an impermissible effect, because it was neutral and involved private choice, and thus "[n]o reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts before us an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief").  More recently, in Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997), we held that the proportion of aid benefiting students at religious schools pursuant to a neutral program involving private choices was irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry.  Id., at 229 (refusing "to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid"); see also post, at 848 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting this passage).  [7]  Respondents also contend that Chapter 2 aid supplants, rather than supplements, the core educational function of parochial schools and therefore has the effect of furthering religion.  Our case law does provide some indication that this distinction may be relevant to determining whether aid results in governmental indoctrination, see Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228-229 ; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., <citedDecision>509 U. S. 1, 12</citedDecision> (1993); but see School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 396 (1985), but we have never delineated the distinction's contours or held that it is constitutionally required.  Nor, to the extent that the supplement/supplant line is separable from respondents' direct/indirect and "no divertibility" arguments, do we need to resolve the distinction's constitutional status today, for, as we have already noted, Chapter 2 itself requires that aid may only be supplemental.  20 U. S. C. § 7371 (b).  See also post, at 867 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (declining to decide whether supplement/supplant distinction is a constitutional requirement); but see post, at 852 (explaining that computers are "necessary" to "the educational process").  We presume that whether a parish has complied with that statutory requirement would be, at the very least, relevant to whether a violation of any constitutional supplement/supplant requirement has occurred, yet we have no reason to believe that there has been any material statutory violation.  A statewide review by the Louisiana SEA indicated that § 7371(b) receives nearly universal compliance.  App. 112a.
**Combined Opinion**
 We approved a similar arrangement in Quick Bear, 210 U. S., at 77-82 , and the Federal Government appears to have long had such a program, see 1999 Catalog of Caring: Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area 44, 45, 59, 74-75 (listing numerous religious organizations, many of which engage in religious education or in proselytizing, to which federal employees may contribute via payroll deductions); see generally Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788 (1985) (discussing Combined Federal Campaign).  Finally, at least some of our prior cases striking down direct payments involved serious concerns about whether the payments were truly neutral.  See, e. g., Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 762-764, 768, 774-780 (1973) (striking down, by 8-to-1 vote, program providing direct grants for maintenance and repair of school facilities, where payments were allocated per-pupil but were only available to private, nonprofit schools in low-income areas, "`all or practically all'" of which were Catholic).  Id., at 768 .  [9]  The dissent would find an establishment of religion if a governmentprovided projector were used in a religious school to show a privately purchased religious film, even though a public school that possessed the same kind of projector would likely be constitutionally barred from refusing to allow a student bible club to use that projector in a classroom to show the very same film, where the classrooms and projectors were generally available to student groups.  See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993).  [10]  Although we did, elsewhere in Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968), observe, in response to a party's argument, that there was no evidence that the schools were using secular textbooks to somehow further religious instruction, see id., at 248 , we had no occasion to say what the consequence would be were such use occurring and, more importantly, we think that this brief concluding comment cannot be read, especially after <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> (not to mention Witters , Mueller , and Agostini ) as essential to the reasoning of Allen.  [11]  Justice O'Connor agrees that the Constitution does not bar divertible aid.  See post, at 857 (opinion concurring in judgment).  She also finds actual diversion unproblematic if "true private-choice" directs the aid.  See post, at 842.  And even when there is not such private choice, she thinks that some amount of actual diversion is tolerable and that safeguards for preventing and detecting actual diversion may be minimal, as we explain further, infra, at 832-834.  [12]  It is thus surprising for the dissent to accuse us of following a rule of "breathtaking .
**Combined Opinion**
 See 392 U. S., at 252 (Black, J., dissenting); id., at 272 (Fortas, J., dissenting).  [6]  In fact, religious education in Roman Catholic schools is defined as part of required religious practice; aiding it is thus akin to aiding a church service.  See 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 798, reprinted in The Code of Canon Law: A Text and Commentary 566 (1985) (hereinafter Text & Commentary) (directing parents to entrust children to Roman Catholic schools or otherwise provide for Roman Catholic education); Canon 800, § 2, Text & Commentary 567 (requiring the faithful to support establishment and maintenance of Roman Catholic schools); Canons 802, 804, Text & Commentary 567, 568 (requiring diocesan bishop to establish and regulate schools "imparting an education imbued with the Christian spirit").  [7]  Although the Court no longer assumes that public school teachers assigned to religious schools for limited purposes will teach religiously, see Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 223-228 (1997), we have never abandoned the presumption that religious teachers will teach just that way.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 615-620 (1971); id., at 635-641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 480 (1973); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 369-371 (1975); Wol- man v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 249-250 (1977); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 399-400 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by Agostini, supra, at 236 .  Cf. NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 504 (1979) ("The church-teacher relationship in a church-operated school differs from the employment relationship in a public or other nonreligious school").  [8]  In Agostini , the Court indicated that "we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid," 521 U. S., at 225 , and cited Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., <citedDecision>509 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1993).  However, Agostini did not rely on this dictum, instead clearly stating that "[w]hile it is true that individual students may not directly apply for Title I services, it does not follow from this premise that those services are distributed `directly to the religious schools.' In fact, they are not.  No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a schoolwide basis." 521 U. S., at 228-229 (citations omitted).  Until today, this Court has never permitted aid to go directly to schools on a schoolwide basis.  The plurality misreads our precedent in suggesting that we have abandoned directness of distribution as a relevant consideration.  See ante, at 815-818.  In Wolman , we stated that nominally describing aid as to students would not bar a court from finding that it actually provided a subsidy to a school, 433 U. S., at 250 , but we did not establish that a program giving "direct" aid to schools was therefore permissible.  In Witters , we made the focus of Wolman clear, continuing to examine aid to determine if it was a "direct subsidy" to a school, 474 U. S., at 487 , and distinguishing the aid at issue from impermissible aid in Ball and Wolman precisely because the designation of the student as recipient in those cases was only nominal.  474 U. S., at 487, n. 4 .  Our subsequent cases have continued to ask whether government aid programs constituted impermissible "direct subsidies" to religious schools even where they are directed by individual choice.  <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 11-13</citedDecision> ; Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 399 (1983); Agostini, supra, at 226 .  [9]  We have also permitted the government to supply students with public-employee translators, <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 10</citedDecision> , and public-employee special education teachers, Agostini, supra, at 226, 228 , who directly provided them with government services in whatever schools those specific students attended, public or nonpublic.  I have already noted Agostini `s limitations.  See n. 8, supra. [10]  I agree with the plurality that the Establishment Clause absolutely prohibits the government from providing aid with clear religious content to religious, or for that matter nonreligious, schools.  Ante, at 822-825.  The plurality, however, misreads our precedent as focusing only on affirmatively religious content.  At the very least, a building, for example, has no such content, but we have squarely required the government to ensure that no publicly financed building be diverted to religious use.  Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 681-684 (1971).
**Combined Opinion**
 [14]  Contrary to the plurality's apparent belief, Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993), sheds no light on the question of divertibility and school aid.  Ante, at 822, n. 9.  The Court in that case clearly distinguished the question of afterschool access to public facilities from anything resembling the school aid cases: "The showing of this film series would not have been during school hours, would not have been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to the public, not just to church members." 508 U. S., at 395.  [15]  In Lemon , we also specifically examined the risk that a government program that paid religious teachers would support religious education; the teachers posed the risk of being unable to separate secular from religious education.  Although we invalidated the program on entanglement grounds, we suggested that the monitoring the State had established in that case was actually required to eliminate the risk of diversion.  See 403 U. S., at 619; see also n. 11, supra. [16]  The plurality is mistaken in its reading of <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> .  See ante, at 820 821.  <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> does not reject the principle of divertibility.  There the government provided only a translator who was not considered divertible because he did not add to or subtract from the religious message.  The Court approved the translator as it would approve a hearing aid, health services, diagnostics, and tests.  See Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 13</citedDecision> , and n. 10.  Cf. Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U. S. 291, 299-300 (1899); Wolman, 433 U. S., at 244 .  <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> thus can be thought of as akin to our approval of diagnostic services in Wolman, supra, at 244 , which we considered to have "little or no educational content[,] not [to be] closely associated with the educational mission of the nonpublic school," and not to pose "an impermissible risk of the fostering of ideological views." The fact that the dissent saw things otherwise (as the plurality points out, ante, at 821) is beside the point here.  Similarly, the plurality is mistaken in reading our holdings in Mueller and Witters , see ante, at 821, to undermine divertibility as a relevant principle.  First, these cases approved quite factually distinct types of aid; Mueller involving tax deductions, which have a quite separate history of approval, see 463 U. S., at 396 , and nn. 5, 6 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970)), and Witters involving scholarship money distributed to a university, not a primary or secondary school, see Tilton, 403 U. S., at 685-686 , that was not significant enough as a whole to support that institution, Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 .  Second, in neither case did the program at issue provide direct aid on a schoolwide basis (as Chapter 2 does here); in both we found a distinction based on the genuinely independent, private choices which allocated such very different types of aid (tax deductions and university scholarship money that did not amount to substantial support of the university).  See Mueller, supra, at 399 ; Witters, supra, at 488 .  [17]  Our departure from this principle in Regan is not easily explained, but it is an isolated holding surrounded by otherwise unbroken adherence to the no-supplanting principle.  Long after Regan we have continued to find the supplement/supplant distinction, like the bar to substantial aid, to be an important consideration.  See <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 12</citedDecision> ; Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228 ; cf. Witters, supra, at 487-488 (discussing rule against "direct subsidy").  The weight that the plurality places on Regan is thus too much for it to bear.  See ante, at 815, n. 7.  Moreover, the apparent object of the Regan Court's concern was vindicating the principle that aid with fixed secular content was permissible, distinguishing it from the divertible testing aid in Levitt .  Regan, 444 U. S., at 661 -662 (citing Wolman, supra, at 263 ); cf. Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 .  The plurality provides no explanation for our continued reference to the principle of no-supplanting aid in subsequent cases, such as <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> and Agostini , which it finds trustworthy guides elsewhere in its discussion of the First Amendment.  See ante, at 822-823, 825, 827, 829-832.  Nor does the plurality explain why it places so much weight on Regan `s apparent departure from the no-supplanting rule while it ignores Regan `s core reasoning that the testing aid there was permissible because, in direct contrast to Levitt , the aid was not divertible.  [18]  I do not read the plurality to question the prohibition on substantial aid.  The plurality challenges any rule based on the proportion of aid that a program provides to religious recipients, citing Witters and Agostini .  See ante, at 812, n. 6.  I reject the plurality's reasoning.
**Combined Opinion**
 App. 105a108a, 184a185a.  The evidence shows that the concept of supplementing instead of supplanting was poorly understood by the sole government official administering the program, who apparently believed that the bar on supplanting was nothing more than a prohibition on paying for replacements of equipment that religious schools had previously purchased.  Id., at 167a.  Government officials admitted that there was no way to determine whether payments for materials, equipment, books, or other assistance provided under the program reduced the amount of money budgeted for library and educational equipment, id., at 145a146a, and the 1985 Monitoring Report shows that the officials of at least one religious school admitted that the government aid was used to create the library, with the school's regular funds, when occasionally available, used merely to supplement the government money, Fine Deposition, id., at 63a.  The use records for audiovisual materials at one religious high school revealed that Chapter 2 funds were essential to the school's educational process, id., at 187a, and a different school, as already noted, used a Chapter 2 computer to support its computer network when its own computers failed, id., at 77a.The record is sparse, but these incidents suggest that the constitutional and statutory prohibition on supplanting expenses may have been largely aspirational.  It seems that the program in Jefferson Parish violated the statute and ran afoul of the Constitution.  Cf. Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 783 ; Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 12</citedDecision> .  [29]  Indeed, one group of amici curiae, which consists of "religious and educational leaders from a broad range of both Eastern and Western religious traditions, and Methodist, Jewish and Seventh-day Adventist individuals" including "church administrators, administrators of religious elementary and secondary school systems; elementary and secondary school teachers at religious schools; and pastors and laity who serve on church school boards," identifies its members as having "broad experience teaching in and administering pervasively sectarian schools."

[30]  One of the respondents describes herself as a "life-long, committed member of the Roman Catholic Church" who "objects to the government providing benefits to her parish school" because "[s]he has seen the chilling effect such entangling government aid has on the religious mission of schools run by her church." Brief for Respondents 1.  She has been a member of the church for about 36 years, and six of her children attended different Jefferson Parish Catholic run schools.  <citedDecision>Id., at 1, n. 1</citedDecision> .  [31] E. g., Brief for Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs as Amicus Curiae; Brief for Interfaith Religious Liberty Foundation et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for National Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty et al. as Amici Curiae.  [32]  I do not think it worthwhile to comment at length, for example, on the plurality's clear misunderstanding of our access-to-public-forum cases, such as Lamb's Chapel and Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981), as "decisions that have prohibited governments from discriminating in the distribution of public benefits based on religious status or sincerity," ante, at 828, when they were decided on completely different and narrowly limited free-speech grounds.  Nor would it be worthwhile here to engage in extended discussion of why the goal of preventing courts from having to "trol[l] through a person's or institution's religious beliefs," ibid., calls for less aid and commingling of government with religion, not for tolerance of their effects.
