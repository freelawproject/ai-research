 The union subsequently filed with the Board an unfair labor practice charge against Hudgens, alleging interference.  with rights protected by § 7 of the Act, 29 *510 U. S. C. § 157 .  2 Relying on this Court’s decision in Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 , the Board entered a cease-and-desist order against Hudgens, reasoning that because the warehouse employees enjoyed a First Amendment right to picket on the shopping center property, the owner’s threat of arrest violated § 8 (a)(1) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (a)(1).  3 Hudgens filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  Soon thereafter this Court decided Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 , and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 , and the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of those two decisions.  The Board, in turn, remanded to an Administrative Law Judge, who made findings of fact, recommendations, and conclusions to the effect that Hudgens had committed an unfair labor practice by excluding the pickets.  *511 This result was ostensibly reached under the statutory criteria set forth in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., <citedDecision>351 U. S. 105</citedDecision> , a case which held that union organizers who seek to solicit for union membership may intrude on an employer’s private property if no alternative means exist for communicating with the employees.  But the Administrative Law Judge’s opinion also relied on this Court’s constitutional decision in Logan Valley for a “realistic view of the facts.” The Board agreed with the findings and recommendations of the Administrative Law Judge, but departed somewhat from his reasoning.  It concluded that the pickets were within the scope of Hudgens’ invitation to members of the public to do business at the shopping center, and that it was, therefore, immaterial whether or not there existed an alternative means of communicating with the customers and employees of the Butler store.  4 Hudgens again petitioned for review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and there the Board changed its tack and urged that the case was controlled not by Babcock & Wilcox, but by Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 , a case which held that an employer commits an unfair labor practice if he enforces a no-solicitation rule against employees on his premises who are also union organizers, unless he can prove that the rule is necessitated by special circumstances.  The Court of Appeals enforced the Board’s cease-and-desist order but on the basis of yet another theory.  While acknowledging that the source of the pickets’ rights was § 7 of the Act, the Court of Appeals held that the competing constitutional and property .right considerations discussed in Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, supra, “burde[n] the General Counsel with the duty to *512 prove that other locations less intrusive upon Hudgens’ property rights than picketing inside the mall were either unavailable or ineffective,” 501 F. 2d, at 169 , and that the Board’s General Counsel had met that burden in this case. In this Court the petitioner Hudgens continues to urge that Babcock & Wilcox Co. is the controlling precedent, and that under the criteria of that case the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.  The respondent union agrees that a statutory standard governs, but insists that, since the § 7 activity here was not organizational as in Babcock but picketing in support of a lawful economic strike, an appropriate accommodation of the competing interests must lead to an affirmance of the Court of Appeals’ judgment.

 8 For while a municipality may constitutionally impose reasonable time, place, and manner regulations on the use of its streets and sidewalks for First Amendment purposes, see Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 ; Poulos v. New Hampshire, 345 U. S. 395 , and may even forbid altogether such use of some of its facilities, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U. S. 39 ; what a municipality may not do under the First and Fourteenth Amendments is to discriminate in the regulation of expression on the basis of the content of that expression, Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205 .  “[A]bove all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 .  9 It conversely follows, therefore, that if the respondents in the Lloyd case did not have a First Amendment right to enter that shopping center to distribute handbills concerning Vietnam, then the pickets in the present case did not have a First Amendment *521 right to enter this shopping center for the purpose of advertising their strike against the Butler Shoe Co. We conclude, in short, that under the present state of the law the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no part to play in a case such as this.  Ill From what has been said it follows that the rights and liabilities of the parties in this case are dependent exclusively upon the National Labor Relations Act.  Under the Act the task of the Board, subject to review by the courts, is to resolve conflicts between § 7 rights and private property rights, “and to seek a proper accommodation between the two.” Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S., at 543.  What is “a proper accommodation” in any situation may largely depend upon the content and the context of the § 7 rights being asserted.  The task of the Board and the reviewing courts under the Act, therefore, stands in conspicuous contrast to the duty of a court in applying the standards of the First Amendment, which requires “above all else” that expression must not be restricted by government “because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” In the Central Hardware case, and earlier in the case of NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., <citedDecision>351 U. S. 105</citedDecision> , the Court considered the nature of the Board's task in this area under the Act.  Accommodation between employees’ § 7 rights and employers’ property rights, the Court said in Babcock & Wilcox, “must be obtained with as little destruction of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other.” <citedDecision>351 U. S., at 112</citedDecision> .  Both Central Hardware and Babcock & Wilcox involved organizational activity carried on by nonemploy-ees on the employers’ property.  10 The context of the § 7 *522 activity in the present case was different in several respects which may or may not be relevant in striking the proper balance.  First, it involved lawful economic strike activity rather than organizational activity.  See Steelworkers v. NLRB, 376 U. S. 492, 499 ; Bus Employees v. Missouri, 374 U. S. 74, 82 ; NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U. S. 221, 234 .  Cf. Houston Insulation Contractors Assn. v. NLRB, 386 U. S. 664, 668-669 .  Second, the § 7 activity here was carried on by Butler’s employees (albeit not employees of its shopping center store), not by outsiders.

 Mr. Justice White clearly recognized this principle in his Logan Valley dissenting opinion.  391 U. S., at 339 .  The Court has in the past held that some expression is not protected “speech” within the meaning of the First Amendment.  Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476 ; Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 .  A wholly different balance was struck when the organizational *522 activity was carried on by employees already rightfully on the employer’s property, since the employer’s management interests rather than his property interests were there involved.  Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 .  This difference is “one of substance.” NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., <citedDecision>351 U. S., at 113</citedDecision> .  This is not to say that Hudgens was not a statutory “employer” under the Act.  See n. 3, supra. <citedDecision>351 U. S., at 112</citedDecision> .  This language was explicitly reaffirmed as stating “the guiding principle” in Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539, 544 .


**Dissenting Opinion**
 As the Court indicates, the Board’s initial determination that petitioner violated §8 (a)(1) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (a)(1), was based on its reading of Logan Valley, a First Amendment case. But before the Court of Appeals reviewed this initial determination, this Court decided Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 (1972), and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 (1972), and the Board moved to have the case remanded for reconsideration in light of these two decisions.  The Court of Appeals granted the motion.  Lloyd and Central Hardware demonstrated, each in its own way, that Logan Valley could not be read as broadly as some Courts of Appeals had read it.  And together they gave a signal to the Board and to the Court of Appeals that it would be wise to pass upon statutory contentions in cases of this sort before turning to broad constitutional questions, the answers to which could no longer be predicted with certainty.  See Central Hardware, supra, at 548, 549 (Maeshall, J., dissenting); Lloyd, supra, at 584 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Taking heed of this signal, the Administrative Law Judge and the Board proceeded on remand to assess the conflicting rights of the employees and the shopping center owner within the framework of the NLRA.  The Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation that petitioner be found guilty of a § 8 (a)(1) violation rested explicitly on the statutory test enunciated by this Court in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., <citedDecision>351 U. S. 105</citedDecision> (1956).  That the Administrative Law Judge supported his “realistic view of the facts” by referring to this Court’s “factual view” of the Logan Valley case surely cannot be said to alter the judge’s explicitly stated legal theory, which was a statutory one.  *528 Even more clearly, the Board’s rationale in agreeing with the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation was exclusively a statutory one.  Nowhere in the Board’s decision, Hudgens v. Local SIS, Retail, Wholesale & Dept. Store Union, 205 N. L. R. B. 628 (1973), is there any reference to the First Amendment or any' constitutionally based decision.  The Board reached its result “for the reasons specifically set forth in Frank Vis-ceglia and Vincent Visceglia, t/a Peddie Buildings,” 1 ibid., a case decided solely on § 7 grounds.  In Visceglia the Board had specifically declined to treat the picketing area in question as the functional equivalent of a business block and rejected the applicability of Logan Valley’s First Amendment analysis, finding an interference with § 7 rights under a “modified” Babcock & Wilcox test.  2 When the Board in this case relied upon the rationale of Visceglia, it was evidently proceeding under the assumption that the First Amendment had no application.

 While that general concern is a legitimate one, it does not justify the constitutional adjudication undertaken by the Court. If it were undisputed that the pickets in this case enjoyed some degree of First Amendment protection against interference by petitioner, it might be difficult to separate a consideration of the scope of that First Amendment protection from an analysis of the scope of *532 protection afforded by § 7.  But the constitutional question that the Court decides today is whether the First Amendment operates to restrict petitioner’s actions in any way at all, and that question is clearly severable, at least initially, from a consideration of § 7’s scope — as proved by the Court’s remand of the case. Thus even if, as the Court suggests, the Court of Appeals’ view of § 7 was affected by the First Amendment, the Court still could have proceeded initially to decide the statutory question divorced of constitutional considerations.  I cannot understand the Court’s bypassing that purely statutory question to overrule a First Amendment decision less than 10 years old.  And I certainly cannot understand the Court’s remand of the purely statutory question to the Board, whose decision was so clearly unaffected by any constitutional considerations that the Court does not even suggest otherwise.  II On the merits of the purely statutory question that I believe is presented to the Court, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  To do so, one need not consider whether consumer picketing by employees is subject to a more permissive test under § 7 than the test articulated in Babcock & Wilcox for organizational activity by nonemployees.  In Babcock & Wilcox we stated that an employer “must allow the union to approach his employees on his property” 5 if the employees are “beyond the reach of reasonable efforts to communicate with them,” <citedDecision>351 U. S., at 113</citedDecision> — that is, if “other means” of communication are not “readily available.” <citedDecision>Id., at 114</citedDecision> .  Thus the general standard that emerges *533 from Babcock & Wilcox is the ready availability of reasonably effective alternative means of communication with the intended audience.  In Babcock & Wilcox itself, the intended audience was the employees of a particular employer, a limited identifiable group; and it was thought that such an audience could be reached effectively by means other than entrance onto the employer’s property — for example, personal contact at the employees’ living quarters, which were “in reasonable reach.” <citedDecision>Id., at 113</citedDecision> .  In this case, of course, the intended audience was different, and what constitutes reasonably effective alternative means of communication also differs.  As the Court of Appeals noted, the intended audience in this case “was only identifiable as part of the citizenry of greater Atlanta until it approached the store, and thus for the picketing to be effective, the location chosen was crucial unless the audience could be known and reached by other means.” 501 F. 2d, at 168 .  Petitioner contends that the employees could have utilized the newspapers, radio, television, direct mail, handbills, and billboards to reach the citizenry of Atlanta.  But none of those means is likely to be as effective as on-location picketing: the initial impact of communication by those means would likely be less dramatic, and the potential for dilution of impact significantly greater.  As this Court has observed: “Publication in a newspaper, or by distribution of circulars, may convey the same information or make the same charge as do those patrolling a picket line. But the very purpose of a picket line is to exert influences, and it produces consequences, different from other modes of communication.  The loyalties and responses evoked and exacted by picket lines are unlike those flowing from appeals by printed word.” Hughes v. Superior Court, 339 U. S. 460, 465 (1950).
**Dissenting Opinion**
 While the Board’s General Counsel thus did not rely on Babcock & Wilcox, the basis for the Board’s decision, he still relied on a statutory case, not a constitutional one.  Petitioner argued in the Court of Appeals that under Babcock & Wilcox the picketing could be prohibited unless it could be shown that there were no other available channels of communication with the intended audience.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals quite clearly viewed the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation and the Board’s decision as statutorily based.  And the court did not even make the factual finding of functional equivalence to a business district that it recognized as a prerequisite to the application of the First Amendment.  501 F. 2d, at 164 .  It is irrelevant, in my view, that the property in this case was owned by the shopping center owner rather than by the employer.  The nature of the property interest is the same in either case. The only alternative means of communication referred to in Babcock & Wilcox were “personal contacts on streets or at home, telephones, letters or advertised meetings to get in touch with the employees.” <citedDecision>351 U. S., at 111</citedDecision> .  No point would be served by adding to the observations in Logan Valley and my dissent in Lloyd with respect to the growth of suburban shopping centers and the proliferation of activities taking place in such centers.
