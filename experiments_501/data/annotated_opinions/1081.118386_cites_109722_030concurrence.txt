 In 1965, Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 79 Stat. 27 (1965 Act).  Under Title I, Congress provided monetary grants to States to address the needs of educationally deprived children of low-income families.  Under Title II, Congress provided further monetary *837 grants to States for the acquisition of library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials for use by children and teachers in public and private elementary and secondary schools.  Since 1965, Congress has reauthorized the Title I and Title II programs several times.  Three Terms ago, we held in Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997), that Title I, as applied in New York City, did not violate the Establishment Clause.  I believe that Agostini likewise controls the constitutional inquiry respecting Title II presented here, and requires the reversal of the Court of Appeals’ judgment that the program is unconstitutional as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.  To the extent our decisions in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 229</citedDecision> (1977), are inconsistent with the Court’s judgment today, I agree that those decisions should be overruled.  I therefore concur in the judgment.  I — I I write separately because, in my view, the plurality announces a rule of unprecedented breadth for the evaluation of Establishment Clause challenges to government school aid programs.  Reduced to its essentials, the plurality's rule states that government aid to religious schools does not have the effect of advancing religion so long as the aid is offered on a neutral basis and the aid is secular in content.  The plurality also rejects the distinction between direct and indirect aid, and holds that the actual diversion of secular aid by a religious school to the advancement of its religious mission is permissible.  Although the expansive scope of the plurality's rule is troubling, two specific aspects of the opinion compel me to write separately.  First, the plurality’s treatment of neutrality comes close to assigning that faetor singular importance in the future adjudication of Establishment Clause challenges to government school aid programs.

 Although respondents claim that Chapter 2 aid has been diverted to religious instruction, that evidence is de minimis, as I explain at greater length below.  See infra, at 864-867.  Respondents contend that Agostini is distinguishable, pointing to the distinct character of the aid program considered there.  See Brief for Respondents 44-47.  In Agostini , federal funds paid for public-school teachers to provide secular instruction to eligible children on the premises of their religious schools.  Here, in contrast, federal funds pay for instructional materials and equipment that LEA’s lend to religious schools for use by those schools’ own teachers in their classes.  Because we held similar programs unconstitutional in Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> , respondents contend that those decisions, and not Agostini , are controlling.  See, e. g., Brief for Respondents 11,22-25.  Like respondents, Justice Souter also relies on Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> in finding the character of the Chapter 2 aid constitutionally problematic.  See post, at 893, 903.  At the time they were decided, Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> created an inexplicable rift within our Establishment Clause jurisprudence concerning government aid to schools.  Seven years before our decision in Meek , we held in Allen that a New York statute that authorized the lending of textbooks to students attending religious schools did not violate the *850 Establishment Clause.  392 U. S., at 238 .  We explained that the statute “merely [made] available to all children the benefits of a general program to lend school boohs free of charge,” that the State retained ownership of the textbooks, and that religious schools received no financial benefit from the program.  Id., at 243-244 .  We specifically rejected the contrary argument that the statute violated the Establishment Clause because textbooks are critical to the teaching process, which in a religious school is employed to inculcate religion.  Id., at 245-248 .  In Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> , we adhered to Allen, holding that the textbook lending programs at issue in each case did not violate the Establishment Clause.  See Meek, 421 U. S., at 359-362 (plurality opinion); Wolman, <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 236-238</citedDecision> (plurality opinion).  At the same time, however, we held in both eases that the lending of instructional materials and equipment to religious schools was unconstitutional.  See Meek, supra, at 362-366 ; <citedDecision>Wolman, supra, at 248-251</citedDecision> .  We reasoned that, because the religious schools receiving the materials and equipment were pervasively sectarian, any assistance in support of the schools’ educational missions would inevitably have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  For example, in Meek we explained: “[I]t would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania’s church-related elementary and secondary schools and to then characterize [the statute] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.  Even though earmarked for secular purposes, 'when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission,’ state aid has the impermissible primary effect of advancing religion.” 421 U. S., at 365 -366 (quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 743 (1973)).  *851 Thus, we held that the aid program “necessarily results in aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole,” and “inescapably results in the direct and substantial advancement of religious activity.” Meek, supra, at 366 (emphases added).  Similarly, in <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> , we concluded that, “[i]n view of the impossibility of separating the secular education function from the sectarian, the state aid inevitably flows in part in support of the religious role of the schools.” <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 250</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  For whatever reason, the Court was not willing to extend this presumption of inevitable religious indoctrination to school aid when it instead consisted of textbooks lent free of charge.  For example, in Meek , despite identifying the religious schools’ secular educational functions and religious missions as inextricably intertwined, 421 U. S., at 366 , the Court upheld the textbook lending program because “the record in the case ..., like the record in Allen, contains no suggestion that religious textbooks will be lent or that the books provided will be used for anything other than purely secular purposes,” id., at 361-362 (citation omitted).  Accordingly, while the Court was willing to apply an irrebutta-ble presumption that secular instructional materials and equipment would be diverted to use for religious indoctrination, it required evidence that religious schools were diverting secular textbooks to religious instruction.  The inconsistency between the two strands of the Court’s jurisprudence did not go unnoticed, as Justices on both sides of the Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> decisions relied on the contradiction to support their respective arguments.  See, e. g., Meek, 421 U. S., at 384 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[W]hat the Court says of the instructional materials and equipment may be said perhaps even more accurately of the textbooks” (citation omitted)); id., at 390 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (“The failure of the majority to justify the differing approaches to textbooks and instructional materials and *852 equipment in the above respect is symptomatic of its failure even to attempt to distinguish the... textbook loan program, which the plurality upholds, from the... instructional materials and equipment loan program, which the majority finds unconstitutional”).  The irrationality of this distinction is patent.  As one Member of our Court has noted, it has meant that “a State may lend to parochial school children geography textbooks that contain maps of the United States, but the State may not lend maps of the United States for use in geography class.” Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 110 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (footnotes omitted).  Indeed, technology’s advance since the Allen, Meek, and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> decisions has only made the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment more suspect.  In this case, for example, we are asked to draw a constitutional line between lending textbooks and lending computers.  Because computers constitute instructional equipment, adherence to Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> would require the exclusion of computers from any government school aid program that includes religious schools.  Yet, computers are now as necessary as were schoolbooks 30 years ago, and they play a somewhat similar role in the educational process.  That Allen, Meek, and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> would permit the constitutionality of a school aid program to turn on whether the aid took the form of a computer rather than a book further reveals the inconsistency inherent in their logic.  Respondents insist that there is a reasoned basis under the Establishment Clause for the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment.  They claim that the presumption that religious schools will use instructional materials and equipment to inculcate religion is sound because such materials and equipment, unlike textbooks, are reasonably divertible to religious uses.  For example, no matter what secular criteria the government employs in selecting a film projector to lend to a religious school, school officials can always divert that projector to re *853 ligious instruction.  Respondents therefore claim that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from giving or lending aid to religious schools when that aid is reasonably divertible to religious uses.  See, e. g., Brief for Respondents 11,35.  Justice Souter also states that the divertibility of secular government aid is an important consideration under the Establishment Clause, although he apparently would not ascribe it the constitutionally determinative status that respondents do.  See post, at 885, 890-895.  I would reject respondents’ proposed divertibility rule.  First, respondents cite no precedent of this Court that would require it.  The only possible direct precedential support for such a rule is a single sentence contained in a footnote from our <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> decision.  There, the Court described Allen as having been “premised on the view that the educational content of textbooks is something that can be ascertained in advance and cannot be diverted to sectarian uses.” Wol-man, supra, at 251, n. 18.  To the extent this simple description of Allen is even correct, it certainly does not constitute an actual holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from lending any divertible aid to religious schools.  Rather, as explained above, the <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> Court based its holding invalidating the lending of instructional materials and equipment to religious schools on the rationale adopted in Meek — that the secular educational function of a religious school is inseparable from its religious mission.  See Wolman, <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 250</citedDecision> .  Indeed, if anything, the Wol-man footnote confirms the irrationality of the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment.  After the <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> Court acknowledged that its holding with respect to instructional materials and equipment was in tension with Allen, the Court explained the continuing validity of Allen solely on the basis of stare decisis: “Board of Education v. Allen has remained law, and we now follow as a matter of stare decisis the principle that restriction of textbooks to those provided the public schools is sufficient to ensure *854 that the books will not be used for religious purposes.” <citedDecision>Wolman, supra, at 252, n. 18</citedDecision> .  Thus, the <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> Court never justified the inconsistent treatment it accorded the lending of textbooks and the lending of instructional materials and equipment based on the items’ reasonable divertibility.  Justice Souter’s attempt to defend the divertibility rationale as a viable distinction in our Establishment Clause jurisprudence fares no better.  For Justice Souter, secular school aid presents constitutional problems not only when it is actually diverted to religious ends, but also when it simply has the capacity for, or presents the possibility of, such diversion.  See, e. g., post, at 893 (discussing “susceptibility [of secular supplies] to the service of religious ends”).  Thus, he explains the Allen, Meek, and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> decisions as follows: “While the textbooks had a known and fixed secular content not readily divertible to religious teaching purposes, the adaptable materials did not.” Post, at 893-894.  This view would have come as a surprise to the Court in Meek , which expressly conceded that “the material and equipment that are the subjects of the loan .  .  .  are ‘self-poliefing], in that starting as secular, nonideological and neutral, they will not change in use.’” 421 U. S., at 365 (quoting Meek v. Pit-tenger, 374 F. Supp. 639, 660 (ED Pa. 1974)).  Indeed, given the nature of the instructional materials considered in Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> , it is difficult to comprehend how a divertibility rationale could have explained the decisions.  The statutes at issue in those cases authorized the lending of “periodicals, photographs, maps, charts, sound recordings, [and] films,” Meek, supra, at 355, and “maps and globes,” <citedDecision>Wolman, supra, at 249</citedDecision> .  There is no plausible basis for saying that these items are somehow more divertible than a textbook given that each of the above items, like a textbook, has a fixed and ascertainable content.  In any event, even if Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> had articulated the divertibility rationale urged by respondents and Justice *855 Souter, I would still reject it for a more fundamental reason.  Stated simply, the theory does not provide a logical distinction between the lending of textbooks and the lending of instructional materials and equipment.  An educator can use virtually any instructional tool, whether it has ascertainable content or not, to teach a religious message.  In this respect, I agree with the plurality that “it is hard to imagine any book that could not, in even moderately skilled hands, serve to illustrate a religious message.” Ante, at 828.  In today’s case, for example, we are asked to draw a constitutional distinction between lending a textbook and lending a library book. Justice Souter’s try at justifying that distinction only demonstrates the absurdity on which such a difference must rest. He states that “[although library books, like textbooks, have fixed content, religious teachers can assign secular library books for religious critique.” Post, at 903.  Regardless of whether that explanation is even correct (for a student surely could be given a religious assignment in connection with a textbook too), it is hardly a distinction on which constitutional law should turn.  Moreover, if the mere ability of a teacher to devise a religious lesson involving the secular aid in question suffices to hold the provision of that aid unconstitutional, it is difficult to discern any limiting principle to the divertibility rule.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 See post, at 890-893.  It does not follow, however, that we should treat as eonstitu- *856 tionally suspect any form of secular aid that might conceivably be diverted to a religious use.  As the cases Justice Souter cites demonstrate, our concern with direct monetary aid is based on more than just diversion.  In fact, the most important reason for according special treatment to direct money grants is that this form of aid falls precariously close to the original object of the Establishment Clause's prohibition.  See, e. g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 668 (1970) (“[F]or the men who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment the ‘establishment’ of a religion connoted sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity”).  Statements concerning the constitutionally suspect status of direct cash aid, accordingly, provide no justification for applying an absolute rule against divertibility when the aid consists instead of instructional materials and equipment.  Justice Souter also relies on our decisions in <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> (to the extent it concerned field-trip transportation for nonpublic schools), Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472 (1973), Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672 (1971), and Bowen .  See post, at 893-895.  None requires application of a divertibility rule in the context of this case. <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> and Levitt were both based on the same presumption that government aid will be used in the inculcation of religion that we have chosen not to apply to textbook lending programs and that we have more generally rejected in recent decisions.  Compare Wolman, <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 254</citedDecision> ; Levitt, supra, at 480 , with supra, at 851-852; infra, at 859.  In Tilton , we considered a federal statute that authorized grants to universities for the construction of buildings and facilities to be used exclusively for secular educational purposes.  See 403 U. S., at 674-675 .  We held the statute unconstitutional only to the extent that a university’s “obligation not to use the facility for sectarian instruction or religious worship .  .  .  appeared] to expire at the end of 20 years.” Id., at 683 .
**Concurrence Opinion**
 Finally, our decision in Bowen proves only that actual diversion, as opposed to mere divertibility, is constitutionally impermissible.  See, e. g., 487 U. S., at 621 .  Had we believed that the divertibility of secular aid was sufficient to call the aid program into question, there would have been no need for the remand we ordered and no basis for the reversal.  IV Because divertibility fails to explain the distinction our cases have drawn between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment, there remains the question of which of the two irreconcilable strands of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence we should now follow.  Between the two, I would adhere to the rule that we have applied in the context of textbook lending programs: To establish a First Amendment violation, plaintiffs must prove that the aid in question actually is, or has been, used for religious purposes.  See Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362 ; Allen, 392 U. S., at 248 .  Just as we held in Agostini that our more recent cases had undermined the assumptions underlying Ball and Aguilar , I would now hold that Agostini and the eases on which it relied have undermined the assumptions underlying Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> .  To be sure, Agostini only addressed the specific presumption that public-school employees teaching on the premises of religious schools would inevitably inculcate religion.  Nevertheless, I believe that our definitive rejection of that presumption also stood for — or at least strongly *858 pointed to — the broader proposition that such presumptions of religious indoctrination are normally inappropriate when evaluating neutral school aid programs under the Establishment Clause.  In Agostini , we repeatedly emphasized that it would be inappropriate to presume inculcation of religion; rather, plaintiffs raising an Establishment Clause challenge must present evidence that the government aid in question has resulted in religious indoctrination.  See 521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-227 .  We specifically relied on our statement in Zobrest that a presumption of indoctrination, because it constitutes an absolute bar to the aid in question regardless of the religious school’s ability to separate that aid from its religious mission, constitutes a "flat rule, smacking of antiquated notions of ‘taint,’ [that] would indeed exalt form over substance.” 509 U. S., at 13 .  That reasoning applies with equal force to the presumption in Meek and Ball concerning instructional materials and equipment.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 Under that program, the government paid religious school teachers to operate as part-time public teachers at their religious schools by teaching secular classes at the conclusion of the regular sehoolday.  Ball, 478 U. S., at 376-377.  Relying on both the majority opinion and my separate opinion in Ball , respondents therefore contend that we must presume that religious school teachers will inculcate religion in their students.  If that is so, they argue, we must also presume that religious school teachers will be unable to follow secular restrictions on the use of instructional materials and equipment lent to their schools by the government.  See Brief for Respondents 26-29.  I disagree, however, that the latter proposition follows from the former.  First, as our holding in Allen and its reaf-firmance in Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> demonstrate, the Court’s willingness to assume that religious school instructors will inculcate religion has not caused us to presume also that such instructors will be unable to follow secular restrictions on the use of textbooks.  I would similarly reject any such presumption regarding the use of instructional materials and equipment.  When a religious school receives textbooks or instructional materials and equipment lent with secular restrictions, the school’s teachers need not refrain from teaching religion altogether.  Rather, the instructors need only ensure that any such religious teaching is done without the instructional aids provided by the government.  We have always been willing to assume that religious school instructors can abide by such restrictions when the aid consists of textbooks, which Justice Brennan described as “surely the heart tools of.. .  education.” Meek, supra, at 384 (concurring in. part and dissenting in part).  The same assumption should extend to instructional materials and equipment.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 I disagree with both the plurality and Justice Souter.  The limited evidence amassed by respondents during 4 years of discovery (which began approximately 15 years ago) is at best de minimis and therefore insufficient to affect the constitutional inquiry.  The plurality and Justice Souter direct the primary thrust of their arguments at the alleged inadequacy of the program’s safeguards.  Respondents, the plurality, and Justice Souter all appear to proceed from the premise that, so long as actual diversion presents a constitutional problem, the government must have a failsafe mechanism capable of detecting any instance of diversion.  We rejected that very assumption, however, in Agostini .  There, we explained that because we had “abandoned the assumption that properly instructed public employees will fail to discharge their duties faithfully, we must also discard the assumption that pervasive monitoring of Title I teachers is required.” 521 U. S., at 234 (emphasis in original).  Because I believe that the Court should abandon the presumption adopted in Meek and <citedDecision>Wolman</citedDecision> respecting the use of instructional materials and equipment by religious school teachers, I see no constitutional need for pervasive monitoring under the Chapter 2 program.  The safeguards employed by the program are constitutionally sufficient.  At the federal level, the statute limits aid to “secular, neutral, and nonideological services, materials, and equipment,” 20 U. S. C. § 7372 (a)(1); requires that the aid only supplement and not supplant funds from non-Federal sources, § 7371(b); and prohibits “any payment... for religious worship or instruction,” § 8897.  At the state level, the Louisiana Department of Education (the relevant SEA for *862 Louisiana) requires all nonpublie schools to submit signed assurances that they will use Chapter 2 aid only to supplement and not to supplant non-Federal funds, and that the instructional materials and equipment “will only be used for secular, neutral and nonideological purposes.” App. 260a-261a; see also id., at 120a.  Although there is some dispute concerning the mandatory nature of these assurances, Dan Lewis, the director of Louisiana’s Chapter 2 program, testified that all of the State’s nonpublic schools had thus far been willing to sign the assurances, and that the State retained the power to cut off aid to any school that breached an assurance.  Id., at 122a-123a.  The Louisiana SEA also conducts monitoring visits to each of the State’s LEA’s — and one or two of the nonpublie schools covered by the relevant LEA— once every three years.
