<author id="b256-8">Mr. Justice Stewart,</author>
<p id="Aa2">concurring in part.</p>
<p id="b256-9">For the reasons convincingly set forth in the dissenting opinion of The Chief Justice, I agree with him that a three-judge court should not have been convened in this case, and that consequently this appeal is not properly before us. I would therefore dismiss the appeal. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Whittier, </em>365 U. S. 465. The Court, however, holds that this appeal is properly here, and on the merits of the litigation I agree with the Courtâ€™s conclusion.</p>
