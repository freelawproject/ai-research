**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Clark, with whom Mr. Justice Burton joins, dissenting.  The Court today releases two women from prosecution though the evidence shows that they brutally killed their husbands, both American soldiers, while stationed with them in quarters furnished by our armed forces on its military installations in foreign lands.  In turning these women free, it declares unconstitutional an important section of an Act of Congress governing our armed forces.  Furthermore, four of my brothers would specifically overrule and two would impair the long-recognized vitality of an old and respected precedent in our law, the case of In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> (1891), cited by this Court with approval in many opinions and as late as 1929 by a unanimous Court 1 in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 451 .  And, finally, the Court reverses, sets aside, and overrules two majority opinions and judgments of this Court in these same cases, reported in 351.U.  S., at 470 and 487, and entered on June 11,1956, less than 12 months ago.  In substitute therefor it enters no opinion whatever for the Court. It is unable to muster a majority.  Instead, there are handed down three opinions.  But, worst of all, it gives no authoritative guidance as to what, if anything, the Executive or the Congress may do to remedy the distressing situation in which they now find themselves.  *79 MR. Justice Burton and I remain convinced that the former opinions of the Court are correct and that they set forth valid constitutional doctrine under the long-recognized cases of this Court. The opinions were neither written nor agreed to in haste and they reflect the consensus of the majority reached after thorough discussion at many conferences.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Upon attack by an enemy they would be so treated; all foreign governments so recognized them at all times; and, in addition, it has been clearly shown, unlike in Toth, that “the discipline of the Army is going to be disrupted, its morale impaired, or its orderly processes disturbed” by excluding them from the provisions of the Uniform Code. Every single one of our major military commanders over the world has filed a statement to this effect in this case. We should not substitute our views as to this necessity for the views of those charged with the responsibility of the protection of such far-flung outposts of the free world.  The former minority, however, repudiates this underlying basis of the opinion in Toth, namely, that where disciplinary measures are necessary to the regulation of the armed forces the Congress does have constitutional power to make rules.  In my opinion the rules it has made are necessary to the regulation of the land and naval forces and the means chosen, the Uniform Code, is in no way an unreasonable one.  There remains the further consideration of whether this provision is “ ‘the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.’ ” United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, supra, at 23 .  This is the strict standard by which we determine the scope of constitutional power of Congress to authorize trial by court-martial.  A study of the problem clearly indicates that the use of the Uniform Code of Military Justice was really the only practicable alternative available.  While it was conceded before this Court that Congress could have established a system of territorial or consular *87 courts to try offenses committed by civilian .dependents abroad, the action of four of my brothers who would overrule and two who would impair the vitality of In re <citedDecision>Ross, supra,</citedDecision> places this alternative in jeopardy.  Territorial courts have been used by our Government for over a century and have always received the sanction of this Court until today.  However, in the light of all of the opinions of the former minority here, the use of a system of territorial or consular courts is now out of the question.  Moreover, Congress probably had concluded to abandon this system before the Uniform Code was adopted, since a short time thereafter the jurisdiction of the last of our territorial or consular courts was terminated.  70 Stat. 773 .  Another alternative the Congress might have adopted was the establishment of federal courts pursuant to Article III of the Constitution.  These constitutional courts would have to sit in each of the 63 foreign countries where American troops are stationed at the present time.
