 .  .” People v. Cohan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445 , 282 P. 2d 905, 911 (1955).  In connection with this California case, we note that the second basis elaborated in Wolf in support of its failure to enforce the exclusionary doctrine against the States was that “other means of protection” have been afforded “the *652 right to privacy.” 7 338 U. S., at 30 .  The experience of California that such other remedies have been worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other States.  The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been *653 recognized by this Court since Wolf .  See Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 137 (1954).  Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the “weighty testimony” of People v. Defore, <citedDecision>242 N. Y. 13</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>150 N. E. 585</citedDecision> (1926).  There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the Weeks exclusionary rule in New York, had said that “[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax.” <citedDecision>242 N. Y., at 22</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>150 N. E., at 588</citedDecision> .  However, the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court. These include the recent discarding of the “silver platter” doctrine which allowed federal judicial use.  of evidence seized in violation of the Constitution by state agents, Elkins v. United States, supra; the relaxation of the formerly strict requirements as to standing to challenge the use of evidence thus seized, so that now the procedure of exclusion, “ultimately referable to constitutional safeguards;” is available to anyone even “legitimately on [the] premises” unlawfully searched, Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, 266-267 (1960); and, finally, the formulation of a method to prevent state use of evidence unconstitutionally seized by federal agents, Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 (1956).  Because there can be no fixed formula, we are admittedly met with “recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches,” but less is not to be expected when dealing with a Constitution, and, at any rate, “ [r] easonableness is in the first instance for the [trial court] ... to determine.” United States v. Rabinowits, 339 U. S. 56, 63 (1950).  It, therefore, plainly appears that the factual considerations supporting the failure of the Wolf Court to include the Weeks exclusionary rule when it recognized the enforceability of the right to privacy against the States in 1949, while not basically relevant to the constitutional consideration, could not, in any analysis, now be deemed controlling.  *654 III. Some five years after Wolf , in answer to a plea made here Term after Term that we overturn its doctrine on applicability of the Weeks exclusionary rule, this Court indicated that such should not be done until the States had “adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the [Weeks] rule.” Irvine v. California, supra, at 134 .  There again it was said: “Never until June of 1949 did this Court hold the basic search-and-seizure prohibition in any way applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Ibid. And only last Term, after again carefully re-examining the Wolf doctrine in Elkins v. United States, supra, the Court pointed out that “the controlling principles” as to search and seizure and the problem of admissibility “seemed clear” (at p. 212) until the announcement in Wolf “that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not itself require state courts to adopt the exclusionary rule” of the Weeks case. At p. 213.

 If the fruits of an unconstitutional search had been inadmissible in both state and federal courts, this inducement to evasion would have been sooner eliminated.  There would be no need to reconcile such cases as Rea and Schnettler , each pointing up the hazardous uncertainties of our heretofore ambivalent approach.  Federal-state cooperation in the solution of crime under constitutional standards will be promoted, if only by recognition of their now mutual obligation to respect the same fundamental criteria in their approaches.  “However much in a particular case insistence upon such rules may appear as a technicality that inures to the benefit of a guilty person, the history of the criminal law proves that tolerance of shortcut methods in law enforcement impairs its enduring effectiveness.” Miller v. United States, 357 U. S. 301, 313 (1958).  Denying shortcuts to only one of two cooperating law enforcement agencies tends naturally to breed legitimate suspicion of “working arrangements” whose results are equally tainted.  Byars v. United States, 273 U. S. 28 (1927); Lustig v. United States, 338 U. S. 74 (1949).  *659 There are those who say, as did Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, that under our constitutional exclusionary doctrine “[t]he criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.” People v. Defore, <citedDecision>242 N. Y., at 21</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>150 N. E., at 587</citedDecision> , In some cases this will undoubtedly be the result.  9 But, as was said in Elkins , “there is another consideration — the imperative of judicial integrity.” 364 U. S., at 222 .  The criminal goes free, if he must, but it is the law that sets him free. Nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the chartei of its own existence.  As Mr. Justice Brandéis, dissenting, said in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 485 (1928): “Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.  ... If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.” Nor can it lightly be assumed that, as a practical matter, adoption of the exclusionary rule fetters law enforcement.  Only last year this Court expressly considered that contention and found that “pragmatic evidence of a sort” to the contrary was not wanting.
