<author id="b135-5">Me. Justice Douglas</author>
<p id="Afr">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b135-6">Respondents were indicted and convicted for using, and conspiring to use, the mails to defraud. § 215 Criminal Code, IS U. S. C. § 338; § 37 Criminal Code, 18 U. S. C. § 88. The indictment was in twelve counts. It charged a scheme to defraud by organizing and promoting the I Am movement through the use of the mails. The charge was that certain designated corporations were formed, literature distributed and sold, funds solicited, and memberships in the I Am movement sought “by means of false and fraudulent representations, pretenses and promises.” The false representations charged were eighteen in number. It is sufficient at this point to say that they covered respondents’ alleged religious doctrines or beliefs. They were all set forth in the first count. The following are representative:</p>
<blockquote id="b135-7">that Guy W. Ballard, now deceased, alias Saint Ger-main, Jesus, George Washington, and Godfre Ray King, had been selected and thereby designated by the alleged “ascertained masters,” Saint Germain, as a divine messenger; and that the words of “ascended masters” and the words of the alleged divine entity, Saint Germain, would be transmitted to mankind through the medium of the said Guy W. Ballard;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b135-8">that Guy W. Ballard, during his lifetime, and Edna W. Ballard, and Donald Ballard, by reason of their alleged high spiritual attainments and righteous conduct, had been selected as divine messengers through which the words of the alleged “ascended masters,” in-<page-number citation-index="1" label="80">*80</page-number>eluding the alleged Saint Germain, would be communicated to mankind under the teachings commonly known as the “I Am” movement; that Guy W. Ballard, during his lifetime, and Edna W. Ballard and Donald Ballard had, by reason of supernatural attainments, the power to heal persons of ailments and diseases and to make well persons afflicted with any diseases, injuries, or ailments, and did falsely represent to persons intended to be defrauded that the three designated persons had the ability and power to cure persons of those diseases normally classified as curable and also of diseases which are ordinarily classified by the medical profession as being incurable diseases; and did further represent that the three designated persons had in fact cured either by the activity of one, either, or all of said persons, hundreds of persons afflicted with diseases and ailments;</blockquote>
<p id="b136-6">Each of the representations enumerated in the indictment was followed by the charge that respondents “well knew” it was false. After enumerating the eighteen misrepresentations the indictment also alleged:</p>
<blockquote id="b136-7">At the time of making all of the afore-alleged representations by the defendants, and each of them, the defendants, and each of them, well knew that all of said aforementioned representations were false and untrue and were made with the intention on the part of the defendants, and each of them, to cheat, wrong, and defraud persons intended to be defrauded, and to obtain from persons intended to be defrauded by the defendants, money, property, and other things of value and to convert the same to the use and the benefit of the defendants, and each of them;</blockquote>
<p id="b136-8">The indictment contained twelve counts, one of which charged a conspiracy to defraud. The first count set forth all of the eighteen representations, as we have said. Each of the other counts incorporated and realleged all of them and added no additional ones. There was a demurrer and a motion to quash, each of which asserted, among other things, that the indictment attacked the religious beliefs <page-number citation-index="1" label="81">*81</page-number>of respondents and sought to restrict the free exercise of their religion in violation of the Constitution of the United States. These motions were denied by the District Court. Early in the trial, however, objections were raised to the admission of certain evidence concerning respondents’ religious beliefs. The court conferred with counsel in absence of the jury and with the acquiescence of counsel for the United States and for respondents confined the issues on this phase of the case to the question of the good faith of respondents. At the request of counsel for both sides the court advised the jury of that action in the following language:</p>
<blockquote id="b137-6">Now, gentlemen, here is the issue in this case:</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b137-7">First, the defendants in this case made certain representations of belief in a divinity and in a supernatural power. Some of the teachings of the defendants, representations, might seem extremely improbable to a great many people. For instance, the appearance of Jesus to dictate some of the works that we have had introduced in evidence, as testified to here at the opening transcription, or shaking hands with Jesus, to some people that might seem highly improbable. I point that out as one of the many statements.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b137-8">Whether that is true or not is not the concern of this Court and is not the concern of the jury — and they are going to be told so in their instructions. As far as this Court sees the issue, it is immaterial what these defendants preached or wrote or taught in their classes. They are not going to be permitted to speculate on the actuality of the happening of those incidents. Now, I think I have made that as clear as I can. Therefore, the religious beliefs of these defendants cannot be an issue in this court.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b137-9">The issue is: Did these defendants honestly and in good faith believe those things? If they did, they should be acquitted. I cannot make it any clearer than that.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b137-10">If these defendants did not believe those things, they did not believe that Jesus came down and die-<page-number citation-index="1" label="82">*82</page-number>tated, or that Saint Germain came down and dictated, did not believe the things that they wrote, the things that they preached, but used the mail for the purpose of getting money, the jury should find them guilty. Therefore, gentlemen, religion cannot come into this case.</blockquote>
<p id="b138-6">The District Court reiterated that admonition in the charge to the jury and made it abundantly clear. The following portion of the charge is typical:</p>
<blockquote id="b138-7">The question of the defendants’ good faith is the cardinal question in this case. You are not to be concerned with the religious belief of the defendants, or any of them. The jury will be called upon to pass on the question of whether or not the defendants honestly and in good faith believed the representations which are set forth in the indictment, and honestly and in good faith believed that the benefits which they represented would flow from their belief to those who embraced and followed their teachings, or whether these representations were mere pretenses without honest belief on the part of the defendants or any of them, and, were the representations made for the purpose of procuring money, and were the mails used for this purpose.</blockquote>
<p id="b138-8">As we have said, counsel for the defense acquiesced in this treatment of the matter, made no objection to it during the trial, and indeed treated it without protest as the law of the case throughout the proceedings prior to the verdict. Respondents did not change their position before the District Court after verdict and contend that the truth or verity of their religious doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury. In their motion for new trial they did contend, however, that the withdrawal of these issues from the jury was error because it was in effect an amendment of the indictment. That was also one of their specifications of errors on appeal. And other errors urged on appeal included the overruling of the demurrer to the indictment and the motion to quash, and the <page-number citation-index="1" label="83">*83</page-number>disallowance of proof of the truth of respondents’ religious doctrines or beliefs.</p>
<p id="b139-5">The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of conviction and granted a new trial, one judge dissenting. 138 E. 2d 540. In its view the restriction of the issue in question to that of good faith was error. Its reason was that the scheme to defraud alleged in the indictment was that respondents made the eighteen alleged false representations; and that to prove that defendants devised the scheme described in the indictment “it was necessary to prove that they schemed to make some, at least, of the (eighteen) representations . . . and that some, at least, of the representations which they schemed to make were false.” 138 F. 2d 545. One judge thought that the ruling of the District Court was also error because it was “as prejudicial to the issue of honest belief as to the issue of purposeful misrepresentation.” <em>Id., </em>p. 546.</p>
<p id="b139-6">The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the importance of the question presented.</p>
<p id="b139-7">The United States contends that the District Court withdrew from the jury’s consideration only the truth or falsity of those representations which related to religious concepts or beliefs and that there were representations charged in the indictment which fell within a different category.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The argument is that this latter group of <page-number citation-index="1" label="84">*84</page-number>representations was submitted to the jury, that they were adequate to constitute an offense under the Act, and that they were supported by the requisite evidence. It is thus sought to bring the case within the rule of <em>Hall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>168 U. S. 632, 639-640, which held that where an indictment contained “all the necessary averments to constitute an offense created by the statute,” a conviction would not be set aside because a “totally immaterial fact” was averred but not proved. We do not stop to ascertain the relevancy of that rule to this case, for we are of the view that all of the representations charged in the indictment which related at least in part to the religious doctrines or beliefs of respondents were withheld from the jury. The trial judge did not differentiate them. He referred in the charge to the “religious beliefs” and “doctrines taught by the defendants” as matters withheld from the jury. And in stating that the issue of good faith was the “cardinal question” in the case he charged, as already noted, that “The jury will be called upon to pass on the question of whether or not the defendants honestly and in good faith believed the representations which are set forth in the indictment.” Nowhere in the charge were any of the separate representations submitted to the jury. A careful reading of the whole charge leads us to agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals on this phase of the case that the only issue submitted to the jury was the question as stated by the District Court, of respondents’ “belief in their representations and promises.”</p>
<p id="b140-6">The United States contends that respondents acquiesced in the withdrawal from the jury of the truth of their reli<page-number citation-index="1" label="85">*85</page-number>gious doctrines or beliefs and that their consent bars them from insisting on a different course once that one turned out to be unsuccessful. Reliance for that position is sought in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>318 U. S. 189. That case stands for the proposition that, apart from situations involving an unfair trial, an appellate court will not grant a new trial to a defendant on the ground of improper introduction of evidence or improper comment by the prosecutor, where the defendant acquiesced in that course and made no objection to it. In fairness to respondents that principle cannot be applied here. The real ob jection of respondents is not that the truth of their religious doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury. Their demurrer and motion to quash made clear their position that that issue should be withheld from the jury on the basis of the First Amendment. Moreover, their position at all times was and still is that the court should have gone the whole way and withheld from the jury both that issue and the issue of their good faith. Their demurrer and motion to quash asked for dismissal of the entire indictment. Their argument that the truth of their religious doctrines or beliefs should have gone to the jury when the question of their good faith was submitted was and is merely an alternative argument. They never forsook their position that the indictment should have been dismissed and that none of it was good. Moreover, respondents’ motion for new trial challenged the propriety of the action of the District Court in withdrawing from the jury the issue of the truth of their religious doctrines or beliefs without also withdrawing the question of their good faith. So we conclude that the rule of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>does not prevent respondents from reasserting now that no part of the indictment should have been submitted to the jury.</p>
<p id="b141-6">As we have noted, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the question of the truth of the representations concerning <page-number citation-index="1" label="86">*86</page-number>respondents’ religious doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury. And it remanded the case for a new trial. It may be that the Circuit Court of Appeals took that action because it did not think that the indictment could be properly construed as charging a scheme to defraud by means other than misrepresentations of respondents’ religious doctrines or beliefs. Or that court may have concluded that the withdrawal of the issue of the truth of those religious doctrines or beliefs was unwarranted because it resulted in a substantial change in the character of the crime charged. But on whichever basis that court rested its action, we do not agree that the truth or verity of respondents’ religious doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury. Whatever this particular indictment might require, the First Amendment precludes such a course, as the United States seems to concede. “The law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establishment of no sect.” <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>13 Wall. 679, 728. The First Amendment has a dual aspect. It not only “forestalls compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the practice of any form of worship” but also “safeguards the free exercise of the chosen form of religion.” <em>Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>310 U. S. 296, 303. “Thus the Amendment embraces two concepts, — freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be.” <em>Id., </em>pp. 303-304. Freedom of thought, which includes freedom of religious belief, is basic in a society of free men. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Barnette, </em>319 U. S. 624. It embraces the right to maintain theories of life and of death and of the hereafter which are rank heresy to followers of the orthodox faiths. Heresy trials are foreign to our Constitution. Men may believe what they cannot prove. They may not be put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs. Religious experiences which are as real as life to some may be incomprehensible to others. <page-number citation-index="1" label="87">*87</page-number>Yet the fact that they may be beyond the ken of mortals does not mean that they can be made suspect before the law. Many take their gospel from the New Testament. But it would hardly be supposed that they could be tried before a jury charged with the duty of determining whether those teachings contained false representations. The miracles of the New Testament, the Divinity of Christ, life after death, the power of prayer are deep in the religious convictions of many. If one could be sent to jail because a jury in a hostile environment found those teachings false, little indeed would be left of religious freedom. The Fathers of the Constitution were not unaware of the varied and extreme views of religious sects, of the violence of disagreement among them, and of the lack of any one religious creed on which all men would agree. They fashioned a charter of government which envisaged the widest possible toleration of conflicting views. Man’s relation to his God was made no concern of the state. He was granted the right to worship as he pleased and to answer to no man for the verity of his religious views. The religious views espoused by respondents might seem incredible, if not preposterous, to most people. But if those doctrines are subject to trial before a jury charged with finding their truth or falsity, then the same can be done with the religious beliefs of any sect. When the triers of fact undertake that task, they enter a forbidden domain. The First Amendment does not select any one group or any one type of religion for preferred treatment. It puts them all in that position. <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>319 U. S. 105. As stated in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Beason, </em>133 U. S. 333, 342, “With man’s relations to his Maker and the obligations he may think they impose, and the manner in which an expression shall be made by him of his belief on those subjects, no interference can be permitted, provided always the laws of society, designed to secure its peace and prosperity, and the morals of its people, are not interfered with.” See <em>Prince </em><page-number citation-index="1" label="88">*88</page-number>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U. S. 158. So we conclude that the District Court ruled properly when it withheld from the jury all questions concerning the truth or falsity of the religious beliefs or doctrines of respondents.</p>
<p id="b144-4">Respondents maintain that the reversal of the judgment of conviction was justified on other distinct grounds. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not reach those questions. Respondents may, of course, urge them here in support of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals. <em>Langnes </em>v. <em>Green, </em>282 U. S. 531, 538-539; <em>Story Parchment Co. </em>v. <em>Paterson Co., </em>282 U. S. 555, 560, 567-568. But since attention was centered on the issues which we have discussed, the remaining questions were not fully presented to this Court either in the briefs or oral argument. In view of these circumstances we deem it more appropriate to remand the cause to the Circuit Court of Appeals so that it may pass on the questions reserved. <em>Lutcher &amp; Moore Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>217 U. S. 257, 267-268; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>237 U. S. 583. If any questions of importance survive and are presented here, we will then have the benefit of the views of the Circuit Court of Appeals. Until that additional consideration is had, we cannot be sure that it will be necessary to pass on any of the other constitutional issues which respondents claim to have reserved.</p>
<p id="b144-5">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.</p>
<p id="b144-6">
<em>Reversed.</em>

<p id="b139-8"> Petitioner has placed three representations in this group: (1) A portion of the scheme as to healing which we have already quoted and which alleged that respondents “had in fact cured either by the activity of one, either, or all of said persons, hundreds of persons afflicted with diseases and ailments”; (2) The portion of the scheme relating to certain religious experiences described in certain books (Unveiled Mysteries and The Magic Presence) and concerning which the indictment alleged “that the defendants represented that Guy W. Ballard, Edna W. Ballard, and Donald Ballard actually encountered the experiences pertaining to each of their said names as related and <page-number citation-index="1" label="84">*84</page-number>set forth in said books, whereas in truth and in fact none of said persons did encounter the experiences”; (3) The part of the scheme concerning phonograph records sold by respondents on representations that they would bestow on purchasers “great blessings and rewards in their aim to achieve salvation” whereas respondents “well knew that said . . . records were man-made and had no ability to aid in achieving salvation.”</p>
