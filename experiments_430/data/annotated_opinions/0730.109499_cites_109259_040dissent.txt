 To argue, as do my Brethren, that the 1974 amendments are directed at the “States qua States,” and “dis-plací] state policies regarding the manner in which they will structure delivery of those governmental services which their citizens require,” ante, at 847, and therefore “directly penaliz[e] the States for choosing to hire governmental employees on terms different from those which Congress has sought to impose,” ante, at 849, is only to advance precisely the unsuccessful arguments made by the State of Washington in Case v. Bowles and the State of California in United States v. California .  The 1974 amendments are, however, an entirely legitimate exercise of the commerce power, not in the slightest restrained by any doctrine of state sovereignty cognizable in this Court, as Case v. Bowles, United States v. California, Maryland v. Wirtz , and our other pertinent precedents squarely and definitively establish.  Moreover, since Maryland v. Wirtz is overruled, the Fair Labor Standards Act is invalidated in its application to all state employees “in [any areas] that the States have regarded as integral parts of their governmental activities.” Ante, at 854 n. 18.  This standard is a meaningless limitation on the Court’s state-sovereignty doctrine, and thus today’s holding goes beyond even what the States of Washington and California urged in Case v. Bowles and United States v. California , and by its logic would overrule those cases and with them Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and certain reasoning in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S. 279, 284-285 (1973).  I cannot recall another instance in the Court’s history when the reasoning of so many decisions covering so long a span of time has been *872 discarded in such a roughshod manner.  That this is done without any justification not already often advanced and consistently rejected, clearly renders today’s decision an ipse dixit reflecting nothing but displeasure with a congressional judgment.  My Brethren’s treatment of Fry v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 542</citedDecision> (1975), further illustrates the paucity of legal reasoning or principle j ustifying today’s result.  Although the Economic Stabilization Act “displace[d] the States’ freedom,” ante, at 852 — the reason given for invalidating the 1974 amendments — the result in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> is not disturbed since the interference was temporary and only a national program enforced by the Federal Government could have alleviated the country’s economic crisis.  Thus, although my Brethren by fiat strike down the 1974 amendments without analysis of countervailing national considerations, <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> by contrary logic remains undisturbed because, on balance, countervailing national considerations override the interference with the State’s freedom.  Moreover, it is sophistry to say the Economic Stabilization Act “displaced no state choices,” ante, at 853, but that the 1974 amendments do, ante, at 848.  Obviously the Stabilization Act — no less than every exercise of a national power delegated to Congress by the Constitution — displaced the State’s freedom.  It is absurd to suggest that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between curbs against increasing wages and curbs against paying wages lower than the federal minimum.  Today’s holding patently is in derogation of the sovereign power of the Nation to regulate interstate commerce.  Can the States engage in businesses competing with the private sector and then come to the courts arguing that withdrawing the employees of those businesses from the private sector evades the power of the Federal Government to regulate commerce?  See New York v. *873 United States, 326 U. S., at 582 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  No principle given meaningful content by my Brethren today precludes the States from doing just that.  Our historic decisions rejecting all suggestions that the States stand in a different position from affected private parties when challenging congressional exercise of the commerce power reflect that very concern.  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936).  <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> only last Term emphasized “that States are not immune from all federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status.” <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 548</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  For “[b]y empowering Congress to regulate commerce .  .  .  the States necessarily surrendered any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regulation.” Farden v. Terminal R. Co., supra, at 192; see Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., supra, at 286.  Employment relations of States that subject themselves to congressional regulation by participating in regulable commerce are subject to congressional regulation.  California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553, 568 (1957).

 Office of Management and Budget, Special Analyses: Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1977, p. 255.  Appellants complain of the impact of the amended FLSA on police and fire departments, but the 1977 budget contemplates outlays for law enforcement assistance of $716 million.  Id., at 258.  Concern is also expressed about the diminished ability to hire students in the summer if States must pay them a minimum wage, but the Federal Government’s “summer youth program” provides $400 million for 670,000 jobs.  Ibid. Given this demonstrated ability to obtain funds from the Federal Government for needed state services, there is little doubt that the States’ influence in the political process is adequate to safeguard their sovereignty.  14 *879 My Brethren’s disregard for precedents recognizing these long-settled constitutional principles is painfully obvious in their cavalier treatment of Maryland v. Wirtz .  Without even a passing reference to the doctrine of stare decisis, Wirtz — regarded as controlling only last Term, <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 548</citedDecision> , and as good law in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S., at 283—is by exercise of raw judicial power overruled.  No effort is made to distinguish the FLSA amendments sustained in Wirtz from the 1974 amendments.  We are told at the outset that “the 'far-reaching implications’ of Wirtz should be overruled,” ante, at 840; later it is said that the “reasoning in Wirtz” is no longer “authoritative,” ante, at 854.  My Brethren then merely restate their essential-function test and say that Wirtz must “therefore” be overruled.  Ante, at 855-856.  There is no analysis whether Wirtz reached the correct result, apart from any flaws in reasoning, even though we are told that “there are obvious differences” between this case and Wirtz.  Ante, at 855.

 There is no claim that the 1974 amendments are not clearly intended to apply to the States, nor is there any suggestion that Congress was unaware of the federalism issue.  As support for the creation of a state sovereignty limitation on the commerce power, my Brethren quote this statement in Wirtz out of context.  Ante, at 842.  This statement is at the end of a paragraph in Wirtz recognizing that Congress’ commerce power is limited because it reaches only “ ‘commerce with foreign nations and among the several States.’ ” 392 U. S., at 196 , quoting Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S., at 466 .  The passage that follows the language quoted by the Court is: “But while the commerce power has limits, valid general regulations of commerce do not cease to be regulations of commerce because a State is involved.  If a State is engaging in economic activities that are validly regulated by the Federal Government when engaged in by private persons, the State too may be forced to conform its activities to federal regulation.” 392 U. S., at 196-197 .  It is clear, then, that this Court’s “ample power” to prevent the destruction of the States was not found in Wirtz to result from some affirmative limit on the exercise of the commerce power, but rather in the Court’s function of limiting congressional exercise of its power to regulation of “commerce.” The Court relies on Fry v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 542</citedDecision> , 547 n. 7 (1975), but I cannot subscribe to reading <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> as departing, without analysis, from a principle that has remained unquestioned for over 150 years.  Although the Tenth Amendment “is not without significance/’ ibid., its meaning is clear: it declares that our Federal Government is one of delegated powers.  And it is because of this constraint, rather than the state-sovereignty doctrine discovered today by the Court, “that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States’ integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Fry did not say that there is a limit in the Tenth Amendment on the exercise of a delegated power, but instead said that “Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that ....’’ The only import of the footnote in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> , then, *862 is that Congress may not invade state sovereignty by exercising powers not delegated to it by the Constitution; since the wage ceilings at issue in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> were clearly within the commerce power, we found no “drastic invasion of state sovereignty.” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 548 n. 7.  Even the author of today’s opinion stated in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> that the Tenth Amendment does not “by its terms” restrict Congress’ power to regulate commerce.  <citedDecision>Id., at 557</citedDecision> (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  In support of the first-quoted paragraph, Darby cited 2 J. Elliot, Debates 123, 131 (2d ed. 1787); 3 id., at 450, 464, 600; 4 id., at 140, 148; 1 Annals of Congress 432, 761, 767-768 (1789); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution §§ 1907-1908 (2d ed. 1851) (“It is plain, therefore, that it could not have been the intention of the framers of this amendment to give it effect, as an abridgment of any of the powers granted under the constitution, whether they are express or implied, direct or incidental.  Its sole design is to exclude any interpretation, by which other powers should be assumed beyond those which are granted”).  Decisions expressly rejecting today’s interpretation of the Tenth Amendment also include Sperry v. Florida ex rel. Florida Bar, 373 U. S. 379, 403 (1963); Oklahoma v. CSC, 330 U. S. 127, 143 (1947); Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92, 102 (1946); Fernandez v. Wiener, 326 U. S. 340 , 362 (1945); Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Atkinson Co., 313 U. S. 508, 534 (1941); United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 733-734 (1931).  Case also expressed concerns about creating a state-sovereignty limitation on a delegated power that are equally applicable to re *865 strictions on the commerce power: “The result would be that the constitutional grant of the power to malee war would be inadequate to accomplish its full purpose.  And this result would impair a prime purpose of the Federal Government’s establishment.” 327 U. S., at 102.  My Brethren intimate that Congress’ war power is more properly viewed as “a prime purpose of the Federal Government’s establishment” than the commerce power.

 But when Congress moderated its position and passed the bill in another form, the President signed it and noted the compromise: “S.  2747 also extends coverage to include Federal, State, and local government employees, domestic workers, and others previously excluded from coverage.  The Congress has reduced some of the economic and social disruptions this extension could cause by recognizing the unique requirements of police, fire, and correctional services.” 10 Weekly Comp, of Presidential Documents 392 (1974).  In contrast, my Brethren frequently remand powerless individuals to the political process by invoking doctrines of standing, jus-ticiability, and remedies.  For example, in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490 (1975), the Court suggested that some residents of Rochester, *879 N. Y., “not overlook the availability of the normal democratic process,” id., at 508 n. 18, even though they were challenging a suburban zoning ordinance and had no voice in the suburb’s political affairs.  In this case, however, those entities with perhaps the greatest representation in the political process have lost a legislative battle, but when they enter the courts and repeat the arguments made in the political branches, the Court welcomes them with open arms, embraces their political cause, and overrides Congress’ political decision.  In contrast, the Court measures the legislation at issue in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> in light of today’s decision, although, as I have noted, that consideration amounts to a repudiation of the Court’s holding.  See supra, at 872.  Just as the reasoning of Wirtz is rejected, however, the reasoning of <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> , decided only last Term, must also be deemed rejected, for it adhered totally to the principles of Wirtz .  That the Economic Stabilization Act was an emergency measure was not dis-positive in <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> ; it merely rendered the Act “even less intrusive” than the “quite limited” legislation sustained in Wirtz.  <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 548</citedDecision> .
