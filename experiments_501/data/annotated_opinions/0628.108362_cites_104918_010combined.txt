 .  and other Negro-Americans from enjoying and exercising their rights, privileges and immunities as citizens of the United States and the State of Mississippi, including but not limited to, their rights to freedom of speech, movement, association and assembly; the right to petition their government for redress of grievances; their right to be secure in their person; their right not to be enslaved nor deprived of life, liberty or property other than by due process of law, and their *92 rights to travel the public highways without restraint in the same terms as white citizens in Kemper County, Mississippi .  .  .  ." The jurisdiction of the federal court was invoked under the language of Rev. Stat. § 1980, 42 U. S. C. § 1985 (3), which provides: "If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws [and] in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages, occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators." The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, relying on the authority of this Court's opinion in Collins v. Hardyman, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 651</citedDecision> , which in effect construed the above language of § 1985 (3) as reaching only conspiracies under color of state law. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment of dismissal.  410 F. 2d 817 .  Judge Goldberg's thorough opinion for that court expressed "serious doubts" as to the "continued vitality" of <citedDecision>Collins</citedDecision> v. Hardyman, id., at 823, and stated that "it would not surprise us if Collins v. Hardyman were disapproved and if § 1985 (3) were held to embrace private conspiracies to interfere with rights of national citizenship," id., at 825-826 (footnote omitted), but concluded that "[s]ince we *93 may not adopt what the Supreme Court has expressly rejected, we obediently abide the mandate in <citedDecision>Collins</citedDecision> , " id., at 826-827.  We granted certiorari, 397 U. S. 1074 , to consider questions going to the scope and constitutionality of 42 U. S. C. § 1985 (3).  I Collins v. <citedDecision>Hardyman</citedDecision> was decided 20 years ago.  The complaint in that case alleged that the plaintiffs were members of a political club that had scheduled a meeting to adopt a resolution opposing the Marshall Plan, and to send copies of the resolution to appropriate federal officials; that the defendants conspired to deprive the plaintiffs of their rights as citizens of the United States peaceably to assemble and to equal privileges and immunities under the laws of the United States; that, in furtherance of the conspiracy, the defendants proceeded to the meeting site and, by threats and violence, broke up the meeting, thus interfering with the right of the plaintiffs to petition the Government for the redress of grievances; and that the defendants did not interfere or conspire to interfere with the meetings of other political groups with whose opinions the defendants agreed.  The Court held that this complaint did not state a cause of action under § 1985 (3): [1] "The complaint makes no claim that the conspiracy or the overt acts involved any action by state officials, or that defendants even pretended to act under color of state law. It is not shown that defendants had or claimed any protection or immunity from the law of the State, or that they in fact enjoyed such because of any act or omission by state authorities." <citedDecision>341 U. S., at 655</citedDecision> .  "What we have here is not a conspiracy to affect in any way these plaintiffs' equality of protection by *94 the law, or their equality of privileges and immunities under the law. There is not the slightest allegation that defendants were conscious of or trying to influence the law, or were endeavoring to obstruct or interfere with it.  .  .  .  Such private discrimination is not inequality before the law unless there is some manipulation of the law or its agencies to give sanction or sanctuary for doing so." <citedDecision>Id., at 661</citedDecision> .  The Court was careful to make clear that it was deciding no constitutional question, but simply construing the language of the statute, or more precisely, determining the applicability of the statute to the facts alleged in the complaint: [2] "We say nothing of the power of Congress to authorize such civil actions as respondents have commenced or otherwise to redress such grievances as they assert.  We think that Congress has not, in the narrow class of conspiracies defined by this statute, included the conspiracy charged here.  We therefore reach no constitutional questions." <citedDecision>Id., at 662</citedDecision> .  Nonetheless, the Court made equally clear that the construction it gave to the statute was influenced by the constitutional problems that it thought would have otherwise been engendered: "It is apparent that, if this complaint meets the requirements of this Act, it raises constitutional problems of the first magnitude that, in the light of history, are not without difficulty.  These would *95 include issues as to congressional power under and apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, the reserved power of the States, the content of rights derived from national as distinguished from state citizenship, and the question of separability of the Act in its application to those two classes of rights." <citedDecision>Id., at 659</citedDecision> .  Mr. Justice Burton filed a dissenting opinion, joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.  The dissenters thought that "[t]he language of the statute refutes the suggestion that action under color of state law is a necessary ingredient of the cause of action which it recognizes." <citedDecision>Id., at 663</citedDecision> .  Further, the dissenters found no constitutional difficulty in according to the statutory words their apparent meaning: "Congress certainly has the power to create a federal cause of action in favor of persons injured by private individuals through the abridgment of federally created constitutional rights.  It seems to me that Congress has done just this in [§ 1985 (3)].  This is not inconsistent with the principle underlying the Fourteenth Amendment.  That amendment prohibits the respective states from making laws abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States or denying to any person within the jurisdiction of a state the equal protection of the laws.  Cases holding that those clauses are directed only at state action are not authority for the contention that Congress may not pass laws supporting rights which exist apart from the Fourteenth Amendment." Id., at 664.  II Whether or not <citedDecision>Collins</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Hardyman</citedDecision> was correctly decided on its own facts is a question with which we need not here be concerned.  But it is clear, in the light of *96 the evolution of decisional law in the years that have passed since that case was decided, that many of the constitutional problems there perceived simply do not exist.  Little reason remains, therefore, not to accord to the words of the statute their apparent meaning.  That meaning is confirmed by judicial construction of related laws, by the structural setting of § 1985 (3) itself, and by its legislative history.  And a fair reading of the allegations of the complaint in this case clearly brings them within this meaning of the statutory language.  As so construed, and as applied to this complaint, we have no doubt that the statute was within the constitutional power of Congress to enact.  III We turn, then, to an examination of the meaning of § 1985 (3).  On their face, the words of the statute fully encompass the conduct of private persons.  The provision speaks simply of "two or more persons in any State or Territory" who "conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another." Going in disguise, in particular, is in this context an activity so little associated with official action and so commonly connected with private marauders that this clause could almost never be applicable under the artificially restrictive construction of <citedDecision>Collins</citedDecision> .  And since the "going in disguise" aspect must include private action, it is hard to see how the conspiracy aspect, joined by a disjunctive, could be read to require the involvement of state officers.  The provision continues, specifying the motivation required "for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws." This language is, of course, similar to that of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, *97 which in terms speaks only to the States, [3] and judicial thinking about what can constitute an equal protection deprivation has, because of the Amendment's wording, focused almost entirely upon identifying the requisite "state action" and defining the offending forms of state law and official conduct.  A century of Fourteenth Amendment adjudication has, in other words, made it understandably difficult to conceive of what might constitute a deprivation of the equal protection of the laws by private persons.  Yet there is nothing inherent in the phrase that requires the action working the deprivation to come from the State.  See, e. g., United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 643 .  Indeed, the failure to mention any such requisite can be viewed as an important indication of congressional intent to speak in § 1985 (3) of all deprivations of "equal protection of the laws" and "equal privileges and immunities under the laws," whatever their source.  The approach of this Court to other Reconstruction civil rights statutes in the years since <citedDecision>Collins</citedDecision> has been to "accord [them] a sweep as broad as [their] language." United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 801 ; Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409, 437 .  Moreover, very similar language in closely related statutes has early and late received an interpretation quite inconsistent with that given to § 1985 (3) in <citedDecision>Collins</citedDecision> .  In construing the exact criminal counterpart of § 1985 (3), the Court in United States v. Harris, supra , observed that the statute was "not limited to take effect only in case [of state action]," id., at 639 , but "was framed to protect from invasion by private persons, the equal privileges *98 and immunities under the laws, of all persons and classes of persons," id., at 637 .  In United States v. Williams, 341 U. S. 70 , the Court considered the closest remaining criminal analogue to § 1985 (3), 18 U. S. C. § 241 .  [4] Mr. Justice Frankfurter's plurality opinion, without contravention from the concurrence or dissent, concluded that "if language is to carry any meaning at all it must be clear that the principal purpose of [§ 241], unlike [ 18 U. S. C. § 242 ], was to reach private action rather than officers of a State acting under its authority.  Men who `go in disguise upon the public highway, or upon the premises of another' are not likely to be acting in official capacities." 341 U. S., at 76.  "Nothing in [the] terms [of § 241] indicates that color of State law was to be relevant to prosecution under it."

 We have a case of a lawless political brawl, precipitated by a handful of white citizens against other white citizens." 341 U. S., at 662.  [3]  "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." [4]  "If two or more persons conspire to injure oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same; or "If two or more persons go in disguise on the highway, or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured "They shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both." The penalty section was amended in 1968.  See 18 U. S. C. § 241 (1964 ed., Supp. V).  [5]  This last was suggested in <citedDecision>Collins</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Hardyman</citedDecision> See n. 2, supra. [6]  "Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress." [7]  "If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another .  .  .  for the purpose of preventing or hindering the constituted authorities of any State or Territory from giving or securing to all persons within such State or Territory the equal protection of the laws .  .  .
