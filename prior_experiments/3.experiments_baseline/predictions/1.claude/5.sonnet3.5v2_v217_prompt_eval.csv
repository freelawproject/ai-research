This is evident in multiple statements, including 'we have concluded, however, that Grady must be overruled' and 'because Grady contradicted an unbroken line of decisions, contained less than accurate historical analysis, and has produced confusion, we do so here.' The Court directly states that Grady was a 'mistake' and provides detailed reasoning for overturning it.""
}

The passages show multiple explicit statements that the Target Case (Grady v. Corbin) was overruled by the Acting Case. The Court's majority opinion directly states this and provides extensive reasoning for why the overruling was necessary, including that Grady contradicted previous decisions, contained flawed historical analysis, and created confusion in application. This is a clear example of an Explicit Negative Action where the Court directly overrules the Target Case."
