 Cf. United States v. New York Central R. Co., 272 U. S. 457 , 464.  The recognized need of drafting a workable statute and the well known circumstances in which it was to be applied are persuasive of the conclusion, which the legislative history supports, S. Rept. No. 884, 75th Cong. 1st Sess., pp. 7 and 8; H. Rept. No. 2738, 75th Cong. 3d Sess., p. 17, that the “production for commerce” intended includes at least production of goods, which, at the time of production, the employer, according to the normal course of his business, intends or expects to move in interstate commerce although, through the exigencies of the business, all of the goods may not thereafter actually enter interstate commerce.  2 There remains the question whether such restriction on the production of goods for commerce is a permissible exercise of the commerce power.  The power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states.  It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.  See McCul *119 loch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 .  Cf. United States v. Ferger, <citedDecision>250 U. S. 199</citedDecision> .  While this Court has many times found state regulation of interstate commerce, when uniformity of its regulation is of national concern, to be incompatible with the Commerce Clause even though Congress has not legislated on the subject, the Court has never implied such restraint on state control over matters intrastate not deemed to be regulations of interstate commerce or its instrumentalities even though they affect the commerce.  Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352 , 398 et seq., and case cited; 410 et seq., and cases cited.  In the absence of Congressional legislation on the subject state laws which are not regulations of the commerce itself or its instrumentalities are not forbidden even though they affect interstate commerce.  Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1 ; Bacon v. Illinois, 227 U. S. 504 ; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245 ; Oliver Iron Co. v. Lord, 262 U. S. 172 .  But it does not follow that Congress may not by appropriate legislation regulate intrastate activities where they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  See Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 303 U. S. 453, 466 .

 See National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 38, 40 ; National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, 306 U. S. 601, 604 , and cases cited.  But long before the adoption of the National Labor Relations Act this Court had many times held that the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce extends to the regulation through legislative action of activities in *120 trastate which have a substantial effect on the commerce or the exercise of the Congressional power over it.  3 In such legislation Congress has sometimes left it to the courts to determine whether the intrastate activities have the prohibited effect on the commerce, as in the Sherman Act.  It has sometimes left it to an administrative board or agency to determine whether the activities sought to be regulated or prohibited have such effect, as in the case of the Interstate Commerce Act, and the National Labor Relations Act, or whether they come within the statutory definition of the prohibited Act, as in the Federal Trade Commission Act.  And sometimes Congress itself has said that a particular activity affects the commerce, as it did in the present Act, the Safety Appliance Act and the Railway Labor Act.  In passing on the validity of legislation of the class last mentioned the only function of courts is to determine whether the particular activity regulated or prohibited is within the reach *121 of the federal power.  See United States v. <citedDecision>Ferger, supra;</citedDecision> Virginian Ry. Co. v. Federation, 300 U. S. 515, 553 .  Congress, having by the present Act adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards, it may choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involve control of intrastate activities.  Such legislation has often been sustained with respect to powers, other than the commerce power granted to the national government, when the means chosen, although not themselves within the granted power, were nevertheless deemed appropriate aids to the accomplishment of some purpose within an admitted power of the national government.  See Jacob Ruppert, Inc. v. Caffey, 251 U. S. 264 ; Everard’s Breweries v. Day, 265 U. S. 545, 560 ; Westfall v. United States, 274 U. S. 256, 259 .  As to state power under the Fourteenth Amendment, compare Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S. 606, 609 ; St. John v. New York, 201 U. S. 633 ; Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192, 201-202 .  A familiar like exercise of power is the regulation of intrastate transactions which are so commingled with or related to interstate commerce that all must be regulated if the interstate commerce is to be effectively controlled.  Shreveport Case, 234 U. S. 342 ; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563 ; United States v. New York Central R. Co., supra, 464; Currin v. Wallace, 306 U. S. 1 ; Mulford v. Smith, supra. Similarly Congress may require inspection and preventive treatment of all cattle in a disease infected area in order to prevent shipment in interstate commerce of some of the cattle without the treatment.
