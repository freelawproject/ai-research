 The whites testified that just before getting in the car appellant slapped Herman Landry, one of the white boys, on the elbow.  The Negroes testified that appellant had not slapped Landry, but liad merely touched him.  The trial judge concluded that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Duncan had committed simple battery, and found him guilty.  I.  The Fourteenth Amendment denies the States the power to “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” In resolving conflicting *148 claims concerning the meaning of this spacious language, the Co'urt has looked increasingly to the Bill of Rights for guidance; many of the rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution have been held to be protected against state action by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  That clause now protects the right to compensation for property taken by the State; 4 the rights of speech, press, and religion covered by the First Amendment; 5 the Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and to have excluded from criminal trials any evidence illegally seized; 6 the right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to be free of compelled self-incrimination; 7 and the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, 8 to a speedy 9 and public 10 trial, to confrontation of opposing witnesses, 11 and to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses.  12 The test for determining whether a right extended by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments with respect to federal criminal proceedings is also protected against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment has been phrased in a variety of ways in the opinions of this Court. The question has been asked whether a right is among those “ 'fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,' ” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 67 (1932); 13 whether *149 it is “basic in our system of jurisprudence,” In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273 (1948); and whether it is “a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,” Gideon v. Wainwright, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 335, 343-344</citedDecision> (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965).  The claim before us is that the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment meets these tests.  The position of Louisiana, on the other hand, is that the Constitution imposes upon the States no duty to give a jury trial in any criminal case, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or the size of the punishment which may be imposed.  Because we believe that trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American scheme of justice, we hold that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in all criminal cases which — were they to be tried in a federal court — would come within the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee.  14 Since we consider the appeal be *150 fore us to be such a case, we hold that the Constitution was violated when appellant’s demand for jury trial was refused.  *151 The history of trial by jury in criminal cases has been frequently told.  15 It is sufficient for present purposes to say that by the time our Constitution was written, jury trial in criminal cases had been in existence in England for several centuries and carried impressive credentials traced by many to Magna Carta.

 “Whoever commits a simple battery shaH be fined not more than three hundred dollars, or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.” 250 La. 253 , 195 So. 2d 142 (1967).  389 U. S. 809 (1967).  Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897).  See, e. g., Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U. S. 380 (1927).  See Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961).  Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964).  Gideon v.

**Concurrence Opinion**
 The Court today holds that the right to trial by jury guaranteed defendants in criminal cases in federal courts by Art. Ill of the United States Constitution and by the Sixth Amendment is also guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to defendants tried in state courts.  With *163 this holding I agree for reasons given by the Court. I also agree because of reasons given in my dissent in Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 68 .  In that dissent, at 90, I took the position, contrary to the holding in Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 , that the Fourteenth Amendment made all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States.  This Court in Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 323 , decided in 1937, although saying “[tjhere is no such general rule,” went on to add that the Fourteenth Amendment may make it unlawful for a State to abridge by its statutes the “freedom of speech which the First Amendment safeguards against encroachment by the Congress... or the like freedom of the press ... or the free exercise of religion ... or the right of peaceable assembly ... or the right of one accused of crime to the benefit of counsel .... In these and other situations immunities that are valid as against the federal government by force of the specific pledges of particular amendments have been found to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and thus, through the Fourteenth Amendment, become valid as against the states.” Id., at 324-325 .  And the Palko opinion went on to explain, 302 U. S., at 326 , that certain Bill of Rights’ provisions were made applicable to the States by bringing them “within the Fourteenth Amendment by a process of absorption.” Thus Twining v. New Jersey, supra, refused to hold that any one of the Bill of Rights’ provisions was made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, but Palko , which must be read as overruling Twining on this point, concluded that the Bill of Rights Amendments that are “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty” are “absorbed” by the.  Fourteenth as protections against *164 state invasion.  In this situation I said in Adamson v. California, 332 U. S., at 89 , that, while “I would ... extend to all the people of the nation the complete protection of the Bill of Rights,” that “[i]f the choice must be between the selective process of the Palko decision applying some of the Bill of Rights to the States, or the Twining rule applying none of them, I would choose the Palko selective process.” See Gideon v. Wainwright, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 335</citedDecision> .  And I am very happy to support this selective process through which our Court has since the Adamson case held most of the specific Bill of Rights’ protections applicable to the States to the same extent they are applicable to the Federal Government.  Among these are the right to trial by jury decided today, the right against compelled self-incrimination, the right to counsel, the right to compulsory process for witnesses, the right to confront witnesses, the right to a speedy and public trial, and the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  All of these holdings making Bill of Rights’ provisions applicable as such to the States mark, of course, a departure from the Twining doctrine holding that none of those provisions were enforceable as such against the States.  The dissent in this case, however, makes a spirited and forceful defense of that now discredited doctrine.  I do not believe that it is necessary for me to repeat the historical and logical reasons for my challenge to the Twining holding contained in my Adamson dissent and Appendix to it.  What I wrote there in 1947 was the product of years of study and research.
