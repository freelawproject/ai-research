**Concurrence Opinion**
Me. Justice Black and Me. Justice Douglas, concurring: We are substantially in agreement with the opinion just read, but since we originally joined with the Court in the Gobitis case, it is appropriate that we make a brief statement of reasons for our change of view.  Reluctance to make the Federal Constitution a rigid bar against state regulation of conduct thought inimical to the public welfare was the controlling influence which moved us to consent to the Gobitis decision.  Long reflection convinced us that although the principle is sound, its application in the particular case was wrong.  Jones v. <citedDecision>Opelika, 316 U. S. 584, 623</citedDecision> .  We believe that the statute before us fails to accord full scope to the freedom of religion secured to the appellees by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The statute requires the appellees to participate in a ceremony aimed at inculcating respect for the flag and for this country.  The Jehovah’s Witnesses, without any desire to show disrespect for either the flag or the country, interpret the Bible as commanding, at the risk of God’s displeasure, that they not go through the form of a pledge of allegiance to any flag.  The devoutness of their belief is evidenced by their willingness to suffer persecution and punishment, rather than make the pledge.  No well-ordered society can leave to the individuals an absolute right to make final decisions, unassailable by the State, as to everything they will or will not do.  The First Amendment does not go so far.
