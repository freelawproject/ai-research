<p id="b108-10">In these cases, the plaintiffs ask equity to enjoin white property owners who are desirous of selling their houses to Negro buyers simply because the houses were subject to an original agreement not to have them pass into Negro ownership. Equity is rooted in conscience. An injunction' is, as it always has been, “an extraordinary remedial process which is granted, not as a matter of right but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion.” <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Work, </em>266 U. S. 481, 490. In good conscience, it cannot be “the exercise of a sound judicial discretion” by a federal court to grant the relief here asked for when the authorization of such an injunction by the States' of the Union violates the Constitution— and violates it, not for any narrow technical reason, but for considerations that touch rights so basic to our society that, after the Civil War, their protection against invasion by the States was safeguarded by the Constitution. This is to me a sufficient and conclusive ground for reaching the Court’s result.</p>
