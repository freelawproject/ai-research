 Thus, it may not exact a license tax for the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce (McGold rick v. Berwind-White Co., 309 U. S. 33 , 56-58), although it may tax the property used in, or the income derived from, that commerce, so long as those taxes are not discriminatory.  Id., p. 47 and cases cited.  A license tax applied to activities guaranteed by the First Amendment would have the same destructive effect.  It is true that the First Amendment, like the commerce clause, draws no distinction between license taxes, fixed sum taxes, and other kinds of taxes.  But that is no reason why we should shut our eyes to the nature of the tax and its destructive influence.  The power to impose a license tax on the exercise of these freedoms is indeed as potent as the power of censorship which this Court has repeatedly struck down.  Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 ; Schneider v. State, supra; Cantwell v. Connecticut, <citedDecision>310 U. S. 296, 306</citedDecision> ; Largent v. Texas, 318 U. S. 418 ; Jamison v. Texas, supra. It was for that reason that the dissenting opinions in Jones v. Opelika, supra, stressed the nature of this type of tax. 316 U. S. pp. 607-609, 620, 623.  In that case, as in the present ones, we have something very different from a registration system under which those going from house to house are required to give their names, addresses and other marks of identification to the authorities.  In all of these cases the issuance of the permit or license is dependent on the payment of a license tax. And the license tax is fixed in amount and unrelated to the scope of the activities of petitioners or to their realized revenues.  It is not a nominal fee *114 imposed as a regulatory measure to defray the expenses of policing the activities in question.  8 It is in no way apportioned.  It is a flat license tax levied and collected as a condition to the pursuit of activities whose enjoyment is guaranteed by the First Amendment.  Accordingly, it restrains in advance those constitutional liberties of press and religion and inevitably tends to suppress their exercise.

 Jehovah’s Witnesses are not “above the law.” But the present ordinance is not directed to the problems with which the police power of the state is free to deal.  It does not cover, and petitioners are not charged with, breaches of the peace.  They are pursuing their solicitations peacefully and quietly.  Petitioners, moreover, are not charged with or prosecuted for the use of language which is obscene, abusive, or which incites retaliation.  Cf. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra. Nor do we have here., as we did in Cox v. New Hampshire, supra, and Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra, state regulation of the streets to protect and insure the safety, comfort, or convenience of the public.  Furthermore, the present ordinance is not narrowly drawn to safeguard the people of the community in their homes against the evils of solicitations.  See <citedDecision>Cantwell</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Connecticut, supra, 306</citedDecision> .  As we have said, it is not merely a registration ordinance calling for an identification of the solicitors so as to give the authorities some basis for investigating strangers coming into the community.  And the fee is not a nominal one, imposed as a regulatory measure and calculated to defray the expense of protecting those on the streets and at home against the abuses of solicitors.  See Cox v. New Hamp *117 shire, supra, pp. 576-577.  Nor can the present ordinance survive if we assume that it has been construed to apply only to solicitation from house to house.  10 The ordinance is not narrowly drawn to prevent or control abuses or evils arising from that activity.  Rather, it sets aside the residential areas as a prohibited zone, entry of which is denied petitioners unless the tax is paid.
