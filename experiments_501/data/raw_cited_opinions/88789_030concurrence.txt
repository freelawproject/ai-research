<p id="AQ">concurring in the judgment: I concur in the affirmance of the judgment in this case. I see no reason to doubt that it was the intention of Congress not to give the exemption claimed. The exercise of the power may be waived. But I hold that the road is a National instrumentality of such a character that Congress may interpose and protect it from State taxation whenever that body <page-number citation-index="1" label="38">*38</page-number>shall deem it proper to do so. For some of the leading authorities in support of the principle involved in this view of the subject I refer to the <em>Chicago and Northwestern Railway </em>v. <em>Fuller,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided by this court a short time ago.</p>
<p id="b50-4">Decree affirmed.</p>
