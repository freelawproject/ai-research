**Combined Opinion**
 A similar result was reached in the recent ruling in relation to what was deemed to be the correlative case of leases by Oklahoma of lands held by the State for the support of its schools.  Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Company, 285 U. S. 393 .  These decisions are not controlling here.  The nature and purpose of copyrights place them in a distinct category and we are unable to find any basis for the supposition that a nondiscriminatory tax on royalties hampers in the slightest degree the execution of the policy of the copyright statute.  We agree, however, with the contention that in this aspect royalties from copyrights stand in the same position as royalties from the use of patent rights, and what we have said as to the purposes of the Government in relation to copyrights applies as well, mutatis mutandis, to patents which are granted under the same constitutional authority to promote the progress of science and useful arts. The affirmance of the judgment in the instant case cannot be reconciled with the decision in Long v. Rockwood, 277 U. S. 142 , upon which appellant relies, and in view of the conclusions now reached upon a re-examination of the question, that case is definitely overruled.  Judgment affirmed.  1 See, also, Carroll v. Safford, 3 How. 441, 461 ; Tucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall. 527, 572 ; Wisconsin Railroad Co. v. Price County, 133 U. S. 496, 505 ; Irwin v. Wright, 258 U. S. 219, 228, 229 ; New Brunswick v.

S. 279, 282 .  2 Even the reservation to the United States, in its grant of property, of a right of user for particular governmental purposes does not necessarily withdraw the property granted from the taxing power of the State.  Baltimore Shipbuilding Co. v. Baltimore, 195 U. S. 375 .  Property in private ownership is not rendered non-taxable by the mere fact that it is the property of an agent of the Government and is used in the conduct of the agentâ€™s operations and is necessary for the agency, when Congress has not provided for its exemption.  Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 33 ; Central Pacific R. Co. v. California, 162 U. S. 91, 125 ; Gromer v. Standard Dredging Co., 224 U. S. 362, 371 ; Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf R. Co. v.
