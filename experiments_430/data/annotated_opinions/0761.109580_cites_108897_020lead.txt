 Corvallis Sand had been digging in the disputed part of the riverbed for 40 to 50 years without a lease from the State.  The State brought an ejectment action against Corvallis Sand, seeking to recover 11 separate parcels of riverbed, as well as damages for the use of the parcels.  The State’s complaint alleged that by virtue of its sovereignty it was the owner in fee simple of the disputed portions of the riverbed, and that it was entitled to immediate possession and damages.  Corvallis Sand denied the State’s ownership of the bed.  *366 Each party was partially successful in the Oregon courts, 1 and we granted cross petitions for certiorari.  423 U. S. 1048 .  Those courts understandably felt that our recent decision in Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, <citedDecision>414 U. S. 313</citedDecision> (1973), required that they ascertain and apply principles of federal common law to the controversy.  Twenty-six States have joined in three amicus briefs urging that we reconsider <citedDecision>Bonelli, supra,</citedDecision> because of what they assert is its significant departure from long-established precedent in this Court. I The nature of the litigation and the contentions of the parties may be briefly stated.  Title to two distinct portions of land has been at issue throughout.  The first of these portions has apparently been within the bed of the Willamette River since Oregon’s admission into the Union.  The other portion of the land underlies the river in an area known as Fischer Cut, which was not a part of the riverbed at the time Oregon was admitted to the Union.  The trial'court found that prior to a flood which occurred in November 1909, the Willamette flowed around a peninsula-like formation known as Fischer Island, but that by 1890 a clearly discernible overflow channel across the neck of the peninsula had developed.  Before 1909 this channel carried *367 the flow of the river only at its intermediate or high stages, and the main channel of the river continued to flow around Fischer Island.  But in November 1909, a major flood, in the words of the Oregon trial court, “suddenly and with great force and violence converted Fischer Cut into the main channel of the river.” The trial court, sitting without a jury, awarded all parcels in dispute, except for the Fischer Cut lands, to the State.

 Over a period of years the Colorado River had migrated gradually eastward, eroding its east bank and depositing alluvion on its west bank in the process.  In the course of this movement of the river the Bonelli land, which had at the time of patent been on the east bank, was submerged, and, until the rechanneling project, most of it was under water.  After the completion of the rechanneling project the bed of the Colorado River was substantially narrowed, and the Bonelli land re-emerged.  The Supreme Court of Arizona held that Arizona owned the title to the beds of navigable rivers within its borders, and that Arizona therefore acquired title to the Bonelli land when it became part of the riverbed as a result of the eastward migration of the Colorado.  That court went on to hold that under state law the re-emergence of the land was an avulsive change, which did not divest the State of its title to the exposed land.  This Court granted certiorari and reversed the Supreme Court of Arizona.  We phrased the critical inquiry in Bonelli in these words: “The issue before us is not what rights the State has accorded private [land] owners in lands which the State holds as sovereign; but, rather, how far the State’s sovereign right extends under the equal-footing doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act — whether the State retains title to the lands formerly beneath the stream of the Colorado River or whether that title is defeasible by the withdrawal of those waters.” <citedDecision>414 U. S., at 319-320</citedDecision> .  (Emphasis added.) We held that federal common law should govern in deciding whether a State retained title to lands which had reemerged from the bed of a navigable stream, relying in part on Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296 U. S. 10 (1935)., That case held that the extent and validity of a federal grant was a question to be resolved by federal law, and in Bonelli *370 we decided that the nature of the title conferred by the equal-footing doctrine set forth hr Pollard’s Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. 212 (1845), should likewise be governed by federal common law. Under the equal-footing doctrine “the new States since admitted have the same rights, sovereignty and jurisdiction ... as the original States possess within their respective borders.” Mumford v. Wardwell, 6 Wall. 423, 436 (1867).  Pollard’s Lessee held that under the equal-footing doctrine new States, upon their admission to the Union, acquire title to the lands underlying navigable waters within their boundaries.  We went on to discuss the nature of the sovereign’s interest in the riverbed, which we found to lie in the protection of navigation, fisheries, and similar purposes.  We held that under federal common law, as we construed it in that case, Arizona’s sovereign interest in the re-emerged land was not sufficient to enable it to retain title.  We found the principle governing title to lands which have been formed by accretion, rather than that which governs title where there has been an avulsive change in the channel of the river, to be applicable.

 6 For example, this Court has held that subsequent changes in the contour of the land, as well as subsequent transfers of the land, are governed by the state law. Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 343 (1906).  Indeed, the rule that lands once having passed from the Federal Government are subject to the laws of the State in which they lie antedates Pollard’s Lessee .  As long ago as 1839, the Court said: “We hold the true principle to be this, that whenever the question in any Court, state or federal, is, whether a title to land which had once been the property of the United States has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws of the United States; but that whenever, according to those laws, the title shall have passed, then that property, like all other property in the state, is subject to state legislation; so far as that legislation is consistent with the admission that the title passed and vested according to the laws of the United States.” Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet., at 517 .  (Emphasis added.) *378 The contrary approach would result in a perverse application of the equal-footing doctrine.  An original State would be free to choose its own legal principles to resolve property disputes relating to land under its riverbeds; a subsequently admitted State would be constrained by the equal-footing doctrine to apply the federal common-law rule, which may result in property law determinations antithetical to the desires of that State.  See <citedDecision>Bonelli, 414 U. S., at 332-333</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., dissenting).  Thus, if the lands at issue did pass under the equal-footing doctrine, state title is not subject to defeasance and state law governs subsequent dispositions.  7 IV A similar result obtains in the case of riparian lands which did not pass under the equal-footing doctrine.  This Court has consistently held that state law governs issues relating to this property, like other real property, unless some other principle of federal law requires a different result.  Under our federal system, property ownership is not governed by a general federal law, but rather by the laws of the several States.  “The great body of law in this country which controls acquisition, transmission, and transfer of property, and defines the rights of its owners in relation to the state or to private parties, is found in the statutes and decisions of the state.” Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 144, 155 (1944).  This is particularly true with respect *379 to real property, for even when federal common law was in its heyday under the teachings of Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1 (1842), an exception was carved out for the local law of real property.

 We are also persuaded that, in large part because of the positions taken in the briefs presented to the Court in Bonelli, the Bonelli decision was not a deliberate repudiation of all the cases which had gone before.  We there proceeded on the view, which we now think to have been mistaken, that Borax, supra, should be read so expansively as to in effect overrule sub silentio the line of eases following Pollard’s Lessee .  For all of these reasons, we have now decided that Bonelli’s application of federal common law to cases such as this must be overruled.  The judgment under review is vacated, and the case remanded to the Supreme Court of Oregon for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  The case was brought and tried in the Circuit Court of Benton County, Ore. Both parties appealed from the judgment rendered by that court to the Oregon Court of Appeals.  Subsequent to that judgment, our decision in Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, <citedDecision>414 U. S. 313</citedDecision> (1973), had come down and the Court of Appeals employed the reasoning of Bonelli in deciding the appeal.  Both parties then sought review in the Supreme Court of Oregon, which granted discretionary review limited to the factual question of the length of a channel known as Fischer Cut, modified the Court of Appeals’ decision in this respect, and, without discussion, affirmed the decision “[i]n all other respects.” Because of this procedural history we shall, as a matter of convenience, refer in the course of this opinion to rulings and findings of the “Oregon courts." The court quoted the following language from Commissioners in support of that rule: “1 [The accretion rule] is applicable to and governs cases where the boundary line, the thread of the stream, by the slow and gradual processes of erosion and accretion creeps across the intervening space between its old and its new location.  To this rule, however, there is a well-established and rational exception.  It is that, where a river changes its main channel, not by excavating, passing over, and then filling the intervening place between its old and its new main channel, but by flowing around this intervening land, which never becomes in the meantime its main channel, *368 and the change from the old to the new main channel is wrought during many years by the gradual or occasional increase from year to year of the proportion of the waters of the river passing over the course which eventually becomes the new main channel, and the decrease from year to year of the proportion of its waters passing through the old main channel until the greater part of its waters flow through the new main channel, the boundary line between the estates remains in the old channel subject to such changes in that channel as are wrought by erosion or accretion while the water in it remains a running stream.  .  .

 Counsel for amici urged that Bonelli be overruled.  Counsel for the State agreed that a re-examination of Bonelli would be appropriate, and that upon such re-examination issues such as those in this case should be left to state law. Tr. of Oral Arg. 34.  Arizona, in its brief, also relied upon the Submerged Lands Act of 1963, 43 U. S. C. § 1301 .  However, as discussed in Bonelli, the Submerged Lands Act did not alter the scope or effect of the equal-footing doctrine, nor did it alter state property law regarding riparian ownership.  The effect of the Act was merely to confirm the States’- title to the beds of navigable waters within their boundaries as against any claim of the United States Government.  As merely a declaration of the States’ preexisting rights in the riverbeds, nothing in the Act in any way mandates, or even indicates, that federal common law should be used to resolve *372 'ownership of lands which, by the very terms of the Act, reside in the States.  We recognized as much in Bonelli, see <citedDecision>414 U. S., at 318</citedDecision> , and our references to the Act in Bonelli in no way indicate that it was the Act, rather than the scope of the equal-footing doctrine, which resulted in our application of federal common law: “Since the Act does not extend to the States any interest beyond those afforded by the equal-footing doctrine, the State can no more base its claim to lands unnecessary to a navigational purpose on the Submerged Lands Act than on that doctrine.” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 324r-325.  The compact entered into when Alabama was admitted to the Union contained the following language: “‘[A]ll navigable waters within the said state shall for ever remain public highways, free to the citizens of said state, and of the United States, without any tax, duty, impost, or toll therefor, imposed by the said state.’.  .  .” 3 How., at 229 .  The Court found that this language merely enunciated Congress’ right to regulate commerce upon the navigable waters, similarly reserved to it with respect to the original States, and thus the language did not detract from the State’s absolute title in the bed.  Id., at 229-230 .  Amici Utah and New Mexico also urge us to reconsider our decision in Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290 (1967).  They advance the same reasons for such reconsideration as they do with respect to Bonelli.  But Hughes was not cited by the Oregon courts below, and in Bonelli we expressly declined to rely upon it as a basis for our decision there, see <citedDecision>414 U. S., at 321</citedDecision> n. 11.  We therefore have no occasion to address the issue.  We are aware of the fact that Hughes gave to Borax the same sort of expansive construction as did Bonelli, but we are likewise aware that Hughes dealt with oeeanfront property, a fact which the Court thought sufficiently different from the usual situation so as to justify a “federal common law” rule of riparian proprietorship: “The rule deals with waters that lap both the lands of the State and the boundaries of the international sea.  This relationship, at this particular point of the marginal sea, is too close to the vital interest of the Nation in its own boundaries to allow it to be governed by any law but the 'supreme Law of the Land.’ ” 389 U. S., at 293 .  We are fortified in our conclusion that Bonelli’s equal-footing analysis was unsound by the fact that its author has likewise rejected it.  The dissenting opinion of our Brother Marshall, post, p. 382, would sustain the result reached in Bonelli but on a ground explicitly avoided in the Bonelli opinion.  The "mystery” or "puzzle” to which our Brother refers, post, at 384, turns out to be nonexistent; in rejecting Bonelli’s equal-footing analysis, we are simply refusing to be more Roman than the Romans.
