 On my reading, the Court of Appeals’ decision and, even more clearly, the Board’s decision here for review, were based solely on § 7, not on the First Amendment; and this Court ought initially consider the statutory question without reference to the First Amendment — the question on which the Court remands.  But even under the Court’s reading of the opinions of the Board and the Court of Appeals, the statutory question on which it remands is now before the Court. By bypassing that question and reaching out to overrule a constitutionally based decision, the Court surely departs from traditional modes of adjudication.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on purely statutory grounds.  And on the merits of the only question that the Court decides, I dissent from the overruling of Logan Valley.  I The Court views the history of this litigation as one of “shifting positions” and “considerable confusion.” To be sure, the Board’s position has not been constant.  But the ultimate decisions by the Administrative Law Judge *527 and by the Board rested solely on § 7 of the NLRA, not on the First Amendment.  As the Court indicates, the Board’s initial determination that petitioner violated §8 (a)(1) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (a)(1), was based on its reading of Logan Valley, a First Amendment case. But before the Court of Appeals reviewed this initial determination, this Court decided Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1972), and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 (1972), and the Board moved to have the case remanded for reconsideration in light of these two decisions.  The Court of Appeals granted the motion.  Lloyd and Central Hardware demonstrated, each in its own way, that Logan Valley could not be read as broadly as some Courts of Appeals had read it.  And together they gave a signal to the Board and to the Court of Appeals that it would be wise to pass upon statutory contentions in cases of this sort before turning to broad constitutional questions, the answers to which could no longer be predicted with certainty.  See Central Hardware, supra, at 548, 549 (Maeshall, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>Lloyd, supra, at 584</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Taking heed of this signal, the Administrative Law Judge and the Board proceeded on remand to assess the conflicting rights of the employees and the shopping center owner within the framework of the NLRA.  The Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation that petitioner be found guilty of a § 8 (a)(1) violation rested explicitly on the statutory test enunciated by this Court in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105 (1956).  That the Administrative Law Judge supported his “realistic view of the facts” by referring to this Court’s “factual view” of the Logan Valley case surely cannot be said to alter the judge’s explicitly stated legal theory, which was a statutory one.  *528 Even more clearly, the Board’s rationale in agreeing with the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation was exclusively a statutory one.  Nowhere in the Board’s decision, Hudgens v. Local SIS, Retail, Wholesale & Dept. Store Union, 205 N. L. R. B. 628 (1973), is there any reference to the First Amendment or any' constitutionally based decision.  The Board reached its result “for the reasons specifically set forth in Frank Vis-ceglia and Vincent Visceglia, t/a Peddie Buildings,” 1 ibid., a case decided solely on § 7 grounds.

 Given that concern, the crucial fact in Marsh was that the company owned the traditional forums essential for effective communication; it was immaterial that the company also owned a sewer system and that its property in other respects resembled a town.  In Logan Valley we recognized what the Court today refuses to recognize — that the owner of the modern shopping center complex, by dedicating his property to public use as a business district, to some extent displaces ■the “State” from control of historical First Amendment forums, and may acquire a virtual monopoly of places suitable for effective communication.  The roadways, parking lots, and walkways of the modern shopping cen *540 ter may be as essential for effective speech as the streets and sidewalks in the municipal or company-owned town.  7 I simply cannot reconcile the Court’s denial of any role for the First Amendment in the shopping center with Marsh’s recognition of a full role for the First Amendment on the streets and sidewalks of the company-owned town.  My reading of Marsh admittedly carried me farther than the Court in Lloyd, but the Lloyd Court remained responsive in its own way to the concerns underlying Marsh. Lloyd retained the availability of First Amendment protection when the picketing is related to the function of the shopping center, and when there is no other reasonable opportunity to convey the message to the intended audience.  Preserving Logan Valley subject to Lloyd’s two related criteria guaranteed that the First Amendment would have application in those situations in which the shopping center owner had most clearly monopolized the forums essential for effective communication.  This result, although not the optimal one in my view, Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, <citedDecision>407 U. S., at 579-583</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., dissenting), is nonetheless defensible.  In Marsh , the private entity had displaced the “state” from control of all the places to which the public had historically enjoyed access for First Amendment purposes, and the First Amendment was accordingly held fully applicable to the private entity’s conduct.  The shopping center owner, on the other hand, controls only *541 a portion of such places, leaving other traditional public forums available to the citizen.  But the shopping center owner may nevertheless control all places essential for the effective undertaking of some speech-related activities — namely, those related to the activities of the shopping center.  As for those activities, then, the First Amendment ought to have application under the reasoning of Marsh , and that was precisely the state of the law after Lloyd.  The Court’s only apparent objection to this analysis is that it makes the applicability of the First Amendment turn to some degree on the subject matter of the speech.  But that in itself is no objection, and the cases cited by the Court to the effect that government may not “restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content,” Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972), are simply inapposite.

 Indeed, the Court of Appeals quite clearly viewed the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation and the Board’s decision as statutorily based.  And the court did not even make the factual finding of functional equivalence to a business district that it recognized as a prerequisite to the application of the First Amendment.  501 F. 2d, at 164 .  It is irrelevant, in my view, that the property in this case was owned by the shopping center owner rather than by the employer.  The nature of the property interest is the same in either case. The only alternative means of communication referred to in Babcock & Wilcox were “personal contacts on streets or at home, telephones, letters or advertised meetings to get in touch with the employees.” 351 U. S., at 111 .  No point would be served by adding to the observations in Logan Valley and my dissent in Lloyd with respect to the growth of suburban shopping centers and the proliferation of activities taking place in such centers.
