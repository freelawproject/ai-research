**Lead Opinion**
 Justice Breyer’s second case, Welch , overruled Parden in part, as we discuss above, and we think it quite impossible to believe that the following statement in the opinion did not “questio[n] the holding of Parden that the Court today discards,’"'post, at 698: “We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject uneonsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” 483 U. S., at 475.  Calling what a prior case has flatly decided a “question” in need of “deciding,” and (lest there be any doubt on the point) making it clear that we “intimatfe] no view” as to whether the answer given by that prior ease was correct, surely was handwriting on the wall which even an inept cryptologist would recognize as spelling out the caption of today’s opinion.  As for Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), we explain elsewhere, see infra, at 682-684, how that case was logically and practically inconsistent with Parden , even though it did not expressly overrule it.  Justice Breyer realizes this well enough, or else his call for an overruling of that case, which occupies almost half of his dissent, see post, at 699-705, would be supremely irrelevant to the matter before us.  In an attempt to cast doubt on our characterization of Parden as a groundbreaking case, Justice Beeyer points to three earlier decisions which allegedly demonstrate that Parden worked no major change.  These cases, however, have only the most tenuous relation to Parderis actual holding — as one might suspect from the dissent’s soft-pedaled description of them as “roughly comparable” and involving (in quotation marks) ‘“waivers.”’ Post, at 696.  The first two, United, States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), and California v. Taylor, <citedDecision>353 U. S. 553</citedDecision> (1957), involved neither state immunity from suit nor waiver, but the entirely different question whether substantive provisions of Commerce Clause legislation applied to the States.  The former concerned a suit brought against a State by ike United States (a situation in which state sovereign immunity does not exist, see United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892)), and the latter expressly acknowledged that “the Eleventh Amendment” was “not before us,” <citedDecision>353 U. S., at 568, n. 16</citedDecision> .  The last case, Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565 (1947), which held that a bankruptcy court can entertain a trustee’s objections to a claim filed by a State, stands for the unremarkable proposition that a State waives its sovereign immunity by voluntarily invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  See supra, at 675-676.  In sum, none of these cases laid any foundation for Parden— whose author was quite correct in acknowledging that it “presented a question of first impression,” Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 299 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  As for the suggestion of Justice Beeyer that we limit state sovereign immunity to noncommercial state activities because Congress has so limited foreign sovereign immunity, in accord with the “modern trend,” see post, at 699 (dissenting opinion) (citing the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U. S. C. 11605(a)(2)), see also Justice Stevens’s dissent, post, at 692: This proposal ignores the fact that state sovereign immunity, unlike foreign sovereign immunity, is a constitutional doctrine that is meant to be both immutable by Congress and resistant to trends.  The text of the Eleventh Amendment, of course, makes no distinction between commercial and noncommercial state activities — and so if we were to combine Justice Beeyer’s literalistic interpretation of that Amendment with his affection for FSIA, we would have a “commercial activities” exception for all suits against States except those commenced in federal court by citizens of another State, a disposition that hardly “makes sense,” post, at 699.  Justice Breyer purports to “accept this Court’s pre-Seminole Tribe sovereign immunity decisions,” post, at 699 (dissenting opinion), but by that he could not mean Hans , but rather only the distorted view of Hans that prevailed briefly between Farden and Seminole Tribe.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 A Congress that decides to regulate those state commercial activities rather than to exempt the State likely believes that an exemption, by treating the State differently from identically situated private persons, would threaten the objectives of a federal regulatory program aimed primarily *695 at private conduct.  Compare, e. g., 12 U. S. C. § 1841 (b) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (exempting state companies from regulations covering federal bank holding companies); 15 U. S. C. §77e(a)(2) (exempting state-issued securities from federal securities laws); and 29 U. S. C. § 652 (5) (exempting States from the definition of “employer[sJ” subject to federal occupational safety and health laws), with 11 U. S. C. § 106 (a) (subjecting States to federal bankruptcy court judgments); 15 U. S. C. § 1122 (a) (subjecting States to suit for violation of Lanham Act); 17 U. S. C. § 511 (a) (subjecting States to suit for copyright infringement); and 35 U. S. C. § 271 (h) (subjecting States to suit for patent infringement).  And a Congress that includes the State not only within its substantive regulatory rules but also (expressly) within a related system of private remedies likely believes that a remedial exemption would similarly threaten that program.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. Co liege Savings Bank, ante, at 656-657 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  It thereby avoids an enforcement gap which, when allied with the pressures of a competitive marketplace, could place the State’s regulated private competitors at a significant disadvantage.  These considerations make Congress’ need to possess the power to condition entry into the market upon a waiver of sovereign immunity (as “necessary and proper” to the exercise of its commerce power) unusually strong, for to deny Congress that power would deny Congress the power effectively to regulate private conduct.  Cf. California v. Taylor, <citedDecision>353 U. S. 553, 566</citedDecision> (1957).  At the same time they make a State’s need to exercise sovereign immunity unusually weak, for the State is unlikely to have to supply what private firms already supply, nor may it fairly demand special treatment, even to protect the public purse, when it does so. Neither can one easily imagine what the Constitution’s Founders would have thought about the assertion of sovereign immunity in this special context.  These considerations, differing in kind or degree from those that would support a general *696 congressional “abrogation” power, indicate that Pardens holding is sound, irrespective of this Court’s decisions in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), and Alden v. Maine, post, p. 706.  Neither did Parden break “sharply.  with prior cases.” Parden itself cited authority that found related “waivers” in at least roughly comparable circumstances.  United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), for example, held that a State, “by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has subjected itself to the commerce power,” id., at 185 , which amounted to a waiver of a (different though related) substantive immunity.  See also <citedDecision>Taylor, supra, at 568</citedDecision> .  Parden also relied on authority holding that States seeking necessary congressional approval for an interstate compact had, “by venturing into the [federal] realm 'assume[d] the [waiver of sovereign immunity] conditions .  .  .  attached.’” 377 U. S., at 196 (quoting Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm’n, 359 U. S. 275, 281-282 (1959)).  Earlier case law had found a waiver of sovereign immunity in a State’s decision to bring a creditor’s claim in bankruptcy.  See Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565, 573-574 (1947).
