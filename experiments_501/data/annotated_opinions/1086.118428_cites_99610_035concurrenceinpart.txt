**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.  I believe this Court was correct in Evans v. Gore, <citedDecision>253 U.S. 245</citedDecision> (1920), when it held that any tax that reduces a judgeâ€™s *587 net compensation violates Article III of the Constitution.  Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in its entirety.
