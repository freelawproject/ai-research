**Dissenting Opinion**
 See, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991).  Such unreflective cost-benefit analysis is inconsistent with the very idea of rights.  See generally Cover & Aleinikoff, Dialectical Federalism: Habeas Corpus and the Court, 86 Yale L. J. 1035, 1092 (1977).  The Bill of Rights is not, after all, a collection of technical interests, and “surely it is an abuse to deal too casually and too lightly with rights guaranteed” therein.  Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S., at 498 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  It is well settled that the existence of a state procedural default does not divest a federal court of jurisdiction on collateral review.  See Wainwright v. Sykes, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 72, 82-84</citedDecision> (1977).  Rather, the important office of the federal courts in vindicating federal rights gives way to the States’ enforcement of their procedural rules to protect the States’ interest in being an equal partner in safeguarding federal rights.  This accommodation furthers the values underlying federalism in two ways.  First, encouraging a defendant to assert his federal rights in the appropriate state forum makes it possible for transgressions to be arrested sooner and before they influence an erroneous deprivation of liberty.  Second, thorough examination of a prisoner’s federal claims in state court permits more effective review of those claims in federal court, honing the accuracy of the writ as an implement to eradicate unlawful detention.  See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 519 (1982); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S., at 500-501 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  The majority ignores these purposes in concluding that a State need not bear the burden of making clear its intent to rely on such a rule.
