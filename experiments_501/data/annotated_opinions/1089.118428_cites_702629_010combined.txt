 953 F. 2d 626 (CA Fed. 1992).  On remand, eight more judges joined the lawsuit.  They contested the extension to judges of the Medicare tax as well.  The Court of Federal Claims held against the judges on the merits.  31 Fed. Cl. 436 (1994).  The Federal Circuit reversed, ordering summary judgment for the judges as to liability.  <citedDecision>64 F. 3d 647</citedDecision> (1995).  The Government petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari.  Some Members of this Court were disqualified from hearing the matter, and we failed to find a quorum of six Justices.  See 28 U. S. C. § 1 .  Consequently, the Court of Appeals' judgment was affirmed "with the same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided court." 519 U. S. 801 (1996); see 28 U. S. C. § 2109 .  *565 On remand from the Court of Appeals, the Court of Federal Claims found (a) that the 6-year statute of limitations, see 28 U. S. C. §§ 2401 (a), 2501, barred some claims, including all Medicare claims; and (b) that, in any event, a subsequently enacted judicial salary increase promptly cured any violation, making damages minimal.  38 Fed. Cl. 166 (1997).

 See Revenue Act of 1918, § 213, 40 Stat. 1065 (defining "gross income" to include judicial salaries).  In Evans itself, the Court held that the Compensation Clause barred application of the tax to Evans, who had been appointed a judge before Congress enacted the tax. 253 U. S., at 264 .  A few years later, the Court extended Evans , making clear that its rationale covered not only judges appointed before Congress enacted a tax but also judges whose appointments took place after the tax had become law. See Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501, 509 (1925).  Fourteen years after deciding Miles , this Court overruled Miles.  O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277 (1939).  But, *567 as the Court of Appeals noted, this Court did not expressly overrule Evans itself.  <citedDecision>64 F. 3d, at 650</citedDecision> .  The Court of Appeals added that, if "changes in judicial doctrine" had significantly undermined Evans ` holding, this "Court itself would have overruled the case." Ibid. Noting that this case is like Evans (involving judges appointed before enactment of the tax), not like O'Malley (involving judges appointed after enactment of the tax), the Court of Appeals held that Evans controlled the outcome.  <citedDecision>64 F. 3d, at 650</citedDecision> .  Hence application of both Medicare and Social Security taxes to these pre enactment judges violated the Compensation Clause.  The Court of Appeals was correct in applying Evans to the instant case, given that "it is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents." State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 20 (1997); see also Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).  Nonetheless, the court below, in effect, has invited us to reconsider Evans .  We now overrule Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before enactment of the tax. The Court's opinion in Evans began by explaining why the Compensation Clause is constitutionally important, and we begin by reaffirming that explanation.  As Evans points out, 253 U. S., at 251-252 , the Compensation Clause, along with the Clause securing federal judges appointments "during good Behavior," U. S. Const., Art. III, § 1the practical equivalent of life tenurehelps to guarantee what Alexander Hamilton called the "complete independence of the courts of justice."

 253 U. S., at 254 .  Otherwise a legislature could circumvent even the most basic Compensation Clause protection by enacting a discriminatory tax law, for example, that precisely but indirectly achieved the forbidden effect.  Nonetheless, we disagree with Evans ` application of Compensation Clause principles to the matter before ita nondiscriminatory tax that treated judges the same way it treated other citizens.  Evans' basic holding was that the *570 Compensation Clause forbids such a tax because the Clause forbids "all diminution," including "taxation," "whether for one purpose or another." Id., at 255 .  The Federal Circuit relied upon this holding.  <citedDecision>64 F. 3d, at 650</citedDecision> .  But, in our view, it is no longer sound law. For one thing, the dissenters in Evans cast the majority's reasoning into doubt.  Justice Holmes, joined by Justice Brandeis, wrote that the Compensation Clause offers "no reason for exonerating" a judge "from the ordinary duties of a citizen, which he shares with all others.  To require a man to pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot possibly be made an instrument to attack his independence as a judge." 253 U. S., at 265 .  Holmes analogized the "diminution" that a tax might bring about to the burden that a state law might impose upon interstate commerce.  If "there was no discrimination against such commerce the tax constituted one of the ordinary burdens of government from which parties were not exempted." Id., at 267 .
