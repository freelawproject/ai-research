Third. Except in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the State. And whether the law of the State shall be declared by its Legislature in a statute or by its highest court in a decision is not a matter of federal concern. There is no federal general common law. Congress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a State whether they be local in their nature or "general," be they commercial law or a part of the law of torts. And no clause in the Constitution purports to confer such a power upon the federal courts. As stated by Mr. Justice Field when protesting in Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Baugh, <targetCase>149 U.S. 368</targetCase> , 401, against ignoring the Ohio common law of fellow servant liability: "I am aware that what has been termed the general law of the country  which is often little less than what the judge advancing the doctrine thinks at the time should be the general law on a particular subject  has been often advanced in judicial opinions of this court to control a conflicting law of a State. I admit that learned judges have fallen into the habit of repeating this doctrine as a convenient mode of brushing aside the law of a State in conflict with their views. And I confess that, moved and governed by the authority of the great names of those judges, I have, myself, in many instances, unhesitatingly and confidently, but I think now erroneously, repeated the same doctrine. But, notwithstanding the great names which may be cited in favor of the doctrine, and notwithstanding the frequency with which the doctrine has been reiterated, there stands, as a perpetual protest against its repetition, the Constitution of the United States, which recognizes and preserves the autonomy and independence of the States  independence in their legislative and independence *79 in their judicial departments. Supervision over either the legislative or the judicial action of the States is in no case permissible except as to matters by the Constitution specifically authorized or delegated to the United States. Any interference with either, except as thus permitted, is an invasion of the authority of the State and, to that extent, a denial of its independence." The fallacy underlying the rule declared in Swift v. Tyson is made clear by Mr. Justice Holmes.
**Combined Opinion**
It never has been supposed by us, that the section did apply, or was designed to apply, to questions of a more general nature, not at all dependent upon local statutes or local usages of a fixed and permanent operation, as, for example, to the construction of ordinary contracts or other written instruments, and especially to questions of general commercial law, where the state tribunals are called upon to perform the like functions as ourselves, that is, to ascertain upon general reasoning and legal analogies, what is the true exposition of the contract or instrument, or what is the just rule furnished by the principles of commercial law to govern the case. And we have not now the slightest difficulty in holding, that this section, upon its true intendment and construction, is strictly limited to local statutes and local usages of the character *84 before stated, and does not extend to contracts and other instruments of a commercial nature, the true interpretation and effect whereof are to be sought, not in the decisions of the local tribunals, but in the general principles and doctrines of commercial jurisprudence. Undoubtedly, the decisions of the local tribunals upon such subjects are entitled to, and will receive, the most deliberate attention and respect of this Court; but they cannot furnish positive rules, or conclusive authority, by which our own judgments are to be bound up and governed." (Italics added.) The doctrine of that case has been followed by this Court in an unbroken line of decisions. So far as appears, it was not questioned until more than 50 years later, and then by a single judge. [1] Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Baugh, <targetCase>149 U.S. 368</targetCase> , 390. In that case, Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the Court, truly said (p. 373): "Whatever differences of opinion may have been expressed, have not been on the question whether a matter of general law should be settled by the independent judgment of this court, rather than through an adherence to the decisions of the state courts, but upon the other question, whether a given matter is one of local or of general law." And since that decision, the division of opinion in this Court has been one of the same character as it was before. In 1910, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for himself and two other Justices, dissented from the holding that a *85 court of the United States was bound to exercise its own independent judgment in the construction of a conveyance made before the state courts had rendered an authoritative decision as to its meaning and effect. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U.S. 349 . But that dissent accepted (p. 371) as "settled" the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson , and insisted (p. 372) merely that the case under consideration was by nature and necessity peculiarly local. Thereafter, as before, the doctrine was constantly applied.

Dissenting opinions were also written by Mr. Justice Daniel in Rowan v. Runnels, 5 How. 134 , 140; by Mr. Justice Nelson in Williamson v. Berry, 8 How. 495 , 550, 558; by Mr. Justice Campbell in Pease v. Peck, 18 How. 595 , 599, 600; and by Mr. Justice Miller in Gelpcke v. City of Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175 , 207, and Butz v. City of Muscatine, 8 Wall. 575 , 585. Vigorous attack upon the entire doctrine was made by Mr. Justice Field in Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Baugh, <targetCase>149 U.S. 368</targetCase> , 390, and by Mr. Justice Holmes in Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U.S. 349 , 370, and in the Taxicab case, 276 U.S. at 532 . [2] In Hawkins v. Barney's Lessee, 5 Pet. 457 , 464, it was stated that § 34 "has been uniformly held to be no more than a declaration of what the law would have been without it: to wit, that the lex loci must be the governing rule of private right, under whatever jurisdiction private right comes to be examined." See also Bank of Hamilton v. Dudley's Lessee, 2 Pet. 492 , 525. Compare Jackson v. Chew, 12 Wheat. 153 , 162, 168; Livingston v. Moore, 7 Pet.
