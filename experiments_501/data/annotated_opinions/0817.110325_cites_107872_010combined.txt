**Combined Opinion**
 The exclusionary rule is one form of remedy afforded for Fourth Amendment violations, and the Court in Jones v. United States held that the Hatch v. Reardon principle properly limited its availability.  The Court reasoned that ordinarily "it is entirely proper to require of one who seeks to challenge the legality of a search as the basis for suppressing relevant evidence that he .  .  .  establish, that he himself was the victim of an invasion of privacy." 362 U. S., at 261 .  Subsequent attempts to vicariously assert violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of others have been repeatedly rejected by this Court. Alderman v. United States, <citedDecision>394 U. S. 165, 174</citedDecision> (1969); Brown v. United States, 411 U. S. *87 223, 230 (1973).  Most recently, in Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128 (1978), we held that "it is proper to permit only defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated to benefit from the [exclusionary] rule's protections." Id., at 134 .  Even though the Court in Jones recognized that the exclusionary rule should only be available to protect defendants who have been the victims of an illegal search or seizure, the Court thought it necessary to establish an exception.  In cases where possession of the seized evidence was an essential element of the offense charged, the Court held that the defendant was not obligated to establish that his own Fourth Amendment rights had been violated, but only that the search and seizure of the evidence was unconstitutional.  [3] Upon such a showing, the exclusionary rule would be available to prevent the admission of the evidence against the defendant.  The Court found that the prosecution of such possessory offenses presented a "special problem" which necessitated the departure from the then settled principles of Fourth Amendment "standing."
**Combined Opinion**
 C Even though the original foundations of Jones are no longer relevant, respondents assert that principles not articulated by the Court in Jones support retention of the rule.  First, respondents maintain that while Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377 (1968), eliminated the possibility that the prosecutor could use a defendant's testimony at a suppression hearing as substantive evidence of guilt at trial, Simmons did not eliminate other risks to the defendant which attach to giving testimony on a motion to suppress.  [7] Principally, respondents assert that the prosecutor may still be permitted to use the defendant's testimony to impeach him at trial. [8] This Court *94 has not decided whether Simmons precludes the use of a defendant's testimony at a suppression hearing to impeach his testimony at trial. [9] But the issue presented here is quite different from the one of whether "use immunity" extends only through the Government's case-in-chief, or beyond that to the direct and cross-examination of a defendant in the event he chooses to take the stand.  That issue need not be and is not resolved here, for it is an issue which more aptly relates to the proper breadth of the Simmons privilege, and not to the need for retaining automatic standing.  Respondents also seek to retain the Jones rule on the grounds that it is said to maximize the deterrence of illegal police conduct by permitting an expanded class of potential challengers.  The same argument has been rejected by this Court as a sufficient basis for allowing persons whose Fourth Amendment rights were not violated to nevertheless claim the benefits of the exclusionary rule.  In <citedDecision>Alderman</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>394 U. S., at 174-175</citedDecision> , we explicitly stated: "The deterrent values of preventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated have been considered sufficient to justify the suppression of probative evidence even though the case against the defendant is weakened or destroyed.  We adhere to that judgment.  But we are not convinced that the additional benefits of extending the exclusionary rule to other defendants would justify further encroachment upon the public interest in prosecuting those accused of crime and having them acquitted or convicted on the basis of all the evidence which exposes the truth." See also Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S., at 137 ; United States v. Ceccolini, 435 U. S. 268, 275-276 (1978); United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 350-351 (1974).  Respondents' deterrence *95 argument carries no special force in the context of possessory offenses and we therefore again reject it.  We are convinced that the automatic standing rule of Jones has outlived its usefulness in this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  The doctrine now serves only to afford a windfall to defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights have not been violated.  We are unwilling to tolerate the exclusion of probative evidence under such circumstances since we adhere to the view of <citedDecision>Alderman</citedDecision> that the values of the Fourth Amendment are preserved by a rule which limits the availability of the exclusionary rule to defendants who have been subjected to a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights.  This action comes to us as a challenge to a pretrial decision suppressing evidence.  The respondents relied on automatic standing and did not attempt to establish that they had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the areas of Zackular's mother's home where the goods were seized.  We therefore think it appropriate to remand so that respondents will have an opportunity to demonstrate, if they can, that their own Fourth Amendment rights were violated.  See Combs v. United States, 408 U. S. 224 (1972).  Reversed and remanded.  MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.

 (Emphasis added.) [6]  Legal possession of the seized good may be sufficient in some circumstances to entitle a defendant to seek the return of the seized property if the seizure, as opposed to the search, was illegal.  See, e. g., United States v. Lisk, 522 F. 2d 228 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.), cert. denied, 423 U. S. 1078 (1976), although in that case the property was ultimately found not to have been illegally seized.  We need not explore this issue since respondents did not challenge the constitutionality of the seizure of the evidence.  [7]  The respondents argue that the prosecutor's access to the suppression testimony will unfairly provide the prosecutor with information advantageous to the preparation of his case and trial strategy.  This argument, however, is surely applicable equally to possessory and nonpossessory offenses.  This Court has clearly declined to expand the Jones rule to other classes of offenses, Alderman v. United States, <citedDecision>394 U. S. 165</citedDecision> (1969); Brown v. United States, 411 U. S. 223 (1973), and thus respondents' rationale cannot support the retention of a special rule of automatic standing here.  [8]  A number of courts considering the question have held that such testimony is admissible as evidence of impeachment.  Gray v. State, 43 Md. App. 238 , 403 A. 2d 853 (1979); People v. Douglas, 66 Cal. App. 3d 998 , 136 Cal. Rptr. 358 (1977); People v. Sturgis, 58 Ill. 2d 211 , 317 N. E. 2d 545 (1974).  See also Woody v. United States, 126 U. S. App. D. C. 353, 354-355, 379 F. 2d 130, 131-132 (Burger, J.), cert. denied, 389 U. S. 961 (1967).  [9]  This Court has held that "the protective shield of Simmons is not to be converted into a license for false representations.  .  .
