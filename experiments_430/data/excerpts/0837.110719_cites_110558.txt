 The court reasoned: “No specific, well-delineated exception called to our attention permits the police to dispense with a warrant to open and search ‘unworthy’ containers.  Moreover, we believe that a rule under which the validity of a war-rantless search would turn on judgments about the durability of a container would impose an unreasonable and unmanageable burden on police and courts.  For these reasons, and because the Fourth Amendment protects all persons, not just those with the resources or fastidiousness to place their effects in containers that decision-makers would rank in the luggage line, we hold that the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement forbids the warrantless opening of a closed, opaque paper bag to the same extent that it forbids the warrantless opening of a small unlocked suitcase or a zippered leather pouch.” 210 U. S. App. D. C. 342, 344, 655 F. 2d 1159, 1161 (1981) (footnote omitted).  *803 The en banc Court of Appeals considered, and rejected, the argument that it was reasonable for the police to open both the paper bag and the leather pouch because they were entitled to conduct a warrantless search of the entire vehicle in which the two containers were found. The majority concluded that this argument was foreclosed by Sanders .  Three dissenting judges interpreted Sanders differently.  3 Other courts also have read the Sanders opinion in different ways.  4 Moreover, disagreement concerning the proper interpretation of Sanders was at least partially responsible for the fact that Robbins v. California, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 420</citedDecision> , was decided last Term without a Court opinion.  There is, however, no dispute among judges about the importance of striving for clarification in this area of the law. For countless vehicles are stopped on highways and public *804 streets every day, and our cases demonstrate that it is not uncommon for police officers to have probable cause to believe that contraband may be found in a stopped vehicle.  In every such case a conflict is presented between the individual’s constitutionally protected interest in privacy and the public interest in effective law enforcement.  No single rule of law can resolve every conflict, but our conviction that clarification is feasible led us to grant the Government’s petition for certiorari in this case and to invite the parties to address the question whether the decision in <citedDecision>Robbins</citedDecision> should be reconsidered.  454 U. S. 891 .  II We begin with a review of the decision m Carroll itself.  In the fall of 1921, federal prohibition agents obtained evidence that George Carroll and John Kiro were “bootleggers” who frequently traveled between Grand Rapids and Detroit in an Oldsmobile Roadster.  5 On December 15, 1921, the agents unexpectedly encountered Carroll and Kiro driving west on that route in that car. The officers gave pursuit, stopped the roadster on the highway, and directed Carroll and Kiro to get out of the car. No contraband was visible in the front seat of the Oldsmobile and the rear portion of the roadster was closed.  One of the agents raised the rumble seat but found no liquor.  He raised the seat cushion and again found nothing.

 The relationship between the automobile and the contraband was purely coincidental, as in Chadwick .  The fact that the suitcase was resting in the trunk of the automobile at the time of respondent’s arrest does not turn this into an ‘automobile’ exception case. The Court need say no more.” 442 U. S., at 766-767 .  The Court in Sanders did not, however, rest its decision solely on the authority of Chadwick .  In rejecting the State’s *814 argument that the warrantless search of the suitcase was justified on the ground that it had been taken from an automobile lawfully stopped on the street, the Court broadly suggested that a warrantless search of a container found in an automobile could never be sustained as part of a warrantless search of the automobile itself.  19 The Court did not suggest that it mattered whether probable cause existed to search the entire vehicle.  It is clear, however, that in neither Chadwick nor Sanders did the police have probable cause to search the vehicle or anything within it except the footlocker in the former case and the green suitcase in the latter.  Robbins v. California, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 420</citedDecision> , however, was a case in which suspicion was not directed at a specific container.  In that case the Court for the first time was forced to consider whether police officers who are entitled to conduct a warrantless search of an automobile stopped on a public roadway may open a container found within the vehicle.  In the early morning of January 5, 1975, police officers stopped Robbins’ station wagon because he was driving erratically.  Robbins got out of the car, but later returned to obtain the vehicle’s registration papers.  When he opened the car door, the officers smelled marihuana smoke.  One of the officers searched Robbins and discovered a vial of liquid; in a search of the interior of the car the officer found marihuana.  The police officers then opened the tailgate of the station wagon and raised the cover of a recessed luggage compartment.
**Lead Opinion**
 Robbins was charged with various drug offenses and moved to suppress the contents of the plastic packages.  The California Court of Appeal held that “[s]earch of the automobile was proper when the officers learned that appellant was smoking marijuana when they stopped him” 20 and that the warrantless search of the packages was justified because “the contents of the packages could have been inferred from their outward appearance, so that appellant could not have held a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the contents.” People v. Robbins, 103 Cal. App. 3d 34, 40 , 162 Cal. Rptr. 780, 783 (1980).  This Court reversed.  Writing for a plurality, Justice Stewart rejected the argument that the outward appearance of the packages precluded Robbins from having a reasonable expectation of privacy in their contents.  He also squarely rejected the argument that there is a constitutional distinction between searches of luggage and searches of “less worthy” containers.  Justice Stewart reasoned that all containers are equally protected by the Fourth Amendment unless their contents are in plain view.  The plurality concluded that the warrantless search was impermissible because Chadwick and Sanders had established that “a closed piece of luggage found in a lawfully searched car is constitutionally protected to the same extent as are closed pieces of luggage found anywhere else.” <citedDecision>453 U. S., at 425</citedDecision> .  In an opinion concurring in the judgment, JUSTICE POWELL, the author of the Court’s opinion in Sanders , stated that “[t]he plurality’s approach strains the rationales of our prior cases and imposes substantial burdens on law enforcement without vindicating any significant values of privacy.” <citedDecision>453 *816U.  S., at 429</citedDecision> .  21 He noted that possibly “the controlling question should be the scope of the automobile exception to the warrant requirement,” <citedDecision>id., at 435</citedDecision> , and explained that under that view “when the police have probable cause to search an automobile, rather than only to search a particular container that fortuitously is located in it, the exigencies that allow the police to search the entire automobile without a warrant support the warrantless search of every container found therein.  See post, at 451, and n. 13 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This analysis is entirely consistent with the holdings in Chadwick and Sanders , neither of which is an ‘automobile case,’ because the police there had probable cause to search the double-locked footlocker and the suitcase respectively before either came near an automobile.” Ibid. The parties in Robbins had not pressed that argument, how *817 ever, and Justice Powell concluded that institutional constraints made it inappropriate to reexamine basic doctrine without full adversary presentation.  He concurred in the judgment, since it was supported — although not compelled— by the Court’s opinion in Sanders , and stated that a future case might present a better opportunity for thorough consideration of the basic principles in this troubled area.  That case has arrived.  Unlike Chadwick and Sanders , in this case police officers had probable cause to search respondent’s entire vehicle.  22 Unlike Robbins, in this case the parties have squarely addressed the question whether, in the course of a legitimate warrantless search of an automobile, police are entitled to open containers found within the vehicle.

 27 Thus, a warrant that authorizes an officer to search a home for illegal weapons also provides authority to open closets, chests, drawers, and containers in which the weapon might be found. A warrant to open a footlocker to search for marihuana would also authorize the opening of packages found inside.  A warrant to search a vehicle would support a search of every part of the vehicle that might contain the object of the search.  When a legitimate search is under way, and when its purpose and its limits have been precisely defined, nice distinctions between closets, drawers, and containers, in the case of a home, or between glove compartments, upholstered seats, trunks, and wrapped packages, in the case of a vehicle, must give way to the interest in the prompt and efficient completion of the task at hand. 28 *822 This rule applies equally to all containers, as indeed we believe it must.  One point on which the Court was in virtually unanimous agreement in Robbins was that a constitutional distinction between “worthy” and “unworthy” containers would be improper.  29 Even though such a distinction perhaps could evolve in a series of cases in which paper bags, locked trunks, lunch buckets, and orange crates were placed on one side of the line or the other, 30 the central purpose of the Fourth Amendment forecloses such a distinction.  For just as the most frail cottage in the kingdom is absolutely entitled to the same guarantees of privacy as the most majestic mansion, 31 so also may a traveler who carries a toothbrush and a few articles of clothing in a paper bag or knotted scarf claim an equal right to conceal his possessions from official inspection as the sophisticated executive with the locked attaché case. As Justice Stewart stated in Robbins, the Fourth Amendment provides protection to the owner of every container *823 that conceals its contents from plain view.  <citedDecision>453 U. S., at 427</citedDecision> (plurality opinion).  But the protection afforded by the Amendment varies in different settings.  The luggage carried by a traveler entering the country may be searched at random by a customs officer; the luggage may be searched no matter how great the traveler’s desire to conceal the contents may be.  A container carried at the time of arrest often may be searched without a warrant and even without any specific suspicion concerning its contents.  A container that may conceal the object of a search authorized by a warrant may be opened immediately; the individual’s interest in privacy must give way to the magistrate’s official determination of probable cause.  In the same manner, an individual’s expectation of privacy in a vehicle and its contents may not survive if probable cause is given to believe that the vehicle is transporting contraband.  Certainly the privacy interests in a car’s trunk or glove compartment may be no less than those in a movable container.
**Lead Opinion**
 These interests must yield to the authority of a search, however, which — in light of Carroll — does not itself require the prior approval of a magistrate.  The scope of a warrantless search based on probable cause is no narrower — and no broader — than the scope of a search authorized by a warrant supported by probable cause.  Only the prior approval of the magistrate is waived; the search otherwise is as the magistrate could authorize.  32 *824 The scope of a warrantless search of an automobile thus is not defined by the nature of the container in which the contraband is secreted.  Rather, it is defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found. Just as probable cause to believe that a stolen lawnmower may be found in a garage will not support a warrant to search an upstairs bedroom, probable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not justify a warrantless search of a suitcase.  Probable cause to believe that a container placed in the trunk of a taxi contains contraband or evidence does not justify a search of the entire cab.  V Our decision today is inconsistent with the disposition in Robbins v. <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> and with the portion of the opinion in Arkansas v. Sanders on which the plurality in Robbins relied.  Nevertheless, the doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude this action.  Although we have rejected some of the reasoning in Sanders , we adhere to our holding in that case; although we reject the precise holding in Robbins, there was no Court opinion supporting a single rationale for its judgment, and the reasoning we adopt today was not presented by the parties in that case. Moreover, it is clear that no legitimate reliance interest can be frustrated by our decision today.  33 Of greatest importance, we are convinced that the rule we apply in this case is faithful to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that the Court has followed with substantial consistency throughout our history.  We reaffirm the basic rule of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence stated by Justice Stewart for a unanimous Court in Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 , 390: *825 “The Fourth Amendment proscribes all unreasonable searches and seizures, and it is a cardinal principle that ‘searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment — subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.’ Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 357 (footnotes omitted).” The exception recognized in Carroll is unquestionably one that is “specifically established and well delineated.” We hold that the scope of the warrantless search authorized by that exception is no broader and no narrower than a magistrate could legitimately authorize by warrant.  If probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

 “While the plurality’s blanket warrant requirement does not even purport to protect any privacy interest, it would impose substantial new burdens on law enforcement.  Confronted with a cigar box or a Dixie cup in the course of a probable-cause search of an automobile for narcotics, the conscientious policeman would be required to take the object to a magistrate, fill out the appropriate forms, await the decision, and finally obtain the warrant.  Suspects or vehicles normally will be detained while the warrant is sought.  This process may take hours, removing the officer from his normal police duties.  Expenditure of such time and effort, drawn from the public’s limited resources for detecting or preventing crimes, is justified when it protects an individual’s reasonable privacy interests.  In my view, the plurality’s requirement cannot be so justified.  The aggregate burden of procuring warrants whenever an officer has probable cause to search the most trivial container may be heavy and will not be compensated by the advancement of important Fourth Amendment values.” <citedDecision>453 U. S., at 433-434</citedDecision> (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  The substantial burdens on law enforcement identified by Justice Powell would, of course, not be affected by the character of the container found during an automobile search.  No comparable practical problems arise when the official suspicion is confined to a particular piece of luggage, as in Chadwick and Sanders.  Cf. n. 19, supra. The en banc Court of Appeals stated that “[biased on the tip the police received, Ross’s car was properly stopped and searched, and the pouch and bag were properly seized.” 210 U. S. App. D. C., at 361, 655 F. 2d, at 1168 (footnote omitted).  The court explained: “[W]e believe it clear that the police had ample and reasonable cause to stop Ross and to search his car. The informer had supplied accurate information on prior occasions, and he was an eyewitness to sales of narcotics by Ross.  He said he had just seen Ross take narcotics from the trunk of his car in making a sale and heard him say he possessed additional narcotics.” Id., at 361, n. 22, 655 F. 2d, at 1168, n. 22 .  The court further noted: “In this case, the informant told the police that Ross had narcotics in the trunk of his car. No specific container was identified.” Id., at 359, 655 F. 2d, at 1166 .

 ‘In countless cases in which warrants described only the land and the buildings, a search of desks, cabinets, closets and similar items has been permitted.”’ 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 152 (1978) (quoting Massey v. Commonwealth, 305 S. W. 2d 755, 756 (Ky. 1957)).  The practical considerations that justify a warrantless search of an automobile continue to apply until the entire search of the automobile and its contents has been completed.  Arguably, the entire vehicle itself (including its upholstery) could be searched without a warrant, with all wrapped articles and containers found during that search then taken to a magistrate.  But prohibiting police from opening immediately a container in which the object of the search is most likely to be found and instead forcing them first to comb the entire vehicle would actually exacerbate the intrusion on privacy interests.  Moreover, until the container itself was opened the police could never be certain that the contraband was not secreted in a yet undiscovered portion of the vehicle; thus in every case in which a container was found, the vehicle would need to be secured while a warrant was obtained.  Such a requirement would be directly inconsistent with the rationale supporting the decisions in Carroll and Chambers .  Cf. nn. 19 and 22, supra. Cf. <citedDecision>453 U. S., at 426-427</citedDecision> (plurality opinion); <citedDecision>id., at 436</citedDecision> (Blackmun, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>id., at 443</citedDecision> (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>id., at 447</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., dissenting).  If the distinction is based on the proposition that the Fourth Amendment protects only those containers that objectively manifest an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy, however, the propriety of a war-rantless search necessarily would turn on much more than the fabric of the container.  A paper bag stapled shut and marked “private” might be found to manifest a reasonable expectation of privacy, as could a cardboard box stacked on top of two pieces of heavy luggage.  The propriety of the war-rantless search seemingly would turn on an objective appraisal of all the surrounding circumstances.  " 'pjjg p00rest man may jn his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown.  It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storm may enter; the rain may enter; but the King of England cannot enter — all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement!’ ” Miller v. United States, 357 U. S. 301, 307 (quoting remarks attributed to William Pitt); cf. Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 601, n. 54 .  In choosing to search without a warrant on their own assessment of probable cause, police officers of course lose the protection that a warrant would provide to them in an action for damages brought by an individual claiming that the search was unconstitutional.

Justice Blackmun, concurring.  My dissents in prior cases have indicated my continuing dissatisfaction and discomfort with the Court’s vacillation in what is rightly described as “this troubled area.” Ante, at 817.

I adhere to the views expressed in those dissents.  It is important, however, not only for the Court as an institution, but also for law enforcement officials and defendants, that the applicable legal rules be clearly established.  Justice Stevens’ opinion for the Court now accomplishes much in this respect, and it should clarify a good bit of the confusion that has existed.  In order to have an authoritative ruling, I join the Court’s opinion and judgment.

In order to have an authoritative ruling, I join the Court's opinion and judgment.  *826 JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.  In my opinion in Robbins v. California, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 420, 429</citedDecision> (1981), concurring in the judgment, I stated that the judgment was justified, though not compelled, by the Court's opinion in Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753 (1979).  I did not agree, however, with the "bright line" rule articulated by the plurality opinion.  Rather, I repeated the view I long have held that one's "reasonable expectation of privacy" is a particularly relevant factor in determining the validity of a warrantless search.  I have recognized that, with respect to automobiles in general, this expectation can be only a limited one.  See Arkansas v. Sanders, supra, at 761 ; Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U. S. 266, 279 (1973) (POWELL, J., concurring).  I continue to think that in many situations one's reasonable expectation of privacy may be a decisive factor in a search case. It became evident last Term, however, from the five opinions written in Robbins  in none of which THE CHIEF JUSTICE joined  that it is essential to have a Court opinion in automobile search cases that provides "specific guidance to police and courts in this recurring situation." Robbins v. <citedDecision>California, supra, at 435</citedDecision> (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court's opinion today, written by JUSTICE STEVENS and now joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and four other Justices, will afford this needed guidance.  It is fair also to say that, given Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925), and Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 (1970), the Court's decision does not depart substantially from Fourth Amendment doctrine in automobile cases. Moreover, in enunciating a readily understood and applied rule, today's decision is consistent with the similar step taken last Term in New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981).  I join the Court's opinion.  JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.  I would not overrule Robbins v. California, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 420</citedDecision> (1981).  For the reasons stated by Justice Stewart in that *827 case, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I also agree with much of JUSTICE MARSHALL's dissent in this case. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.  The majority today not only repeals all realistic limits on warrantless automobile searches, it repeals the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement itself.  By equating a police officer's estimation of probable cause with a magistrate's, the Court utterly disregards the value of a neutral and detached magistrate.  For as we recently, and unanimously, reaffirmed: "The warrant traditionally has represented an independent assurance that a search and arrest will not proceed without probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the person or place named in the warrant is involved in the crime.  Thus, an issuing magistrate must meet two tests.
**Combined Opinion**
 After all, what justifies the warrantless search is not probable cause alone, but probable cause coupled with the mobility of the automobile.  Because the scope of a warrantless search should depend on the scope of the justification for dispensing with a warrant, the entire premise of the majority's opinion fails to support its conclusion.  The majority's rule masks the startling assumption that a policeman's determination of probable cause is the functional equivalent of the determination of a neutral and detached magistrate.  This assumption ignores a major premise of the warrant requirement  the importance of having a neutral and detached magistrate determine whether probable cause exists.  See supra, at 828-829.  The majority's explanation that the scope of the warrantless automobile search will be "limited" to what a magistrate could authorize is thus inconsistent with our cases, which firmly establish that an on-the-spot *834 determination of probable cause is never the same as a decision by a neutral and detached magistrate.  C Our recent decisions in United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977), Arkansas v. Sanders, supra , and Robbins v. California, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 420</citedDecision> (1981), clearly affirm that movable containers are different from automobiles for Fourth Amendment purposes.  In Chadwick , the Court drew a constitutional distinction between luggage and automobiles in terms of substantial differences in expectations of privacy.  433 U. S., at 12 .  Moreover, the Court held that the mobility of such containers does not justify dispensing with a warrant, since federal agents had seized the luggage and safely transferred it to their custody under their exclusive control.  Sanders explicitly held that "the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies to personal luggage taken from an automobile to the same degree it applies to such luggage in other locations." 442 U. S., at 766 .  And Robbins reaffirmed the Sanders rationale as applied to wrapped packages found in the unlocked luggage compartment of a vehicle.
**Combined Opinion**
 Alternatively, the majority may be suggesting that Chadwick and Sanders may be explained because the connection of the container to the vehicle was incidental in these two cases. That is, because police had pre-existing probable cause to seize and search the containers, they were not entitled to wait until the item was placed in a vehicle to take advantage of the automobile exception.  Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971); 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 519-525 (1978).  I wholeheartedly agree that police cannot employ a pretext to escape Fourth Amendment prohibitions and cannot rely on an exigency that they could easily have avoided.  This interpretation, however, might well be an exception that swallows up the majority's rule.  In neither Chadwick nor Sanders did the Court suggest that the delay of the police was a pretext for taking advantage of the automobile exception.  For all that appears, the Government may have had legitimate reasons for not searching as soon as they had probable cause.  In any event, asking police to rely *841 on such an uncertain line in distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate searches for containers in automobiles hardly indicates that the majority's approach has brought clarification to this area of the law. Ante, at 804; see Robbins, <citedDecision>453 U. S., at 435</citedDecision> (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment).  [11] III The Court today ignores the clear distinction that Chadwick established between movable containers and automobiles.  It also rejects all of the relevant reasoning of Sanders [12] and offers a substitute rationale that appears inconsistent with the result.  See supra, at 832.  Sanders is therefore effectively overruled.  And the Court unambiguously overrules "the disposition" of Robbins, ante, at 824, though it gingerly avoids stating that it is overruling the case itself.  The only convincing explanation I discern for the majority's broad rule is expediency: it assists police in conducting *842 automobile searches, ensuring that the private containers into which criminal suspects often place goods will no longer be a Fourth Amendment shield.
**Combined Opinion**
 I do not understand the Court to address the applicability of the automobile exception rule announced today to parked cars.  Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971).  [2]  The fact that the police are able initially to remove the occupants from the car does not remove the justification for an immediate search.  If police could not conduct an immediate search of a stopped automobile, they would often be left with the difficult task of deciding what to do with the occupants while a warrant is obtained.  In the case of a parked automobile, by contrast, if the automobile is unoccupied, this problem is not presented.  See, e. g., Coolidge v. New Hampshire, supra .  [3]  The plurality stated: "[ Chadwick and Sanders ] made clear, if it was not clear before, that a closed piece of luggage found in a lawfully searched car is constitutionally protected to the same extent as are closed pieces of luggage found anywhere else." Robbins v. California, <citedDecision>453 U. S., at 425</citedDecision> .  [4]  This rule may present some line-drawing problems, but no greater than those presented when a movable container is in the arms of a citizen walking down the street.  There is no justification for relying on marginal difficulties of definition to reject a warrant requirement in one situation but not the other.  [5]  The Government argues that less secure containers such as paper bags can easily spill their contents; thus, no privacy interest of the defendant is protected if police are required to seize the container and bring it to the station.  Whatever the force of this argument in other contexts, here police succeeded in reclosing the bag after the initial search and transporting it to the station without incident.  [6]  The Court in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925), seems to have assumed that the police could not arrest the occupants of the automobile, since the offense was a misdemeanor and was not deemed to have been committed in the officers' presence.  See 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 511 (1978).
