**Dissenting Opinion**
 5 Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra, at 386; Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265, 284 (1977); Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 401-402 (1948); Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 434 (1920).  But the concept expressed by the “ownership” doctrine is not obsolete.  Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra, at 392 (Burger, C. J., concurring).  This Court long has recognized that the ownership *342 language of Geer and similar cases is simply a shorthand way of describing a State’s substantial interest in preserving and regulating the exploitation of the fish and game and other natural resources within its boundaries for the benefit of its citizens.  436 U. S., at 386 ; Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 284; Toomer v. Witsell, supra, at 402 .  In recognition of this important state interest, the Court has upheld a variety of regulations designed to conserve and maintain the natural resources of a State.  See, e. g., Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra; Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440 (1960); Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, <citedDecision>263 U. S. 545</citedDecision> (1924); Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 138 (1914); Geer v. Connecticut, supra; Manchester v. Massachusetts, 139 U. S. 240 (1891); McCready v. Virginia, 94 U. S. 391 (1877); Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71 (1855).  To be sure, a State’s power to preserve and regulate wildlife within its borders is not absolute.  6 But the State is accorded wide latitude in fashioning regulations appropriate for protection of its wildlife.  Unless the regulation directly conflicts with a federal statute or treaty, Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 283-285; Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529, 546 (1976); Missouri v. Holland, supra, at 434 ; allocates access in a manner that violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm’n, 334 U. S. 410 (1948); or represents a naked attempt to discriminate against out-of-state enterprises in favor of in-state businesses unrelated to any purpose of conservation, Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1, 13 (1928), the State’s special interest in preserving its wild *343 life should prevail.  And this is true no matter how “Bal-kanized” the resulting pattern of commercial activity.  7 The Oklahoma law at issue in this case serves the special interest of the State, as representative of its citizens, in preserving and regulating exploitation of free-swimming minnows found within its waters.  “[T]he law serve [s] to protect against the depletion of minnows in Oklahoma’s natural streams through commercial exportation.” 572 P. 2d 573, 575 (Okla. Crim. App. 1977).
