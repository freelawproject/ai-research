Case of interest: Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission (1919)

In the former the court *472 said (p. 245): "Interstate movement [of natural gas being transported from State to State] ended when the gas passed into local mains." In the latter, it was said (p. 308): "With the delivery of the gas [transported from one State to another] to the distributing companies . . . the interstate movement ends. Its subsequent sale and delivery by these companies to their customers at retail is intrastate business and subject to state regulation. . . . In such case the effect on interstate commerce, if there be any, is indirect and incidental . . . [p. 309]. The business of supplying, on d
