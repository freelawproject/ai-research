 Relying on arguments that conservative judges have repeatedly rejected in past cases, the Court today — despite its disclaimer to the contrary, ibid.— enlarges the scope of the automobile exception to this “cardinal principle,” which un-dergirded our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence prior to the retirement of the author of the landmark opinion in United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977).  As a preface to my response to the Court’s arguments, it is appropriate to restate the basis for the warrant requirement, the significance of the Chadwick case, and the reasons why the limitations on the automobile exception that were articulated in United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 (1982), represent a fair accom *586 modation between the basic rule requiring prior judicial approval of searches and the automobile exception.  ► — I The Fourth Amendment is a restraint on Executive power.  The Amendment constitutes the Framers’ direct constitutional response to the unreasonable law enforcement practices employed by agents of the British Crown.  See Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 389-391 (1914); Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 624-625 (1886); 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 3-5 (2d ed. 1987).  Over the years—particularly in the period immediately after World War II and particularly in opinions authored by Justice Jackson after his service as a special prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials — the Court has recognized the importance of this restraint as a bulwark against police practices that prevail in totalitarian regimes.  See, e. g., United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 595 (1948); Johnson v. United States, <citedDecision>333 U. S. 10, 17</citedDecision> (1948).  This history is, however, only part of the explanation for the warrant requirement.  The requirement also reflects the sound policy judgment that, absent exceptional circumstances, the decision to invade the privacy of an individual’s personal effects should be made by a neutral magistrate rather than an agent of the Executive.  In his opinion for the Court in <citedDecision>Johnson</citedDecision> v. United States, id., at 13-14, Justice Jackson explained: “The point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence.  Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.” Our decisions have always acknowledged that the warrant requirement imposes a burden on law enforcement.  And our *587 cases have not questioned that trained professionals normally make rehable assessments of the existence of probable cause to conduct a search.  We have repeatedly held, however, that these factors are outweighed by the individual interest in privacy that is protected by advance judicial approval.  The Fourth Amendment dictates that the privacy interest is paramount, no matter how marginal the risk of error might be if the legality of warrantless searches were judged only after the fact.  In the concluding paragraph of his opinion in Chadwick , Chief Justice Burger made the point this way: “Even though on this record the issuance of a warrant by a judicial officer was reasonably predictable, a line must be drawn.  In our view, when no exigency is shown to support the need for an immediate search, the Warrant Clause places the line at the point where the property to be searched comes under the exclusive dominion of police authority.

No impartial observer could criticize this Court for hindering the progress of the war on drugs.  On the contrary, decisions like the one the Court makes today will support the conclusion that this Court has become a loyal foot soldier in the Executive’s fight against crime.  Even if the warrant requirement does inconvenience the police to some extent, that fact does not distinguish this constitutional requirement from any other procedural protection secured by the Bill of Rights.  It is merely a part of the price that our society must pay in order to preserve its freedom.  Thus, in a unanimous opinion that relied on both <citedDecision>Johnson</citedDecision> and Chadwick , Justice Stewart wrote: “Moreover, the mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment.  Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, [ 403 U. S. 443, 481 (1971)].  The investigation of crime would always be simplified if warrants were unnecessary.  But the Fourth Amendment reflects the view of those who wrote the Bill of Rights that the privacy of a person’s home and property may not be totally sacrificed in the name of maximum simplicity in enforcement of the criminal law. See United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 6-11 .” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S., at 393 .  *602 It is too early to know how much freedom America has lost today.  The magnitude of the loss is, however, not nearly as significant as the Court’s willingness to inflict it without even a colorable basis for its rejection of prior law. 1 respectfully dissent.  “Although the searches and seizures which deeply concerned the colonists, and which were foremost in the minds of the Framers, were those involving invasions of the home, it would be a mistake to conclude, as the Government contends, that the Warrant Clause was therefore intended to guard only against intrusions into the home.  First, the Warrant Clause does not in terms distinguish between searches conducted in private homes and other searches.  There is also a strong historical connection between *588 the Warrant Clause and the initial clause of the Fourth Amendment, which draws no distinctions among ‘persons, houses, papers, and effects’ in safeguarding against unreasonable searches and seizures.” United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S., at 8 .  “The judicial warrant has a significant role to play in that it provides the detached scrutiny of a neutral magistrate, which is a more reliable safeguard against improper searches than the hurried judgment of a law enforcement officer ‘engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.’ Johnson v. United States, <citedDecision>333 U. S. 10, 14</citedDecision> (1948).  Once a lawful search has begun, it is also far more likely that it will not exceed proper bounds when it is done pursuant to a judicial authorization ‘particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.’ Further, a warrant assures the individual whose property is searched or seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer, his need to search, and the limits of his power to search.” Id., at 9.  See id., at 10-11.  The earliest case cited by Chief Justice Burger was Justice Field’s opinion in Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733 (1878).  “Having probable cause to believe that .contraband was being driven away in the taxi, the police were justified in stopping the vehicle, searching it on the spot, and seizing the suitcase they suspected contained contraband.  See Chambers v. Maroney, [ 399 U. S. 42, 52 (1970)].  At oral argument, respondent conceded that the stopping of the taxi and the seizure of the suitcase were constitutionally unobjectionable.
