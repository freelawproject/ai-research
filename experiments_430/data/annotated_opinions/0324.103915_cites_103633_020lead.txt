 The latter was designed “to indicate what the original cost of the property would have been if 1938 material and labor prices had prevailed throughout the whole period of the piecemeal construction of the company’s property since 1898.” 44 P. IT.  R. (N. S.), pp. 8-9.  Hope estimated by the “per cent condition” method accrued depreciation at about 35% of *597 reproduction cost new.  On that basis Hope contended for a rate base of $66,000,000.  The Commission refused to place any reliance on reproduction cost new, saying that it was “not predicated upon facts” and was “too conjectural and illusory to be given any weight in these proceedings.” Id., p. 8.  It likewise refused to give any “probative value” to trended “original cost” since it was “not founded in fact” but was “basically erroneous” and produced “irrational results.” Id., p. 9.  In determining the amount of accrued depletion and depreciation the Commission, following Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 292 U. S. 151, 167-169 ; Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., <citedDecision>315 U. S. 575, 592-593</citedDecision> , based its computation on “actual legitimate cost.” It found that Hope during the years when its business was not under regulation did not observe “sound depreciation and depletion practices” but “actually accumulated an excessive reserve” 4 of about $46,000,000.  Id., p. 18.  One member of the Commission thought that the entire amount of the reserve should be deducted from “actual legitimate cost” in determining the rate base.  5 The majority of the *598 Commission concluded, however, that where, as here, a business is brought under regulation for the first time and where incorrect depreciation and depletion practices have prevailed, the deduction of the reserve requirement (actual existing depreciation and depletion) rather than the excessive reserve should be made so as to lay “a sound basis for future regulation and control of rates.” Id., p. 18.  As we have pointed out, it determined accrued depletion and depreciation to be $22,328,016; and it allowed approximately $1,460,000 as the annual operating expense for depletion and depreciation.  6 Hope’s estimate of original cost was about $69,735,-000 — approximately $17,000,000 more than the amount found by the Commission.  The item of $17,000,000 was made up largely of expenditures which prior to December 31, 1938, were charged to operating expenses.

 Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 134 .  The fixing of prices, like other applications of the police power, may reduce the value of the property which is being regulated.  But the fact that the value is reduced does not mean that the regulation is invalid.  Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135, 155-157 ; Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502 , 523-539 and cases cited.  It does, however, indicate that “fair value” is the end product of the process of rate-making not the starting point as the Circuit Court of Appeals held.  The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to depend upon “fair value” when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated.  9 *602 We held in <citedDecision>Federal Power Commission</citedDecision> v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., supra, that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of for-mulae in determining rates.  Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of “pragmatic adjustments.” Id., p. 586.  And when the Commission’s order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order “viewed in its entirety” meets the requirements of the Act.  Id., p. 686.  Under the statutory standard of “just and reasonable” it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling.  Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 289 U. S. 287, 304-305, 314 ; West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 1), 294 U. S. 63, 70 ; West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 295 U. S. 662, 692-693 (dissenting opinion).  It is not theory but the impact of the rate order which counts.

 Reversed.  Mr. Justice Roberts took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. Opinion of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Murphy: We agree with the Court’s opinion and would add nothing to what has been said but for what is patently a wholly gratuitous assertion as to Constitutional law in the dissent of Mr. Justice Frankfurter.  We refer to the statement that “Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, supra, may fairly be claimed.” That was the case in which a majority of this Court was finally induced to expand the meaning *620 of “due process” so as to give courts power to block efforts of the state and national governments to regulate economic affairs.  The present case does not afford a proper occasion to discuss the soundness of that doctrine because, as stated in Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s dissent, “that issue is not here in controversy.” The salutary practice whereby courts do not discuss issues in the abstract applies with peculiar force to Constitutional questions.  Since, however, the dissent adverts to a highly controversial due process doctrine and implies its acceptance by Congress, we feel compelled to say that we do not understand that Congress voluntarily has acquiesced in a Constitutional principle of government that courts, rather than legislative bodies, possess final authority over regulation of economic affairs.  Even this Court has not always fully embraced that principle, and we wish to repeat that we have never acquiesced in it, and do not now.  See Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., <citedDecision>315 U. S. 575, 599-601</citedDecision> .  Hope produces about one-third of its annual gas requirements and purchases the rest under some 300 contracts.  These five companies are the East Ohio Gas Co., the Peoples Natural Gas Co., the River Gas Co., the Fayette County Gas Co., and the Manufacturers Light & Heat Co. The first three of these companies are, like Hope, subsidiaries of Standard Oil Co. (N. J.).  East Ohio and River distribute gas in Ohio, the other three in Pennsylvania.  Hope’s approximate sales in m. c. f. for 1940 may be classified as follows: Local West Virginia sales.  11,000,000 East Ohio.  40,000,000 Peoples.
