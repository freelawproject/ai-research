 Scholarship cannot flourish in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust.  Teachers and students must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding; otherwise ouf civilization will stagnate and die.” We emphasize once again that “[precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms,” N. A. A. C. P. v. Button, *604 371 U. S. 415, 438 ; “[f]or standards of permissible statutory vagueness are strict in the area of free expression.... Because First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity.” Id., at 432-433 .  New York’s complicated and intricate scheme plainly violates that standard.  When one must guess what conduct or utterance may lose him his position, one necessarily will “steer far wider of the unlawful zone .  .  .  .” Speiser v. Randall, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 513, 526</citedDecision> .  For “¿tjhe threat of sanctions may deter .  .  .  almost as potently as the actual application of sanctions.” N. A. A. C. P. v. Button, supra, at 433 .  The danger of that chilling effect upon the exercise of vital First Amendment rights must be guarded against by sensitive tools which clearly inform teachers what is being proscribed.  See Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359, 369 ; Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, 368 U. S. 278 ; Baggett v. Bullitt, supra. The regulatory maze created by New York is wholly lacking in “terms susceptible of objective measurement.” Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, supra, at 286.

 That premise was that public employment, including academic employment, may be conditioned upon the surrender of constitutional rights which could not be abridged by direct government action.  Teachers, the Court said in Adler , “may work for the school system upon the reasonable terms laid down by the proper authorities of New York. If they do not choose to work on such terms, they are at liberty to retain their beliefs and associations and go elsewhere.” 342 U. S., at 492 .  The Court also stated that a teacher denied employment because of membership in a listed organization “is not thereby denied the right of free speech and assembly.  Hir freedom of choice between membership in the organization and employment in the school system might be limited, but not his freedom of speech or assembly, except in the remote sense that limitation is inherent in every choice.” Id., at 493 .  However, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit correctly said in an earlier stage of this case, “... the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless *606 'of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.” Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 345 F. 2d 236, 239 .  Indeed, that theory was expressly rejected in a series of decisions following Adler .  See Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 ; Slochower v. Board of Education, 350 U. S. 551 ; Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, supra; Baggett v. Bullitt, supra; Shelton v. Tucker, supra; Speiser v. <citedDecision>Randall, supra;</citedDecision> see also Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232 ; Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 .  In Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 404 , we said: “It is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of.  or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege.” We proceed then to the question of the validity of the provisions of subdivision 1 (c) of § 105 and subdivision 2 of § 3022, barring employment to members of listed organizations.  Here again constitutional doctrine has developed since Adler .  Mere knowing membership without a specific intent to further the unlawful aims of an organization is not a constitutionally adequate basis for exclusion from such positions as those held by appellants.  In Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11 , we said, “Those who join an organization but do not share its unlawful purposes and who do not participate in its unlawful activities surely pose no threat, either as citizens or as public employees.” Id., at 17 .  We there struck down a statutorily required oath binding the state employee not to become a member of the Communist Party with knowledge of its unlawful purpose, on threat of discharge and perjury prosecution if the oath were violated.

 Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 195 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  Whether or not loss of public employment constitutes “punishment,” cf. U nited States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303 , there can be no doubt that the repressive impact of the threat of discharge will be no less direct or substantial.  See Lazarsfeld & Thielens, The Academic Mind 92-112, 192-217; Biddle, The Fear of Freedom 155 et seq.; Jahoda & Cook, *608 Security Measures and Freedom of Thought: An Exploratory Study of the Impact of Loyalty and Security Programs, 61 Yale L. J. 295 (1952).  See generally, Maclver, Academic Freedom in Our Time; Hullfish, Educational Freedom in an Age of Anxiety; Konvitz, Expanding Liberties 86-108; Morris, Academic Freedom and Loyalty Oaths, 28 Law & Contemp.  Prob. 487 (1963).  In light of our disposition, we need not consider appellants’ contention that the burden placed on the employee of coming forward with substantial rebutting evidence upon proof of membership in a listed organization is constitutionally impermissible.  Compare Speiser v. Randall, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 513</citedDecision> .  Now section 105.  Now section 105.
