<p id="b307-5">The Court today overturns a rule of evidence always the law and formally announced in 1914 by a unanimous Court including Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Hughes. <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U. S. 383, 398. The rule has since that time been applied in this Court’s unanimous <em>per curiam </em>decision in 1925 in <em>Center </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U. S. 575, and for nearly half a century, as a matter of course, in federal prosecutions without number throughout the United States. In 1927, a unanimous Court, on which sat Mr. Justice Holmes, Mr. Justice Brandéis and Mr. Justice Stone, thus acknowledged the rule: “[w]e do not question the right of the federal government to avail itself of evidence improperly seized by state officers operating entirely upon their own account.” <em>Byars </em>v. <em>United States, </em>273 U. S. 28, 33. It can hardly be denied that Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brandéis were the originators and formulators of the body of our present constitutional law pertaining to civil liberties; pronouncements since have merely been echoes and applications, when not distortions, of principles laid down by them.</p>
<p id="b307-6">Of course our law, and particularly our procedural law, does not stick fast in the past. (Speaking wholly for myself, there is indeed an appropriate basis derived from the nature of our federalism — which I shall later set forth — for modification in the circumstances of the present cases of the rule admitting state-seized evidence, regardless of the way in which it was seized.) But when a rule of law has the history and the intrinsic authority of the rule overturned today, when it has been for so long a part <page-number citation-index="1" label="234">*234</page-number>of the administration of justice in the federal courts, a change, when not constitutionally compelled as the present change concededly is not, must justify itself either by the demands of new experience undermining the justification of the established rule or by new insight into the undesirable consequences of the old rule. The rule the Court newly promulgates today draws upon neither of these justifications and is not supported by any of this Court’s previous decisions, while raising serious difficulties in its application, including undue conflict with state law and with state courts.</p>
<p id="b308-4">We are concerned with a rule governing the admissibility of relevant evidence in federal courts. The pertinent general principle, responding to the deepest needs of society, is that society is entitled to every man’s evidence. As the underlying aim of judicial inquiry is ascertainable truth, everything rationally related to ascertaining the truth is presumptively admissible. Limitations are properly placed upon the operation of this general principle only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth. The basic consideration in these cases is whether there are present any overriding reasons for not accepting evidence concededly relevant to a federal judicial inquiry regarding a violation of federal law.</p>
<p id="b308-5">Overriding public considerations are reflected in the exclusion from evidence of the narrow classes of privileged communications, in the exclusion designed to prevent people from being compelled to convict themselves out of their own mouths developed under the shelter of the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against self-incrimination, and insofar as the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment puts curbs on the evidentiary law of the States. Respect is also due a further consideration <page-number citation-index="1" label="235">*235</page-number>that courts of law are, after all, in the service of justice and that the enforcement of basic moralities by courts should at times be deemed more important than the full utilization of all relevant evidence in a particular case. See <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U. S. 385. Regard for this consideration led Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brandéis to urge that the federal courts should not permit the Department of Justice to become the willing beneficiary of stolen goods through their use in evidence in a federal prosecution: “Respect for law will not be advanced by resort, in its enforcement, to means which shock the common man’s sense of decency and fair play.” It is noteworthy that while this view was expressed by Holmes and Brandéis, JJ. in 1921 in dissent in <em>Burdeau </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>256 U. S. 465, 477, it did not lead them in 1927, in <em>Byars </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>to question the right of the Federal Government to utilize the very kind of evidence involved in these two cases.</p>
<p id="b309-5">Closer to our immediate problem are the evidentiary problems arising out of the interdiction of the Fourth Amendment against “unreasonable searches and seizures.” This constitutional provision addresses itself to matters that vitally relate to individual freedom. On this account another exclusion of relevant evidence has been developed in the federal courts in response to what was deemed to be a compelling public need implicit in that Amendment. Because of what was deemed to be a vital relation to the vindication of the Amendment so that its important protection would otherwise be of “no value,” this Court in <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U. S. 383, held it appropriate to exclude from federal courts evidence seized by federal officials in disregard of the Fourth Amendment. It was thought more important to exert general legal pressures to secure obedience to the Fourth Amendment on the part of federal law-enforcing officers than to enforce the general principle of relevance in particular cases. This <page-number citation-index="1" label="236">*236</page-number>exclusionary rule of <em>Weeks </em>has also been applied to violations of federal law by federal officers, closely relating to the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment, although not of the full seriousness of constitutional violations. See, <em>e. g., Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U. S. 301.</p>
<p id="b310-4">The Fourth Amendment, as applied in <em>Weeks </em>and cases since, operates, as do all the provisions of the Federal Bill of Rights, within the limitations imposed by our federal system. It has been held without deviation that the specific provisions of the first eight Amendments are not limitations upon the power of the States or available safeguards of the individual against state authority. Of course the same is true of procedural protections afforded by federal statutes not resting on the Constitution. It has followed from this that, until today, in applying the <em>Weeks </em>rule of exclusion a vital question has always been whether the offending search or seizure was conducted in any part by federal officials or in the interest of the Federal Government, or whether it was conducted solely by state officers acting exclusively for state purposes. Only if the Federal Government “had a hand” in the search could the Fourth Amendment or federal statutory restrictions, and thus the <em>Weeks </em>exclusionary rule, apply. See <em>Byars </em>v. <em>United States, </em>273 U. S. 28; <em>Lustig </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U. S. 74, 78. The <em>Weeks </em>case itself, as has been said, held that state misconduct was not to be the basis for application of the federal exclusionary rule. 232 U. S., at 398. Until today that has been the law of the land.</p>
<p id="b310-5">Have there been developments since <em>Weeks, </em>either intellectual or practical, which should lead the Court to overturn the authoritative rule of that case and for the first time bar relevant evidence innocently secured by federal authorities, in cases involving no federal misconduct whatever, where there has been neither violation of <page-number citation-index="1" label="237">*237</page-number>the Fourth Amendment nor violation of a federal statute by federal officers or any agent for them?</p>
<p id="b311-5">The Court finds such a significant development, destroying in its view the “foundations,” the “doctrinal underpinning” of the express and authoritative limitation of the <em>Weeks </em>exclusionary rule to cases of federal violations, in what was said in 1949 in <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>338 U. S. 25, 27-28, recognizing that “[t]he security of one’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police — which is at the core of the Fourth Amendment — is basic to a free society. It is therefore implicit in ‘the concept of ordered liberty’ and as such enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause.” The Court asserts that there is no longer any logic in restricting the application of the <em>Weeks </em>exclusionary rule to the fruits of federal seizures, for <em>Wolf </em>recognizes that state seizures may also encroach on interests protected by the Federal Constitution. The rule which the Court announces on the basis of this analysis is that there is to be excluded from federal prosecutions all evidence seized by state officers “during a search which, if conducted by federal officers, would have violated the defendant’s immunity from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment.” As the Court’s rule only purports to exclude evidence seized by state officers in violation of the Constitution, it is plain that the Court assumes for the purposes of these cases that, as a consequence of <em>Wolf, </em>precisely the same rules are applicable in determining whether the conduct of state officials violates the Constitution as are applicable in determining whether the conduct of federal officials does so, and precisely the same exclusionary remedy is deemed appropriate for one behavior as for the other.</p>
<p id="b311-6">In this use of <em>Wolf </em>the Court disregards not only what precisely was said there, namely, that only what was <page-number citation-index="1" label="238">*238</page-number>characterized as the “core of the Fourth Amendment,” not the Amendment itself, is enforceable against the States, but also the fact that what was said in <em>Wolf </em>was said with reference to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and not with reference to the specific guarantees of the Fourth Amendment. The scope and effect of these two constitutional provisions cannot be equated, as the Court would have it. These are constitutional provisions wholly different in history, scope and incidence, and that is crucial to our problem. It is of course true, as expressed in <em>Wolf, </em>that some of the principles underlying the specific safeguards of the first eight Amendments are implied limitations upon the States drawn out of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and to that extent, but no more, afford federal protection to individuals against state power. But it is basic to the structure and functioning of our federal system to distinguish between the specifics of the Bill of Rights of the first eight Amendments and the generalities of the Due Process Clause translated into concreteness case by case ever since <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>New </em>Orleans, 96 U. S. 97, by a process of inclusion and exclusion, as analyzed with great particularity by Mr. Justice Cardozo in <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U. S. 319.</p>
<p id="b312-4">This vital distinction, running through hundreds of cases, underlies the decision in <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado. </em>It is therefore a complete misconception of the <em>Wolf </em>case to assume, as the Court does as the basis for its innovating rule, that every finding by this Court of a technical lack of a search warrant, thereby making a search unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, constitutes an “arbitrary intrusion” of privacy so as to make the same conduct on the part of state officials a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The divisions in this Court over the years regarding what is and what is not to be deemed an unreasonable search within the meaning of the Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index="1" label="239">*239</page-number>ment and the shifting views of members of the Court in this regard, prove that in evolving the meaning of the Fourth Amendment the decisions of this Court have frequently turned on dialectical niceties and have not reflected those fundamental considerations of civilized conduct on which applications of the Due Process Clause turn. See, for example, the varying views of the Court as a whole, and of individual members, regarding the “reasonableness” under the Fourth Amendment of searches without warrants incident to arrests, as illustrated by comparing <em>Marron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>275 U. S. 192, with <em>Go-Bart Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>282 U. S. 344, and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lefkowitz, </em>285 U. S. 452; <em>Go-Bart, supra, </em>and <em>Lefkowitz, supra, </em>with <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>331 U. S. 145, and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56; also <em>Harris, supra, </em>with <em>Trupiano </em>v. <em>United States, </em>334 U. S. 699, and <em>Trupiano </em>with <em>Rabinowitz, supra </em>(overruling Trupiano). See also the Court’s differing conceptions regarding the evidence necessary to constitute “probable cause” upon which to base a warrant or a search without a warrant, as revealed by comparing <em>Grau </em>v. <em>United States, </em>287 U. S. 124, 128, with <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U. S. 307, 312, n. 4 (rejecting <em>Grau), </em>and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 270.</p>
<p id="b313-5">What the Court now decides is that these variegated judgments, these fluctuating and uncertain views of what constitutes an “unreasonable search” under the Fourth Amendment in conduct by federal officials, are to determine whether what is done by state police, wholly beyond federal supervision, violates the Due Process Clause. The observation in <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>reflecting as it did the fundamental protection of the Due Process Clause against “arbitrary” police conduct, and not the specific, restrictive protection of the Fourth Amendment, hardly supports that proposition or the new rule which the Court rests upon it. The identity of the protection <page-number citation-index="1" label="240">*240</page-number>of the Due Process Clause against arbitrary searches with the scope of the protection of the Fourth Amendment is something the Court assumes for the first time today. It assumes this without explication in reason or in reliance upon authority, and entirely without regard for the essential difference, which has always been recognized by this Court, between the particularities of the first eight Amendments and the fundamental nature of what constitutes due process.</p>
<p id="b314-4">Nor can I understand how <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado </em>furnishes the slightest support for the application of the <em>Weeks </em>exclusionary rule, designed as that was to enforce the Fourth Amendment and -indirectly to discipline federal officers under this Court’s peculiarly comprehensive supervisory power over them, to the present cases, where the infractions, if any, were by state officers and were of rights arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court finds what it calls the “ultimate holding” in <em>Wolf, </em>namely, that the exclusionary rule is not to be fastened upon state courts in enforcement of rights arising under the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment against arbitrary searches and seizures, something with which “we are not here directly concerned.” I fail to understand why this holding is not of essential relevance to the holding of these cases. In the first place <em>Wolf </em>wholly rebuts the Court’s assertion that there is no logic in distinguishing how the Fourteenth Amendment is to be enforced against state officials from how the Fourth is to be enforced against federal officers. The point of <em>Wolf </em>was that the logic of this was imperative and that the remedies under the two Amendments are not the same. In the second place, in light of the holding of <em>Wolf </em>that state courts may admit evidence like that involved in these cases, it cannot be said that there is any sufficient justification based upon controlling the conduct of state officers for excluding such evidence from federal <page-number citation-index="1" label="241">*241</page-number>courts, as the Court would do, when gathered by state officials whose States would admit it. The underlying assumption on which the exclusionary rule of <em>Weeks </em>rests is that barring evidence illegally secured will have an inhibiting, one hopes a civilizing, influence upon law officers. With due respect, it is fanciful to assume that law-enforcing authorities of States which do not have an exclusionary rule will to any significant degree be influenced by the potential exclusion in federal prosecutions of evidence secured by them when state prosecutions, which surely are their preoccupation, remain free to use the evidence. At any rate, what warrant is there for the federal courts to assume the same supervisory control over state officials as they have assumed over federal officers, even if that control could be effective? And the exertion of controlling pressures upon the police is admittedly the only justification for any exclusionary rule.</p>
<p id="b315-5">Thus, I do not understand how <em>Wolf </em>v. Colorado, which is the only case relied upon by the Court as authority for its innovation, furnishes support for the Court’s new rule of evidence. It seems to me to do the opposite. Nor can the Court’s new rule be justified as an effective means for controlling state officers. Neither do I think the Court’s adoption of an exclusionary rule in the present cases finds justification, as the Court suggests, in light of any universal recognition of the need of excluding evidence such as is involved in these cases in order to assure the wise and effective administration of criminal justice. It cannot be denied that the appropriateness of barring relevant evidence as a means for regulating police conduct has not been unquestioned even by those most zealous for honest law enforcement, and it certainly has not gone unquestioned as outweighing the interest of society in bringing criminals to justice. See, <em>e. g., People </em>v. <em>Defore, </em>242 N. Y. 13, 21, 150 N. E. 585, 587-588; 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), § 2184. And I regret to say that I do not <page-number citation-index="1" label="242">*242</page-number>find evidence that the movement towards adoption of the rule of exclusion has been, as we are told, “seemingly inexorable.” On the contrary, what impresses me is the obduracy of high-minded state courts, like that of New York under the leadership of Judge Cardozo, in refusing to adopt the federal rule of exclusion. Indeed, this impressive insistence of States not to follow the <em>Weeks </em>exclusionary rule was the controlling consideration of the decision in <em>Wolf </em>not to read it into the requirement of “due process” under the Fourteenth Amendment. As the material the Court has collected shows, fully half the States have refused to adhere to our <em>Weeks </em>rule, nearly fifty years after this Court has deemed it appropriate for the federal administration of criminal justice.</p>
<p id="b316-4">Apart from any affirmative justifications for the new rule, it is suggested in support of the need for making the Court’s innovation that the distinction made since <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United, States </em>for purposes of excluding evidence, turning on whether or not federal officials had any share in the search, has engendered practical difficulties and for that reason ought now to be discarded. It is also suggested that the rule which has prevailed under <em>Weeks </em>and <em>Byars </em>to this day “implicitly invites federal officers to withdraw from such association [with state law-enforcement officers] and at least tacitly to encourage state officers in the disregard of constitutionally protected freedom.” I am not aware of evidence to sustain the view that the distinction between federal and state searches has been particularly difficult of application. Individual cases have merely presented the everyday issue of evaluating testimony and testimony touching an issue relatively easy of ascertainment. I know of no opinion in any federal court, and the Court points to none, which has revealed any consciousness of having been confronted with too exacting a task for adjudication when called upon to decide whether a search was or was not to be deemed a federal search. <page-number citation-index="1" label="243">*243</page-number>This Court’s decisions certainly do not reflect an awareness of such difficulties. And if the rulé, as appears from the decisions of the judges who have had to apply it, has evidently been in general a workable one, it surely should not be discarded because of unsupported assumptions that federal officials are prone to evade it and to cooperate secretly with state police in improper activities. Disregard of the history, authority and experience that support the rule now cast into limbo ought to have a more substantiated justification than the fragile assumption that federal officers look for opportunities to engage in, to use the Court’s language, “subterfuge” and “evasion” of a command sanctioned by this Court. I would not so belittle this Court’s authority. I had supposed we should attribute to the law-enforcing authorities of the Government respect for this Court’s weighty course of decisions and not a flouting of them.</p>
<p id="b317-5">Whatever difficulties of application there may be in the present rule — and the opinions of those who have had to apply it do not indicate that they are significant— they surely cannot lead us to exchange a tried and settled principle for the Court’s new doctrine. For that doctrine, although the Court purports to be guided by the practical consequences of rules of evidence in this area and by considerations of comity between federal and state courts and policies, not only raises new and far greater difficulties than did the old rule, but is also pregnant with new disharmonies between federal and state authorities and between federal and state courts.</p>
<p id="b317-6"><em>First. </em>The Court’s new rule introduces into the law governing the admissibility of search-and-seizure evidence in federal prosecutions a troublesome and uncertain new criterion, namely, the “unconstitutionality” of police conduct, as distinguished from its mere illegality under state or federal law. Under the rule the Court today announces, the federal trial court, whenever state-seized evidence is <page-number citation-index="1" label="244">*244</page-number>challenged, must decide the wholly hypothetical question whether that evidence was “obtained by state officers during a search which, if conducted by federal officers, would have violated the defendant’s immunity from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment.” Irrelevant are violations of state law, or hypothetical violations of federal statutes, had the search been “conducted by federal officers.”</p>
<p id="b318-4">The <em>Weeks </em>rule of exclusion, as enforced by this Court, applies to all illegal seizures on the part of federal officers. If the officer’s conduct is by statute or court-developed rule illegal, the evidence is excluded, and it is not necessary to say whether or not the rule of conduct flows directly from the Constitution. This has been an efficient, workable evidentiary criterion unencumbered with weighty constitutional distinctions. See, for example, <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U. S. 301, where evidence was excluded without a mention of the Constitution. This Court or the lower federal courts have thus never, until today, needed to develop criteria distinguishing those federal regulations of the conduct of federal officers which are compelled by the Constitution from those which are entrusted to the discretion of Congress or the courts to develop. We must do so now, and so must federal trial courts concern themselves with such constitutional determinations in the midst of adjudicating motions to suppress state evidence. This is bound to be a troublesome process in light of the complete absence of such criteria. For example, are the special federal provisions regarding night search warrants of a constitutional nature? And what of the rules governing the execution of lawful warrants, applied in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, supra? </em>We have never needed to pronounce upon these totally abstract and doctrinaire questions, and there surely is no need to announce a rule which forces us to do so now, when such a rule is not constitutionally required, but is concededly imposed as <page-number citation-index="1" label="245">*245</page-number>a matter of this Court’s discretionary power to formulate rules of evidence for federal litigation. After all, it makes not the slightest difference from the point of view of the admissibility of evidence whether what a federal officer does is simply illegal or illegal because unconstitutional. Why introduce such subtleties, in a hypothetical federal context, when passing on state evidence?</p>
<p id="b319-5"><em>Second. </em>The Court’s new rule potentially frustrates and creates undesirable conflict with valid and praiseworthy state policies which attempt to protect individuals from unlawful police conduct. Although the Court purports to be responsive to the needs of proper law enforcement .and to considerations of comity between state and federal law, when it comes to elaborate its new rule it does so as follows: “[t]he test is one of federal [constitutional] law, neither enlarged by what one state court may have countenanced, nor diminished by what another may have colorably suppressed.” So comity plays no part at all, and the fruits of illegal law enforcement may well be admitted in federal courts directly contrary to state law. State law seeking to control improper methods of law enforcement is frustrated by the Court’s new rule when- ■ ever a State which enforces an exclusionary rule places restrictions upon the conduct of its officers not directly required by the Fourth Amendment with regard to federal officers. The Court’s new rule will, for example, admit evidence illegally seized under a state law which is identical to a federal statute restricting federal officers, so long as the federal statute goes beyond the minimum requirements of the Constitution. One would suppose that such a situation would be one in which this Court would plainly respect the state policy as constituting nothing but a local duplication of a federal policy. Yet the rule promulgated today flouts such a state regulation. A state officer who disobeys it needs only to turn his evidence over, to the federal prosecutor, who may freely utilize it under today’s <page-number citation-index="1" label="246">*246</page-number>innovation in disregard of the disciplinary policy of the State’s exclusionary rule. I cannot think why the federal courts should thus encourage state illegalities.</p>
<p id="b320-4">I do not merely indulge in assumptions regarding the serious frustrations of valid state regulations of state law-enforcement officers which may arise from the rule formulated today. Take a concrete example of this mischief. In <em>Breithaupt </em>v. <em>Abram, </em>352 U. S. 432, this Court decided that it did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment for a State to take blood from a defendant without his consent and use it in evidence against him, for such police methods were found not to be “offensive” or “unreasonable.” Nevertheless, States may decide, and have decided, that taking blood without consent is by state standards reprehensible, and that to discourage such conduct by its police blood-test evidence must be suppressed in use in state prosecutions. See <em>Lebel </em>v. <em>Swincicki, </em>354 Mich. 427, 93 N. W. 2d 281; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kroening, </em>274 Wis. 266, 271-276, 79 N. W. 2d 810, 814-817. Such a state policy is surely entitled to our respect if we are to exclude evidence on the basis of the illegal activity of state officers. Yet because of the decision in <em>Breithaupt, </em>the Court’s new rule permits the admission of blood-test evidence in a federal prosecution, ignoring the State’s decision that the police conduct producing it is illegal and that it therefore ought to be suppressed. And the same is to be true of evidence seized by state police in violation of a state rule regarding searches incident to lawful arrests which is more restrictive upon the police than the present version of the fluctuating federal rule, or of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant or to an arrest without a warrant which did not meet state standards of “probable cause” more restrictive than the federal standards as lately developed. State rules in these areas may be and in some States are more <page-number citation-index="1" label="247">*247</page-number>restrictive than federal rules. See, for example, restricting the right of incidental search more than has this Court, <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>103 W. Va. 77, 136 S. E. 703; <em>State </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>145 Wash. 87, 258 P. 1030; <em>Flannery </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>324 S. W. 2d 128 (Ky.); <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>State, </em>320 P. 2d 412 (Okla.); and imposing more exacting standards of “probable cause” than federal law imposes, <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>State, </em>320 P. 2d 412 (Okla.) (expressly refusing to follow <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U. S. 160); <em>Averill </em>v. <em>State, </em>52 So. 2d 791 (Fla.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Thymiakas, </em>140 Cal. App. 2d 940, 296 P. 2d 4. Especially pertinent in this regard is the following statement in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cohan, </em>44 Cal. 2d 434, 450-451, 282 P. 2d 905, 915, adopting an exclusionary rule for California: “In developing a rule of evidence applicable in the state courts, this court is not bound by the decisions that have applied the federal rule, and if it appears that those decisions have developed needless refinements and distinctions, this court need not follow them. Similarly, if the federal cases indicate needless limitations on the right to conduct reasonable searches and seizures or to secure warrants, this court is free to reject them.”</p>
<p id="b321-5">In fact, in the very two cases now before the Court state courts have found their officers’ conduct illegal and have ordered suppression of the evidence thereby gained. Yet the Court refuses to respect these findings and sends the cases back to the District Courts for independent rulings regarding the federal constitutional validity of the state officers’ conduct. If these state infractions are not found to be of constitutional dimensions, and it is surely doubtful whether they were of that degree of seriousness under some of our decisions, the evidence will be admitted though wrongfully seized under the governing state law. The rule promulgated today would thus undo a State’s disciplinary policy against police misconduct, <page-number citation-index="1" label="248">*248</page-number>while in the contrary situation, where the State would admit evidence now rejected by the Court, police conduct sustained by state law would not be affected.</p>
<p id="b322-4"><em>Third. </em>The Court’s new rule creates potential conflict between • federal and state courts even when the legal standards of police conduct upon which exclusion is to turn are the same in both courts. The Court says that “[i]n determining whether there has been an unreasonable search and seizure by state officers, a federal court must make an independent inquiry, whether or not there has been such an inquiry by a state court, and irrespective of how any such inquiry may have turned out.” Again considerations of comity are ignored. Applying the same legal standards, a federal tribunal may hold state officers blameless after a state court has condemned their conduct, or it may hold them to have been at fault after the State has absolved them. I cannot imagine the justification for permitting a federal court to make such conflicting pronouncements, debilitating local authority in matters over which the local courts should and do have primary responsibility.</p>
<p id="b322-5">In summary, then, although the Court professes to be responsive to “[t]he very essence of a healthy federalism” and “the avoidance of needless conflict between state and federal courts,” the rule it actually formulates is wholly unresponsive to valid state policies while carrying a great risk of needless conflict between state and federal policies and between state and federal courts. With regard to evidence from States which have not adopted exclusionary rules, the Court’s innovation of today deprives the federal courts of relevant evidence through hazardous constitutional determinations without any significant or legitimate compensating effect upon state or federal law enforcement. In States which do apply an exclusionary rule, the Court’s new formulation accords no respect to valid state policies and is a source of conflict with state <page-number citation-index="1" label="249">*249</page-number>courts. The Court promulgates a rule whose only practical justification is the regulation of state officials without the slightest regard for achieving harmony with valid state laws which necessarily must be the primary concern of those officials. And although the Court recognizes considerations of “judicial integrity” in accepting illegally seized evidence, it refuses to respect state determinations that certain evidence has in fact been illegally gathered under the applicable law.</p>
<p id="b323-5">I would agree wholly with my Brothers Clark, Harlan and Whittaker, who join me in the reasons for dissenting from the Court’s decision, that the judgments should be affirmed if, like them, I found the only choice to be one between the <em>Weeks-Byars </em>doctrine and today’s decision. For me, however, the course of events since the promulgation of the <em>Weeks </em>doctrine suggests a modification of it consonant with the thinking of <em>Weeks </em>and therefore not essentially departing from it. I would modify the <em>Weeks-Byars </em>rule to give due heed to appropriate comity between federal and state court determinations and due respect for the discretion left to the States by <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado </em>to develop and apply exclusionary rules upon their own initiative and I therefore would exclude the evidence in these cases on the basis of state decisions to suppress it. Specifically, I would recognize that about half the States have now adopted exclusionary rules although only one State had such a rule when the <em>Weeks </em>case was decided. It respects what was decided in <em>Weeks </em>regarding state-seized evidence for the federal courts now to adjust their rules of evidence to support the States which have adopted the <em>Weeks </em>exclusionary rule for themselves, thereby exercising the same control over state officials as <em>Weeks </em>found it appropriate for the federal courts to exercise over federal officials. Thus, although I find no good reason not to admit in federal courts evidence gathered by state officials in States which would admit the evidence, I would <page-number citation-index="1" label="250">*250</page-number>not admit such evidence in cases like the present, where state courts, enforcing their exclusionary rules, have found their officers guilty of infractions of the rules properly regulating their conduct and have suppressed the evidence. Just as Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brandéis in <em>Burdeau </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>256 U. S. 465, 476-477 (dissenting), deemed it not seemly for a federal court to allow the Department of Justice to be the knowing beneficiary of stolen goods, so it seems to me unseemly for a federal court not to respect the determination of a state court that its own officials were guilty of wrongdoing and not to support the State’s policy to prevent those officials from making use through federal prosecution of the fruits of their wrongdoing. Dealing with the generality of cases, as rules of evidence should, to let a state determination regarding the legality of the conduct of state officials determine the admissibility in a federal court of evidence gathered by them would not only avoid a retrial of identical issues in the federal court, but would also avoid the unseemliness and disruption of state authority involved in having a federal court decide that a search was legal, as it might well do when the federal constitutional standards are narrower than state standards, after a state court has adjudged the search illegal.</p>
<p id="b324-4">I am not unmindful that this has its own difficulties, as for instance, the fact that state motions to suppress are normally determined only by a trial judge and are generally not reviewable at all if granted and followed by acquittal. And so a state court decision may not inevitably reflect the State's judicial policy as formulated by its highest court. Difficulties would also be present when there has been no state decision regarding the legality of the seizure, and when it is not clear to the federal court which must decide upon admissibility what the state decision would be. Occasionally, a state decision might <page-number citation-index="1" label="251">*251</page-number>unjustifiably frustrate an important federal prosecution dependent upon state-seized evidence. These are difficulties inherent in evolving harmonious relations in the interconnected interests between the States and the Nation in our federal system. The consequences of these difficulties seem to me far less weighty and much less dubious than those of the upsetting decision of today. They seem to me outweighed by the support which should be afforded to valid state law enforcement.</p>
<p id="b325-5">If the modified rule I have outlined is not to be adopted, however, the difficulties in the Court’s decision make it far more preferable in my view to continue adherence to the sharp line drawn by <em>Weeks </em>and <em>Byars </em>between state- and federally-seized evidence. I would not embark upon a hazardous jettisoning of a rule which has prevailed in the federal courts for half a century without bringing to the surface demonstrated evils, indeed without its having evoked serious criticism of weight, barring recent discussion largely of an abstract and doctrinaire nature.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>

<p id="b325-7">I subscribe to all that my Brother Frankfurter has written in criticism of the Court’s newly fashioned exclusionary rule. But, with deference, I must also say that, in my view, the arguments which he has so convincingly set forth likewise serve to block the more limited inroads <page-number citation-index="1" label="252">*252</page-number>which he would make on the so-called “silver platter” doctrine. <em>Lustig </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U. S. 74, 79. I would retain intact the nonexclusionary rule of the <em>Weeks </em>and <em>Byars </em>cases, which has behind it the strongest judicial credentials, the sanction of long usage, and the support of what, in my opinion, is sound constitutional doctrine under our federal scheme of things, doctrine which only as recently as last Term was reiterated by this Court. See <em>Abbate </em>v. <em>United States, </em>359 U. S. 187; <em>Bartkus </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>359 U. S. 121. Except for this reservation, I join the dissenting opinion of my Brother Frankfurter.</p>
<p id="b326-4">I would affirm the judgments in both of the cases before us.</p>

<p id="b325-8">See the authorities cited in the Court’s note 2, and see <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>United States, </em>104 U. S. App. D. C. 205, 260 F. 2d 723, the only Court of Appeals decision to concur with the views the Court today expresses. What criticisms there have been of the <em>Weeks </em>rule have largely been stimulated by <em>Wolf </em>and have in essence been reflections of dissatisfaction with the substantive decision in that case, and thus do not constitute supports for the doctrine now evolved by the Court.</p>
