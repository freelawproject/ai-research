 Rather, the United States urged that the search of movable luggage could be considered analogous to the search of an automobile.  433 U. S., at 11-12 .  The Court rejected this argument because, it reasoned, a person expects more privacy in his luggage and personal effects than he does in his automobile.  Id., at 13 .  Moreover, it concluded that as “may often not be the case when automobiles are seized,” secure storage facilities are usually available when the police seize luggage.  Id., at 13, n. 7 .  In Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1979), the Court extended Chadwick’s, rule to apply to a suitcase actually being transported in the trunk of a car. In <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , the police had probable cause to believe a suitcase contained marijuana.  They watched as the defendant placed the suitcase in the trunk of a taxi and was driven away.  The police pursued the taxi for several blocks, stopped it, found the suitcase in the trunk, and searched it.  Although the Court had applied the Carroll doctrine to searches of integral parts of the automobile itself, (indeed, in Carroll , contraband whiskey was in the upholstery of the seats, see 267 U. S., at 136 ), it did not extend the doctrine to the warrantless search of personal lug *572 gage “merely because it was located in an automobile lawfully stopped by the police.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 765</citedDecision> .  Again, the <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> majority stressed the heightened privacy expectation in personal luggage and concluded that the presence of luggage in an automobile did not diminish the owner’s expectation of privacy in his personal items.  <citedDecision>Id., at 764-765</citedDecision> .  Cf. California v. Carney, 471 U. S. 386 (1985).  In Ross , the Court endeavored to distinguish between Carroll , which governed the Ross automobile search, and Chad-tuick, which governed the <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> automobile search.  It held that the Carroll doctrine covered searches of automobiles when the police had probable cause to search an entire vehicle, but that the Chadwick doctrine governed searches of luggage when the officers had probable cause to search only a container within the vehicle.  Thus, in a Ross situation, the police could conduct a reasonable search under the Fourth Amendment without obtaining a warrant, whereas in a <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> situation, the police had to obtain a warrant before they searched.  Justice Stevens is correct, of course, that Ross involved the scope of an automobile search.  See post, at 592.  Ross held that closed containers encountered by the police during a warrantless search of a car pursuant to the automobile exception could also be searched.  Thus, this Court in Ross took the critical step of saying that closed containers in cars could be searched without a warrant because of their presence within the automobile.  Despite the protection that <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> purported to extend to closed containers, the privacy interest in those closed containers yielded to the broad scope of an automobile search.  h-i 1 — 1 I — l The facts m this case closely resemble the facts m Ross .  In Ross , the police had probable cause to believe that drugs were stored in the trunk of a particular car. See 456 U. S., at 800 .  Here, the California Court of Appeal concluded that the police had probable cause to believe that respondent was *573 carrying marijuana in a bag in his car’s trunk.  2 216 Cal. App. 3d, at 590 , 265 Cal. Rptr., at 25 .  Furthermore, for what it is worth, in Ross , as here, the drugs in the trunk were contained in a brown paper bag.  This Court in Ross rejected Chadwick’s distinction between containers and cars.  It concluded that the expectation of privacy in one’s vehicle is equal to one’s expectation of privacy in the container, and noted that “the privacy interests in a car’s trunk or glove compartment may be no less than those in a movable container.” 456 U. S., at 823 .  It also recognized that it was arguable that the same exigent circumstances that permit a warrantless search of an automobile would justify the warrantless search of a movable container.  Id., at 809 .  In deference to the rule of Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , however, the Court put that question to one side.  <citedDecision>Id., at 809-810</citedDecision> .  It concluded that the time and expense of the warrant process would be misdirected if the police could search every cubic inch of an automobile until they discovered a paper sack, at which point the Fourth Amendment required them to take the sack to a magistrate for permission to look inside.  We now must decide the question deferred in Ross : whether the Fourth Amendment requires the police to obtain a warrant to open the sack in a movable vehicle simply because they lack probable cause to search the entire car. We conclude that it does not.  IV Dissenters in Ross asked why the suitcase in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> was “more private, less difficult for police to seize and store, or in *574 any other relevant respect more properly subject to the warrant requirement, than a container that police discover iñ a probable-cause search of an entire automobile?” <citedDecision>Id., at 839-840</citedDecision> .  We now agree that a container found after a general search of the automobile and a container found in a car after a limited search for the container are equally easy for the police to store and for the suspect to hide or destroy.  In fact, we see no principled distinction in terms of either the privacy expectation or the exigent circumstances between the paper bag found by the police in Ross and the paper bag found by the police here.  Furthermore, by attempting to distinguish between a container for which the police are specifically searching and a container which they come across in a car, we have provided only minimal protection for privacy and have impeded effective law enforcement.  The line between probable cause to search a vehicle and probable cause to search a package in that vehicle is not always clear, and separate rules that govern the two objects to be searched may enable the police to broaden their power to make warrantless searches and disserve privacy interests.  We noted this in Ross in the context of a search of an entire vehicle.  Recognizing that under Carroll , the “entire vehicle itself .
**Lead Opinion**
 The agents took the trucks to headquarters and searched the packages without a warrant.  Id., at 481 .  Relying on Chadwick , the defendants argued that the search was unlawful.  Id., at 482.  The defendants contended that Ross was inapplicable because the agents lacked probable cause to search anything but the packages themselves and supported this contention by noting that a search of the entire vehicle never occurred.  Id., at 483.  We rejected that argument and found Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> inapposite because the agents had probable cause to search the entire body of each truck, although they had chosen not to do so. Id., at 482-483.  We cannot see the benefit of a rule that requires law enforcement officers to conduct a more intrusive search in order to justify a less intrusive one.  To the extent that the Chadwick-Sanders rule protects privacy, its protection is minimal.  Law enforcement officers may seize a container and hold it until they obtain a search warrant.  Chadwick, 433 U. S., at 13 .  “Since the police, by hypothesis, have probable cause to seize the property, we can assume that a warrant will be routinely forthcoming in the overwhelming majority of cases. ” Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 770</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  And the police often will be able to search containers without a warrant, despite the Chadwick-Sanders rule, as a search incident to a lawful arrest.  In New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981), the Court said: *576 “[W]e hold that when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.  “It follows from this conclusion that the police may also examine the contents of any containers found within the passenger compartment.” Id., at 460 (footnote omitted).  Under Belton , the same probable cause to believe that a container holds drugs will allow the police to arrest the person transporting the container and search it.  Finally, the search of a paper bag intrudes far less on individual privacy than does the incursion sanctioned long ago in Carroll .  In that case, prohibition agents slashed the upholstery of the automobile.  This Court nonetheless found their search to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  If destroying the interior of an automobile is not unreasonable, we cannot conclude that looking inside a closed container is.  In light of the minimal protection to privacy afforded by the Chadwick-Sanders rule, and our serious doubt whether that rule substantially serves privacy interests, we now hold that the Fourth Amendment does not compel separate treatment for an automobile search that extends only to a container within the vehicle.  V The Chadwick-Sanders rule not only has failed to protect privacy but also has confused courts and police officers and impeded effective law enforcement.  The conflict between the Carroll doctrine cases and the Chadwick-Sanders line has been criticized in academic commentary.  See, e. g., Gardner, Searches and Seizures of Automobiles and Their Contents: Fourth Amendment Considerations in a Post-Ross World, 62 Neb. L. Rev. 1 (1983); Latzer, Searching Cars and Their Contents: United States v. Ross , 18 Crim. L. Bull. 381 (1982); Kamisar, The “Automobile Search” Cases: The Court Does Little to Clarify the “Labyrinth” of Judicial Uncer *577 tainty, in 3 The Supreme Court: Trends and Developments 1980-1981, p. 69 (D. Opperman ed. 1982).  One leading authority on the Fourth Amendment, after comparing Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> with Carroll and its progeny, observed: “These two lines of authority cannot be completely reconciled, and thus how one comes out in the container-in-the-car situation depends upon which line of authority is used as a point of departure.” 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 63 (2d ed. 1987).  The discrepancy between the two rules has led to confusion for law enforcement officers.  For example, when an officer, who has developed probable cause to believe that a vehicle contains drugs, begins to search the vehicle and immediately discovers a closed container, which rule applies?  The defendant will argue that the fact that the officer first chose to search the container indicates that his probable cause extended only to the container and that Chadtvick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> therefore require a warrant.  On the other hand, the fact that the officer first chose to search in the most obvious location should not restrict the propriety of the search.  The Chadwick rule, as applied in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , has devolved into an anomaly such that the more likely the police are to discover drugs in a container, the less authority they have to search it.  We have noted the virtue of providing “‘“clear and unequivocal” guidelines to the law enforcement profession.’” Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, 151 (1990), quoting Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 676, 682 (1988).  The Chadwick-Sanders rule is the antithesis of a “ ‘clear and unequivocal’ guideline.” Justice Stevens argues that the decisions of this Court evince a lack of confusion about the automobile exception.  See post, at 594.  The first case cited by the dissent, United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983), however, did not involve an automobile at all. We considered in Place the temporary detention of luggage in an airport.  Not only was no automobile involved, but the defendant, Place, was waiting *578 at the airport to board his plane rather than preparing to leave the airport in a car. Any similarity to <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , in which the defendant was leaving the airport in a car, is remote at best.  Place had nothing to do with the automobile exception and is inapposite.  Nor does Justice Stevens’ citation of Oklahoma v. Castleberry, 471 U. S. 146 (1985), support his contention.  Cas-tleberry presented the same question about the application of the automobile exception to the search of a closed container that we face here.  In Castleberry , we affirmed by an equally divided court. That result illustrates this Court’s continued struggle with the scope of the automobile exception rather than the absence of confusion in applying it.  Justice Stevens also argues that law enforcement has not been impeded because the Court has decided 29 Fourth Amendment cases since Ross in favor of the government.  See post, at 600.

 The fact that the state courts and the Federal Courts of Appeals have been reversed in their Fourth Amendment holdings 29 times since 1982 further demonstrates the extent to which our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has confused the courts.  Most important, with the exception of United States v. Johns, 469 U. S. 478 (1985), and Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S. 730 (1983), the Fourth Amendment cases cited by the dissent do not concern automobiles or the automobile exception.  From Carroll through Ross , this Court has explained that automobile searches differ from other searches.  The dissent fails to acknowledge this basic principle and so misconstrues and misapplies our Fourth Amendment case law. The Chadwick dissenters predicted that the container rule would have “the perverse result of allowing fortuitous circumstances to control the outcome” of various searches.  433 *579 U. S., at 22 .  The rule also was so confusing that within two years after Chadwick , this Court found it necessary to expound on the meaning of that decision and explain its application to luggage in general.  Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 761-764</citedDecision> .  Again, dissenters bemoaned the “inherent opaqueness” of the difference between the Carroll and Chadwick principles and noted “the confusion to be created for all concerned.” Id., at 771.  See also Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420, 425-426 (1981) (listing cases decided by Federal Courts of Appeals since Chadwick had been announced).  Three years after <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , we returned in Ross to “this troubled area,” 456 U. S., at 817 , in order to assert that <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> had not cut back on Carroll .  Although we have recognized firmly that the doctrine of stare decisis serves profoundly important purposes in our legal system, this Court has overruled a prior case on the comparatively rare occasion when it has bred confusion or been a derelict or led to anomalous results.  See, e. g., Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 288-289 (1977).  <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> was explicitly undermined in Ross, 456 U. S., at 824 , and the existence of the dual regimes for automobile searches that uncover containers has proved as confusing as the Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> dissenters predicted.  We conclude that it is better to adopt one clear-cut rule to govern automobile searches and eliminate the warrant requirement for closed containers set forth in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> .  VI The interpretation of the Carroll doctrine set forth m Ross now applies to all searches of containers found in an automobile.  In other words, the police may search without a warrant if their search is supported by probable cause.  The Court in Ross put it this way: “The scope of a warrantless search of an automobile .  .  .  is not defined by the nature of the container in which the contraband is secreted.

 ...” Bradley, Two Models of the Fourth Amendment, 83 Mich. L. Rev. 1468 , 1473-1474 (footnotes omitted).  Since then, we have added at least two more.  California v. Carney, 471 *583 U. S. 386 (1985) (searches of mobile homes); O’Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709 (1987) (searches of offices of government employees).  Our intricate body of law regarding “reasonable expectation of privacy” has been developed largely as a means of creating these exceptions, enabling a search to be denominated not a Fourth Amendment “search” and therefore not subject to the general warrant requirement.  Cf. id., at 729 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Unlike the dissent, therefore, I do not regard today’s holding as some momentous departure, but rather as merely the continuation of an inconsistent jurisprudence that has been with us for years.  Cases like United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977), and Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1979), have taken the “preference for a warrant” seriously, while cases like United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 (1982), and Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925), have not.  There can be no clarity in this area unless we make up our minds, and unless the principles we express comport with the actions we take.  In my view, the path out of this confusion should be sought by returning to the first principle that the “reasonableness” requirement of the Fourth Amendment affords the protection that the common law afforded.  See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, ante, at 60 (Scalia, J., dissenting); People v. Chiagles, 237 N. Y. 193, 195 , 142 N. E. 583 (1923) (Cardozo, J.).  Cf. California v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621, 624-627 (1991).  I have no difficulty with the proposition that that includes the requirement of a warrant, where the common law required a warrant; and it may even be that changes in the surrounding legal rules (for example, elimination of the common-law rule that reasonable, good-faith belief was no defense to absolute liability for trespass, Little v. Barreme, 2 Cranch 170 (1804) (Marshall, C. J.); see generally Amar, Of Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L. J. 1425, 1486-1487 (1987)), may make a warrant indispensable to reasonableness where it once was not.  But the supposed “gen *584 eral rule” that a warrant is always required does not appear to have any basis in the common law, see, e. g., Carroll, supra, at 150-153 ; Gelston v. Hoyt, 3 Wheat. 246, 310-311 (1818) (Story, J.); Wakely, supra, and confuses rather than facilitates any attempt to develop rules of reasonableness in light of changed legal circumstances, as the anomaly eliminated and the anomaly created by today’s holding both demonstrate.

 Once the police have *589 luggage “under their exclusive control, there [i]s not the slightest danger that the [luggage] or its contents could [be] removed before a valid search warrant could be obtained.  .  .  .  With the [luggage] safely immobilized, it [i]s unreasonable to undertake the additional and greater intrusion of a search without a warrant” (footnote omitted).  Ibid. Two Terms after Chadwick , we decided a case in which the relevant facts were identical to those before the Court today.  In Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1979), the police had probable cause to search a green suitcase that had been placed in the trunk of a taxicab at the Little Rock Airport.  Several blocks from the airport, they stopped the cab, arrested the passengers, seized the suitcase and, without obtaining a warrant, opened and searched it.  The Arkansas Supreme Court held that the search was unconstitutional.  Relying on Chadwick , the state court had no difficulty in concluding that there was “nothing in this set of circumstances that would lend credence to an assertion of impracticability in obtaining a search warrant.” Sanders v. State, 262 Ark. 595, 600 , 559 S. W. 2d 704, 706 (1977).  Over the dissent of Justice Blackmun and then-JusTiCE Rehnquist, both of whom had also dissented in Chadwick , this Court affirmed.  In his opinion for the Court, Justice Powell noted that the seizure of the green suitcase was entirely proper, 4 but that the State nevertheless had the burden of justifying the warrantless search, 5 and that it had “failed to *590 carry its burden of demonstrating the need for warrantless searches of luggage properly taken from automobiles.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 763</citedDecision> .  Chief Justice Burger wrote separately to identify the distinction between cases in which police have probable cause to believe contraband is located somewhere in a vehicle — the typical automobile exception case — and eases like Chadwick and Sanders in which they had probable cause to search a particular container before it was placed in the car. He wrote: “Because the police officers had probable cause to believe that respondent’s green suitcase contained marihuana before it was placed in the trunk of the taxicab, their duty to obtain a search warrant before opening it is clear under United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977).  The essence of our holding in Chadwick is that there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of a trunk or suitcase accompanying or being carried by a person; that expectation of privacy is not diminished simply because the owner’s arrest occurs in a public place.  Whether arrested in a hotel lobby, an airport, a railroad terminal, or on a public street, as here, the owner has the right to expect that the contents of his luggage will not, without his consent, be exposed on demand of the police.  .  .  .  “The breadth of the Court’s opinion and its repeated references to the ‘automobile’ from which respondent’s suitcase was seized at the time of his arrest, however, might lead the reader to believe — as the dissenters apparently do — that this case involves the ‘automobile’ exception to the warrant requirement.  See ante, at 762-765, and n. 14.  It does not.  Here, as in Chadwick , it was the luggage being transported by respondent at *591 the time of the arrest, not the automobile in which it was being carried, that was the suspected locus of the contraband.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 766-767</citedDecision> (opinion concurring in judgment).  Chief Justice Burger thus carefully explained that Sanders, which the Court overrules today, “simply d[id] not present the question of whether a warrant is required before opening luggage when the police have probable cause to believe contraband is located someiohere in the vehicle, but when they do not know whether, for example, it is inside a piece of luggage in the trunk, in the glove compartment, or concealed in some part of the car’s structure.” Id., at 767.  We confronted that question in United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 (1982).  6 We held in Ross that “the scope of the warrantless search authorized by [the automobile] exception is no broader and no narrower than a magistrate could legitimately authorize by warrant.” See id., at 825 .  The inherent mobility of the vehicle justified the immediate search without a warrant, but did not affect the scope of the search.  See id., at 822 .  Thus, the search could encompass containers, which might or might not conceal the object of the search, as well as the remainder of the vehicle.

 Once a lawful search has begun, it is also far more likely that it will not exceed proper bounds when it is done pursuant to a judicial authorization ‘particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.’ Further, a warrant assures the individual whose property is searched or seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer, his need to search, and the limits of his power to search.” Id., at 9.  See id., at 10-11.  The earliest case cited by Chief Justice Burger was Justice Field’s opinion in Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733 (1878).  “Having probable cause to believe that .contraband was being driven away in the taxi, the police were justified in stopping the vehicle, searching it on the spot, and seizing the suitcase they suspected contained contraband.  See Chambers v. Maroney, [ 399 U. S. 42, 52 (1970)].  At oral argument, respondent conceded that the stopping of the taxi and the seizure of the suitcase were constitutionally unobjectionable.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30, 44-46.” <citedDecision>Arkansas</citedDecision> v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 761-762</citedDecision> .  “[B]ecause each exception to the warrant requirement invariably impinges to some extent on the protective purpose of the Fourth Amendment, the few situations in which a search may be conducted in the absence of a warrant have been carefully delineated and ‘the burden is on those *590 seeking the exemption to show the need for it.’ United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48, 51 (1951).” Id., at 759-760.  ’In framing the question for decision we stated: “Unlike Chadwick and Sanders, in this case police officers had probable cause to search respondent’s entire vehicle.” 456 U. S., at 817 .  Moreover, we quoted the following paragraph from Justice Powell’s opinion concurring in the judgment in the intervening case of Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 (1981): “ ‘[W]hen the police have probable cause to search an automobile, rather than only to search a particular container that fortuitously is located in it, the exigencies that allow the police to search the entire automobile without a warrant support the warrantless search of every container found therein.  See post, at 451, and n. 13 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This analysis is entirely consistent with the holdings in Chadwick and Sanders, neither of which is an ‘automobile case,’ because the police there had probable cause to search the double-locked footlocker and the suitcase respectively before either came near an automobile.’ ” Id., at 435, quoted in United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 816 (1982).  Although the Court today purports to acknowledge that the warrant requirement is the general rule, ante, at 580, it nonetheless inexplicably persists in referring to Chadwick and Sanders as announcing a “separate rule, unique to luggage and other closed packages, bags, and containers.” Ante, at 571.

 Once a lawful search has begun, it is also far more likely that it will not exceed proper bounds when it is done pursuant to a judicial authorization ‘particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.’ Further, a warrant assures the individual whose property is searched or seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer, his need to search, and the limits of his power to search.” Id., at 9.  See id., at 10-11.  The earliest case cited by Chief Justice Burger was Justice Field’s opinion in Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733 (1878).  “Having probable cause to believe that .contraband was being driven away in the taxi, the police were justified in stopping the vehicle, searching it on the spot, and seizing the suitcase they suspected contained contraband.  See Chambers v. Maroney, [ 399 U. S. 42, 52 (1970)].  At oral argument, respondent conceded that the stopping of the taxi and the seizure of the suitcase were constitutionally unobjectionable.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30, 44-46.” <citedDecision>Arkansas</citedDecision> v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 761-762</citedDecision> .  “[B]ecause each exception to the warrant requirement invariably impinges to some extent on the protective purpose of the Fourth Amendment, the few situations in which a search may be conducted in the absence of a warrant have been carefully delineated and ‘the burden is on those *590 seeking the exemption to show the need for it.’ United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48, 51 (1951).” Id., at 759-760.  ’In framing the question for decision we stated: “Unlike Chadwick and Sanders, in this case police officers had probable cause to search respondent’s entire vehicle.” 456 U. S., at 817 .  Moreover, we quoted the following paragraph from Justice Powell’s opinion concurring in the judgment in the intervening case of Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 (1981): “ ‘[W]hen the police have probable cause to search an automobile, rather than only to search a particular container that fortuitously is located in it, the exigencies that allow the police to search the entire automobile without a warrant support the warrantless search of every container found therein.  See post, at 451, and n. 13 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This analysis is entirely consistent with the holdings in Chadwick and Sanders, neither of which is an ‘automobile case,’ because the police there had probable cause to search the double-locked footlocker and the suitcase respectively before either came near an automobile.’ ” Id., at 435, quoted in United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 816 (1982).  Although the Court today purports to acknowledge that the warrant requirement is the general rule, ante, at 580, it nonetheless inexplicably persists in referring to Chadwick and Sanders as announcing a “separate rule, unique to luggage and other closed packages, bags, and containers.” Ante, at 571.
