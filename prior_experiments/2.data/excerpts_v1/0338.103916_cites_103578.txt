**Combined Opinion**
But though we assume the validity of the patent and accept fully the findings of the Circuit Court of Appeals, we think the judgment below should be reversed. Ever since Henry v. A.B. Dick Co., 224 U.S. 1 , was overruled by Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U.S. 502 , this Court has consistently held that the owner of a patent may not employ it to secure a limited monopoly of an unpatented material used in applying the invention. Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., supra ; Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., supra ; Morton Salt *665 Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co., 314 U.S. 488 ; B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, 314 U.S. 495 . In those cases both direct and contributory infringement suits were disallowed on a showing that the owner of the patent was using it "as the effective means of restraining competition with its sale of an unpatented article." Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co., supra, p. 490. The Court has repeatedly held that to allow such suits would be to extend the aid of a court of equity in expanding the patent beyond the legitimate scope of its monopoly. It is true that those cases involved the use of the patent for a machine or process to secure a partial monopoly in supplies consumed in its operation or unpatented materials employed in it. But we can see no difference in principle where the unpatented material or device is itself an integral part of the structure embodying the patent.
**Combined Opinion**
[3] I should affirm the judgment. MR. JUSTICE REED joins in this opinion. MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting: The Court holds in effect that the owner of a patent who exacts, as the condition of a license, that unpatented materials used in connection with the invention shall be purchased only from the licensor cannot obtain relief from equity against one who supplies such unpatented materials even though the unpatented appliance was not for common use but was designedly adapted for the practice of the invention, but when so used did not involve an infringement of the patent. The decision is thus merely an appropriate application of what has come to be known as the doctrine in the Carbice case, 283 U.S. 27 . In this view I concur. But in the series of cases in which that doctrine has heretofore been applied ( Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U.S. 502 ; Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., supra ; Morton Salt Co. v. Suppiger Co., 314 *677 U.S. 488; B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, 314 U.S. 495 ), not once has this Court found it relevant to reject, either explicitly or by indirection, another doctrine of the law, that of contributory infringement, nor has it seen fit to make animadversions upon it. This is so doubtless for the simple reason that appropriate occasions for relief against contributory infringement are unrelated to the circumstances which bring the Carbice doctrine into play. In a word, if there is no infringement of a patent there can be no contributory infringer. Within its true limits the idea of contributory infringement was woven into the fabric of our law and has been part of it for now more than seventy years.
