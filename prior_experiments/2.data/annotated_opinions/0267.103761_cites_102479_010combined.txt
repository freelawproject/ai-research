We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari because of the public importance of the problem. We agree with the court below that this was a maritime tort over which the admiralty court has jurisdiction. Vancouver S.S. Co. v.

And we may assume that petitioner could have sued either the United States or the Commission under the Suits in Admiralty Act. In any event, such a suit would be the exclusive remedy in admiralty against either of them. Eastern Transportation Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 675 ; Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Rosenberg Bros. & Co., 276 U.S. 202 .
