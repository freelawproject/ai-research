**Combined Opinion**
Mr. Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court. Once again we are presented with “ 'the perennial problem of the validity of a state tax for the privilege of carrying on, within a state, certain activities’ related to a corporation’s operation of an interstate business.” Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U. S. 100, 101 (1975), quoting Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, <citedDecision>335 U. S. 80, 85</citedDecision> (1948).  The issue in this case is whether Mississippi runs afoul of the Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, when it applies the tax it imposes on “the privilege of .  .  .  doing business” within the State to appellant’s activity in interstate commerce.  The Supreme Court of Mississippi unanimously sustained the tax against *275 appellant’s constitutional challenge.  330 So. 2d 268 (1976).

 has long since been discarded as being in itself sufficient to outlaw state legislation.” Id., at 265-266 .  In his view, a state tax is unconsti *281 tutional only if the activity lacks the necessary connection with the taxing state to give “jurisdiction to tax,” id., at 271 , or if the tax discriminates against interstate commerce, or if the activity is subject to multiple taxation.  Id., at 276-277 .  10 The rule announced in Freeman was viewed in the commentary as a triumph of formalism over substance, providing little guidance even as to formal requirements.  See P. Hartman, State Taxation of Interstate Commerce 200-204 (1953); Dunham, Gross Receipts Taxes on Interstate Transactions, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 211 (1947).  Although the rule might have been utilized as the keystone of a movement toward absolute immunity of interstate commerce from state taxation, 11 the Court consistently has indicated that “interstate commerce may be made to pay its way,” and has moved toward a standard of permissibility of state taxation based upon its actual effect rather than its legal terminology.  The narrowing of the rule to one of draftsmanship and phraseology began with another Mississippi case, Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, <citedDecision>335 U. S. 80</citedDecision> (1948).  Memphis Natural Gas Company owned and operated a pipeline running from Louisiana to Memphis.  Approximately 135 miles of the line were in Mississippi.  Mississippi imposed a “franchise or excise” tax measured by “the value of the capital used, invested or employed in the exercise of any power, privilege or right enjoyed by [a corporation] within this state.” Miss. Code Ann., 1942, § 9313.  The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the tax, and this Court affirmed.  In an opinion for himself and two others, Mr. Justice Reed *282 noted that the tax was not discriminatory, that there was no possibility of multiple taxation, that the amount of the tax was reasonable, and that the tax was properly apportioned to the investment in Mississippi.  <citedDecision>335 U. S., at 87-88</citedDecision> .  He then went on to consider whether the tax was “upon the privilege of doing interstate business within the state.” <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 88</citedDecision> .  He drew a distinction between a tax on “the privilege of doing interstate business” and a tax on “the privilege of exercising corporate functions within the State,” and held that while the former is unconstitutional, the latter is not barred by the Commerce Clause.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 88-93</citedDecision> .  He then approved the tax there at issue because “there is no attempt to tax the privilege of doing an interstate business or to secure anything from the corporation by this statute except compensation for the protection of the enumerated local activities of 'maintaining, keeping in repair, and otherwise in manning the facilities.’ ” <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 93</citedDecision> .  Mr. Justice Black concurred in the judgment without opinion.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 96</citedDecision> .  Mr. Justice Rutledge provided the fifth vote, stating in his concurrence: “[I]t is enough for me to sustain the tax imposed in this case that it is one clearly within the state’s power to lay insofar as any limitation of due process or 'jurisdiction to tax’ in that sense is concerned; it is nondiscriminatory, that is, places no greater burden upon interstate commerce than the state places upon competing intrastate commerce of like character; is duly apportioned, that is, does not undertake to tax any interstate activities carried on outside the state’s borders; and cannot be repeated by any other state.” <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 96-97</citedDecision> (footnotes omitted).  Four Justices dissented, <citedDecision>
   id.,
  
  at 99</citedDecision> , on the grounds that it had not been shown that the State afforded any protection in *283 return for the tax, 12 and that, therefore, the tax must be viewed as one on the “privilege” of engaging in interstate commerce.  The dissenters recognized that an identical effect could be achieved by an increase in the ad valorem property tax, <citedDecision>
   id.,
  
  at 104</citedDecision> , but would have held, notwithstanding, that a tax on the “privilege” is unconstitutional.  The prohibition against state taxation of the “privilege” of engaging in commerce that is interstate was reaffirmed in Spector Motor Service v. O’Connor, 340 U. S. 602 (1951), a case similar on its facts to the instant case. The taxpayer there was a Missouri corporation engaged exclusively in interstate trucking.  Some of its shipments originated or terminated in Connecticut.  Connecticut imposed on a corporation a “tax or excise upon its franchise for the privilege of carrying on or doing business within the state,” measured by apportioned net income.  Id., at 603-604, n. 1 .  Spector brought suit in federal court to enjoin collection of the tax as applied to its activities.  The District Court issued the injunction.

 .  This limitation on State power .  .  .  does not merely forbid a State to single out interstate commerce for hostile action.  A State is also precluded from taking any action which may fairly be deemed to have the effect of impeding the free flow of trade between States.  It is immaterial that local commerce is subjected to a similar encumbrance.” 8 See, e. g., General Motors Corp. v. Washington, supra; Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959); Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, <citedDecision>335 U. S. 80</citedDecision> (1948); Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435, 444 (1940).  9 Although we mention Freeman as the starting point, elements of the views expressed therein, and the positions that underlie that debate, were evident in prior opinions.  Compare State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, 15 Wall. 284 (1873), with Fargo v. Michigan, 121 U. S. 230 (1887); and compare Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, 273 U. S. 34 (1927), and Cooney v. Mountain States Tel. Co., 294 U. S. 384 (1935), with Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938).  See generally P. Hartman, State Taxation of Interstate Commerce (1953); Barrett, State Taxation of Interstate Commerce—“Direct Burdens,” “Multiple Burdens,” or What *280 Have You?, 4 Vand. L. Rev. 496 (1951), and writings cited therein at 496 n. 1; Dunham, Gross Receipts Taxes on Interstate Transactions, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 211 (1947).  10 Mr. Justice Rutledge agreed with the result the Court reached in Freeman because of his belief that the apportionment problem was best solved if States other than the market State were forbidden to impose unapportioned gross receipts taxes of the kind Indiana sought to exact.  11 A consistent application of the doctrine of immunity for interstate commerce, of course, would have necessitated overruling the cases approved by the Freeman Court that upheld taxes whose burden, although indirect, fell on interstate commerce.  12 In arriving at this conclusion, the dissent relied upon a construction of a stipulation entered into by the parties, <citedDecision>335 U. S., at 100-101</citedDecision> , and upon an independent review of the record.  The plurality rejected the dissent’s reading of the stipulation and noted, in addition, that the question presented in the petition for certiorari did not raise a claim that the State was providing no service for which it could ask recompense.  <citedDecision>
    Id.,
   
   at 83-84</citedDecision> .  The plurality then relied on the Supreme Court of Mississippi’s holding that the State did provide protection that could properly be the subject of a tax. 13 Five Members of the Court joined in the opinion distinguishing Spector.  Two concurred in the judgment, but viewed Spector as indistinguishable and would have overruled it.  421 U. S., at 114-116 .  One also viewed Spector as indistinguishable, but felt that it was an established precedent until forthrightly overruled.  Id., at 116 .  Mr. Justice Douglas took no part.
