 VII From .1919 until 1933, the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution totally prohibited “the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors” in the United States and its territories.  Section 1 of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed that prohibition, and § 2 delegated to the several States the power to prohibit commerce in, or the use of, alcoholic beverages.  21 The States’ regulatory power over this segment of commerce is therefore largely “unfettered *515 by the Commerce Clause.” Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves, 308 U. S. 132, 138 (1939).  As is clear, the text of the Twenty-first Amendment supports the view that, while it grants the States authority over commerce that might otherwise be reserved to the Federal Government, it places no limit whatsoever on other constitutional provisions.  Nevertheless, Rhode Island argues, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that in this case the Twenty-first Amendment tilts the First Amendment analysis in the State’s favor.  See 39 F. 3d, at 7-8 .  In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on our decision in California v. LaRue, <citedDecision>409 U. S. 109</citedDecision> (1972).  22 In <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> , five Members of the Court relied on the Twenty-first Amendment to buttress the conclusion that the First Amendment did not invalidate California’s prohibition of certain grossly sexual exhibitions in premises licensed to serve alcoholic beverages.  Specifically, the opinion stated that the Twenty-first Amendment required that the prohibition be given an added presumption in favor of its validity.  See <citedDecision>id., at 118-119</citedDecision> .  We are now persuaded that the Court’s analysis in <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> would have led to precisely the same result if it had placed no reliance on the Twenty-first Amendment.  Entirely apart from the Twenty-first Amendment, the State has ample power to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages in inappropriate locations.  Moreover, in subsequent cases, the Court has recognized that the States’ inherent police powers provide ample authority to restrict the kind of “bacchanalian revelries” described in the <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> opinion regardless of whether alcoholic beverages are involved.  <citedDecision>Id., at 118</citedDecision> ; see, e. g., Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560 (1991).  As we recently noted: “LaRue did not involve *516 commercial speech about alcohol, but instead concerned the regulation of nude dancing in places where alcohol was served.” Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 483, n. 2 .  Without questioning the holding in <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> , we now disavow its reasoning insofar as it relied on the Twenty-first Amendment.  As we explained in a case decided more than a decade after <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> , although the Twenty-first Amendment limits the effect of the dormant Commerce Clause on a State’s regulatory power over the delivery or use of intoxicating beverages within its borders, “the Amendment does not license the States to ignore their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution.” Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 712 (1984).  That general conclusion reflects our specific holdings that the Twenty-first Amendment does not in any way diminish the force of the Supremacy Clause, ibid.; California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, 112-114 (1980), the Establishment Clause, Larkin v. Grendel’s Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116, 122, n. 5 (1982), or the Equal Protection Clause, Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 209 (1976).  We see no reason why the First Amendment should not also be included in that list.  Accordingly, we now hold that the Twenty-first Amendment does not qualify the constitutional prohibition against laws abridging the freedom of speech embodied in the First Amendment.  The Twenty-first Amendment, therefore, cannot save Rhode Island’s ban on liquor price advertising.  VIII Because Rhode Island has failed to carry its heavy burden of justifying its complete ban on price advertising, we conclude that R. I.  Gen. Laws §§3-8-7 and 3-8-8.1 (1987), as well as Regulation 32 of the Rhode Island Liquor Control Administration, abridge speech in violation of the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

 We recently held that although the government had the power to proscribe an entire category of speech, such as obscenity or so-called fighting words, it could not limit the scope of its ban to obscene or fighting words that expressed a point of view with which the government disagrees.  R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377 (1992).  Similarly, in Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410 (1993), we assumed that States could prevent all newsracks from being placed on public sidewalks, but nevertheless concluded that they could not ban only those newsracks that contained certain commercial publications.  Id., at 428 .  “Section 2.  The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 21, § 2.  The State also relies on two per curiam opinions that followed the Twenty-first Amendment analysis set forth in <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> .  See New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U. S. 714 (1981), and Newport v. Iacobucci, 479 U. S. 92 (1986).
