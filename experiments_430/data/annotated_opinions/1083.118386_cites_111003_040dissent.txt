 made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublie nature of the institution benefitted” would be permissible.  Id., at 783, n. 38 (citations omitted).  Subsequent eases continued the focus on the “generality^ of the approved government services as an important characteristic.  Meek , for example, characterized Everson and Allen as approving “a general program” to pay bus fares and to lend school books, respectively, 421 U. S., at 360 ; id., at 360, n. 8 (approving two similar “general program[s]” in New York and Pennsylvania), and Wolman upheld diagnostic services described as “ ‘general welfare services for children,’” 433 U.S., at 243 (quoting Meek, supra, at 371, n. 21 ).  *882 Justice Blaekmun, writing in Roemer , first called such a “general” or evenhanded program “neutral,” in speaking of “facial neutrality’ as a relevant consideration in determining whether there was an Establishment Clause violation.  “[RJeligious institutions need not be quarantined from public benefits that are neutrally available to all.” 426 U. S., at 746-747 ; see also id., at 746 (discussing buses in Everson and school books in Allen as examples of “neutrally available” aid).  In Mueller v. Allen, <citedDecision>463 U. S. 388</citedDecision> (1983), the Court adopted the redefinition of neutrality as evenhandedness, citing Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38 , and alluding to our discussion of equal access in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981).  The Court upheld a system of tax deductions for sectarian educational expenses, in part because such a “facially neutral law,” <citedDecision>463 U. S., at 401</citedDecision> , made the deduction available for “all parents, including those whose children attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools,” <citedDecision>id., at 397</citedDecision> .  Subsequent cases carried the point forward.  See, e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487 (1986) (quoting Nyquist and characterizing program as making aid “available generally”); Zobrest, swpra, at 8-9 (discussing “government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion” and citing <citedDecision>Mueller</citedDecision> and Witters); Agos-tini, supra, at 231 (discussing aid allocated on the basis of “neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, .  .  .  made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis”); see also Rosen-berger, 515 U. S., at 839 (“[T]he guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse”).  In sum, “neutrality” originally entered this field of jurisprudence as a eonelusory term, a label for the required rela *883 tionship between the government and religion as a state of equipoise between government as ally and government as adversary.  Reexamining Everson’s paradigm cases to derive a prescriptive guideline, we first determined that "neutral” aid was secular, nonideologieal, or unrelated to religious education.  Our subsequent reexamination of Everson and Allen, beginning in Nyquist and culminating in <citedDecision>Mueller</citedDecision> and most recently in Agostini , recast neutrality as a concept of "evenhandedness.” There is, of course, good reason for considering the generality of aid and the evenhandedness of its distribution in making close calls between benefits that in purpose or effect support a school’s religious mission and those that do not.  This is just what Everson did.  Even when the disputed practice falls short of Everson’s paradigms, the breadth of evenhanded distribution is one pointer toward the law’s purpose, since on the face of it aid distributed generally and without a religious criterion is less likely to be meant to aid religion than a benefit going only to religious institutions or people.  And, depending on the breadth of distribution, looking to evenhandedness is a way of asking whether a benefit can reasonably be seen to aid religion in fact; we do not regard the postal system as aiding religion, even though parochial schools get mail.  Given the legitimacy of considering evenhandedness, then, there is no reason to avoid the term “neutrality” to refer to it.  But one crucial point must be borne in mind.  In the days when "neutral” was used in Everson’s sense of equipoise, neutrality was tantamount to constitutionality; the term was eonclusory, but when it applied it meant that the government’s position was constitutional under the Establishment Clause.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 677-678 (opinion of Burger, C. J.) (acknowledging “no single constitutional caliper”); Meek, 421 U. S., at 358-359 (noting considerations as guidelines only and discussing them as a matter of degree); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 383 (1985) (quoting Meek), overruled in part by Agostini, 521 U. S., at 203 ; Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 720 (1994) (opinion of O’Connor, J.) (“Experience proves that the Establishment Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single test”); Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 847-849 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (discussing need for line-drawing); id., at 852 (noting lack of a single “Grand Unified Theory” for Establishment Clause and citing Kiryas Joel)', ef.  Agostini, supra, at 232-233 (examining a variety of factors).  Thus, the basic principle of establishment scrutiny of aid remains the principle as stated in Everson , that there may be no public aid to religion or support for the religious mission of any institution.  B The insufficiency of evenhandedness neutrality as a standalone criterion of constitutional intent or effect has been clear from the beginning of our interpretative efforts, for an obvious reason.  Evenhandedness in distributing a benefit approaches the equivalence of constitutionality in this area only when the term refers to such universality of distribution that it makes no sense to think of the benefit as going to any discrete group.  Conversely, when evenhandedness refers to distribution to limited groups within society, like groups of schools or schoolchildren, it does make sense to regard the benefit as aid to the recipients.  See, e. g., Everson, 330 U. S., *885 at 16 (discussing aid that approaches the “verge” of forbidden territory); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 612 (“[W]e can only dimly perceive the lines of demarcation in this extraordinarily sensitive area of constitutional law”); Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 760-761 (noting the “most perplexing questions” presented in this area and acknowledging “‘entangling] precedents’”); Mueller, <citedDecision>463 U. S., at 393</citedDecision> (quoting Lemon); Witters, 474 U. S., at 485 (quoting Lemon).  Hence, if we looked no further than evenhandedness, and failed to ask what activities the aid might support, or in fact did support, religious schools could be blessed with government funding as massive as expenditures made for the benefit of their public school counterparts, and religious missions would thrive on public money.  This is why the consideration of less than universal neutrality has never been recognized as dispositive and has always been teamed with attention to other facts bearing on the substantive prohibition of support for a school’s religious objective.  At least three main lines of enquiry addressed particularly to school aid have emerged to complement evenhandedness neutrality.  First, we have noted that two types of aid recipients heighten Establishment Clause concern: pervasively religious schools and primary and secondary religious schools.  Second, we have identified two important characteristics of the method of distributing aid: directness or indirectness of distribution and distribution by genuinely independent choice.  Third, we have found relevance in at least five characteristics of the aid itself: its religious content; its cash form; its divertibility or actually diversion to religious support; its supplantation of traditional items of religious school expense; and its substantiality.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 *888 2 We have also evaluated the portent of support to an organization’s religious mission that may be inherent in the method by which aid is granted, finding pertinence in at least two characteristics of distribution.  First, we have asked whether aid is direct or indirect, observing distinctions between government schemes with individual beneficiaries and those whose beneficiaries in the first instance might be religious schools.  Everson, supra, at 18 (bus fare supports parents and not schools); Allen, 392 U. S., 243 -244, and n. 6 (textbooks go to benefit children and parents, not schools); Lemon, supra, at 621 (invalidating direct aid to schools); Levitt, supra, at 480, 482 (invalidating direct testing aid to schools); Witters, 474 U. S., at 487-488 (evaluating whether aid was a direct subsidy to schools).  Direct aid obviously raises greater risks, although recent eases have discounted this risk factor, looking to other features of the distribution mechanism.  Agostini, supra, at 225-226 .  8 *889 Second, we have distinguished between indirect aid that reaches religious schools only incidentally as a result of numerous individual choices and aid that is in reality directed to religious schools by the government or in practical terms selected by religious schools themselves.  Mueller, <citedDecision>463 U. S., at 399</citedDecision> ; Witters, supra, at 488 ; Zobrest, supra, at 10 .  In these cases, we have declared the constitutionality of programs providing aid directly to parents or students as tax deductions or scholarship money, where such aid may pay for education at some sectarian institutions, <citedDecision>Mueller, supra, at 399</citedDecision> ; Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , but only as the result of “genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients,” id., at 487 .  We distinguished this path of aid from the route in Ball and Wolman , where the opinions indicated that “[wjhere ... no meaningful distinction can be made between aid to the student and aid to the school, the concept of a loan to individuals is a transparent fiction.” 474 U. S., at 487, n. 4 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  9 3 In addition to the character of the school to which the benefit accrues, and its path from government to school, a number of features of the aid itself have figured in the elassifica- *890 tions we have made.  First, we have barred aid with actual religious content, which would obviously run afoul of the ban on the government’s participation in religion, Everson, 330 U. S., at 16 ; Walz, 397 U. S., at 668 ; cf. Lemon, 403 U. S., at 617 (discussing variable ideological and religious character of religious teachers compared to fixed content of books).  In eases where we have permitted aid, we have regularly characterized it as “neutral” in the sense (noted supra, at 879-881) of being without religious content.  See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 688 (characterizing buildings as “religiously neutral”); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (describing translator as “neutral service”); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 232 (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was “neutral and nonideological”).  See also ante, at 820 (plurality opinion) (barring aid with religious content).
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The plurality misreads our precedent in suggesting that we have abandoned directness of distribution as a relevant consideration.  See ante, at 815-818.  In Wolman, we stated that nominally describing aid as to students would not bar a court from finding that it actually provided a subsidy to a school, 433 U. S., at 250 , but we did not establish that a program giving “direct” aid to schools was therefore permissible.  In Witters , we made the focus of Wolman dear, continuing to examine aid to determine *889 if it was a “direct subsidy” to a school, 474 U. S., at 487 , and distinguishing the aid at issue from impermissible aid in Ball and Wolman precisely because the designation of the student as recipient in those eases was only nominal.  474 U. S., at 487, n. 4 .  Our subsequent cases have continued to ask whether government aid programs constituted impermissible “direct subsidies” to religious schools even where they are directed by individual choice.  Zobrest, supra, at 11-13; Mueller v. Allen, <citedDecision>463 U. S. 388, 399</citedDecision> (1983); Agostini, supra, at 226 .  We have also permitted the government to supply students with public-employee translators, Zobrest, supra, at 10, and public-employee special education teachers, Agostini, supra, at 226,228 , who directly provided .them with government services in whatever schools those specific students attended, public or nonpublic.  I have already noted Agostini’s limitations.  See n. 8, supra. 1 agree with the plurality that the Establishment Clause absolutely prohibits the government from providing aid with dear religious content to religious, or for that matter nonreligious, schools.  Ante, at 822-825.  The plurality, however, misreads our precedent as focusing only on affirmatively religious content.  At the very least, a building, for example, has no such content, but we have squarely required the government to ensure that no publidy financed building be diverted to religious use.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 In that case, we found the other safeguards against the diversion of such funds to religious uses sufficient to allow such aid: “A *892 contrary view would insist on drawing a constitutional distinction between paying the nonpublic school to do the grading and paying state employees or some independent service to perform that task, even though the grading function is the same regardless of who performs it and would not have the primary effect of aiding religion whether or not performed by nonpublic school personnel.” Id., at 658 .  Aside from this isolated circumstance, where we found ironclad guarantees of nondiversion, we have never relaxed our prohibition on direct cash aid to pervasively religious schools, and have in fact continued to acknowledge the concern.  See Agostini , 521U.  S., at 228-229; cf. Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 .  The plurality concedes this basic point.  See ante, at 818-819.  Given this, I find any suggestion that this prohibition has been undermined by <citedDecision>Mueller</citedDecision> or Witters without foundation.  See ante, at 819-820, n. 8.  Those cases involved entirely different types of aid, namely, tax deductions and individual scholarship aid for university education, see also n. 16, infra, and were followed by Rosenberger and Agostini , which continued to support this absolute restriction.  I reject the plurality’s argument that divertibility is a boundless principle.  Ante, at 824-825.  Our long experience of evaluating this consideration demonstrates its practical limits.  See infra this page and 894-895.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Zobrest does not reject the principle of divertibility.  There the government provided only a translator who was not considered divertible because he did not add to or subtract from the religious message.  The Court approved the translator as it would approve a hearing aid, health services, diagnostics, and tests.  See Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 13, and n. 10.  Cf Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U. S. 291, 299-300 (1899); Wolman, 433 U. S., at 244 .  Zobrest thus can be thought of as akin to our approval of diagnostic services in Wolman, supra, at 244 , which we considered to have “little or no educational content[,] not [to be] closely associated with the educational mission of the nonpublie school,” and not to pose “an impermissible *896 risk of the fostering of ideological views.” The fact that the dissent saw things otherwise (as the plurality points out, ante, at 821) is beside the point here.  Similarly, the plurality is mistaken in reading our holdings in <citedDecision>Mueller</citedDecision> and Witters , see ante, at 821, to undermine divertibility as a relevant principle.  First, these cases approved quite factually distinct types of aid; <citedDecision>Mueller</citedDecision> involving tax deductions, which have a quite separate history of approval, see 468 U. S., at 396, and nn. 5, 6 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970», and Witters involving scholarship money distributed to a university, not a primary or secondary school, see Tilton, 403 U. S., at 685-686 , that was not significant enough as a whole to support that institution, Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 .  Second, in neither case did the program at issue provide direct aid on a schoolwide basis (as Chapter 2 does here); in both we found a distinction based on the genuinely independent, private choices which allocated such very different types of aid (tax deductions and university scholarship money that did not amount to substantial support of the university).  See <citedDecision>Mueller, supra, at 399</citedDecision> ; Witters, supra, at 488 .  Our departure from this principle in Regan is not easily explained, but it is an isolated holding surrounded by otherwise unbroken adherence to the no-supplanting principle.  Long after Regan we have continued to find the supplement/supplant distinction, like the bar to substantial aid, to be an important consideration.  See Zobrest, supra, at 12; Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228 ; c£ Witters, supra, at 487-488 (discussing rule against "direct subsidy”).  The weight that the plurality places on Regan is thus too much for it to bear.  See ante, at 815, n. 7.  Moreover, the apparent object of the Regan Court's concern was vindicating the principle that aid with fixed secular content was permissible, distinguishing it from the divertible testing aid in Levitt.
