I cannot bring myself to believe that the Full Faith and Credit Clause gave to the few States which offer bargain-counter divorces constitutional power to control the social policy governing domestic relations of the many States which do not. [This is also a dissent to Coe v. Coe, post, p. 378.] Nor do I regard Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32, as contrary authority. That case did not depend for its result on the fact that there had been an adjudication of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the divorce enforced, inasmuch as this Court found that the State granting the divorce was in fact that of the domicile. 305 U. S. at 41. Moreover this Court’s citation therein of Andrews v. Andrews, *359 supra, indicates an absence of intention to overrule the holding of that case that opportunity to litigate the issue of domicile does not foreclose inquiry as to the true facts. Andrews v. Andrews has since been cited with respect, as recently as Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 309, 320, n. 7, and 325 U. S. 226, 229, 240, 242. Compare the English laws providing for a King’s Proctor to represent the interests of the Crown in divorce proceedings. Sections 5-7, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1860, 23 & 24 Vict., c. 144; § 1, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1873, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 31; § 181, The Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, 15 & 16 Geo. 5, c. 49, 9 Halsbury’s Statutes of England 393-94.

See S. 1960,80th Cong., 2d Sess. The most vigorous efforts, however, have been made in the direction of securing uniform State legislation. President Theodore Roosevelt, in calling on Congress to provide for compilation of marriage and divorce statistics, included a suggestion of cooperation among the States in enacting uniform laws. 15 Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents 6942. On the initiative of the Governor of Pennsylvania, a National Congress on Uniform Divorce Laws, in which forty-two States were represented, was called in 1906. This Congress resolved that a constitutional amendment was not feasible and drafted resolutions concerning uniform State legislation. Lich-tenberger, supra, 191-96. See also Proceedings, National Congress on Uniform Divorce Laws (1906) passim; Proceedings 2d Meeting of the Governors of the States of the Union (1910) pp. 185-98. It is interesting to note that even these proponents of uniformity advocated that each State “adopt a statute embodying the principle contained in” the very Massachusetts statute now held unconstitutional by the Court perhaps in the interests of uniformity. Lichtenberger, supra, at 194. The bill prepared by the Congress was also approved by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (Proceedings, 17th Ann. Conf., Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (1907) pp. 120 et seq.) but was adopted by only three States. See pp. 360-361, supra.
**Combined Opinion**
Respondent participated in the Florida proceedings by entering a general appearance, filing pleadings placing in issue the very matters he sought subsequently to contest in the Massachusetts courts, personally appearing before the Florida court and giving testimony in the case, and by retaining attorneys who represented him throughout the entire proceedings. It has not been contended that respondent was given less than a full opportunity to contest the issue of petitioner's domicile or any other issue relevant to the litigation. There is nothing to indicate that the Florida court would not have evaluated fairly and in good faith all relevant evidence submitted to it. Respondent does not even contend that on the basis of the evidence introduced in the Florida proceedings, that court reached an erroneous result on the issue of petitioner's domicile. If respondent failed to take advantage of the opportunities afforded him, the responsibility is his own. We do not believe that the dereliction of a defendant under such circumstances should be permitted to provide a basis for subsequent attack in the courts of a sister State on a decree valid in the State in which it was rendered. 17 It is suggested, however, that Andrews v. Andrews, 1903, 188 U.S. 14 , 23 S.Ct. 237 , 47 L.Ed. 366 , militates against the result we have reached. In that case a husband, who had been domiciled in Ms sachusetts, instituted divorce proceedings in a South Dakota court after having satisfied the residence requirements of that State. The wife appeared by counsel and filed pleadings challenging the husband's South Dakota domicile. Before the decree of divorce was granted, however, the wife, pursuant to a consent agreement between the parties, withdrew her appearance from the proceedings. Following the entry of the decree, the husband returned to Massachusetts and subsequently remarried. After his death a contest developed between his first and second wives as to the administration of the husband's estate.

Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U.S. 226 , 65 S.Ct. 1092 , 89 L.Ed. 1577 , 157 A.L.R. 1366 . A State that is asked to enforce the action of another State may appropriately ascertain whether that other State had power to do what it purported to do. And if the enforcing State has an interest under our Constitution in regard to the subject-matter that is vital and intimate, it should not be within the power of private parties to foreclose that interest by their private arrangement. Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U.S. 14 , 23 S.Ct. 237 , 47 L.Ed. 366 ; cf. Fall v. Eastin, 215 U.S. 1 , 30 S.Ct. 3 , 54 L.Ed. 65 , 23 L.R.A.,N.S., 924, 17 Ann.Cas. 853; Alaska Packers Association v.

The Commissioners eventually decided that no uniform law establishing substantive grounds for divorce could succeed, and replaced this proposal with the Uniform Divorce Jurisdiction Act, which would have accorded recognition to a wider range of decrees than were protected by Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U.S. 562 , 26 S.Ct.
