 See also Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 151-154 (1968) (tracing the history of trial by jury).  Ill Thus far, the resolution of the question before us seems simple.  The Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to demand that a jury find him guilty of all the elements of the crime with which he is charged; one of the elements in the present case is materiality; respondent therefore had a right to have the jury decide materiality.  To escape the force of this logic, the Government offers essentially three arguments.  Having conceded the minor premise — that materiality is an element of the offense — the Government argues first, that the major premise is flawed; second, that (essentially) a page of history is worth a volume of logic, and uniform practice simply excludes the element of materiality from the syllogism; and third, that stare decisis requires the judgment here to be reversed.  A As to the first, the Government’s position is that “materiality,” whether as a matter of logic or history, is a “legal” question, and that although we have sometimes spoken of “requiring the jury to decide ‘all the elements of a criminal offense,’ e. g., Estelle v. McGuire, [ 502 U. S. 62, 69 ] (1991); see Victor v. Nebraska, [ 511 U. S. 1, 5 ] (1994); Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977), the principle actually applies to only the factual components of the essential elements.” Brief for United States 33 (emphasis added).  The Government claims that this understanding of the jury’s role *512 dates back to Sparf v. United States, <citedDecision>156 U. S. 51</citedDecision> (1895), and is reaffirmed by recent decisions of this Court. By limiting the jury’s constitutionally prescribed role to “the factual components of the essential elements” the Government surely does not mean to concede that the jury must pass upon all elements that contain some factual component, for that test is amply met here.  Deciding whether a statement is “material” requires the determination of at least two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a) “what statement was made?” and (b) “what decision was the agency trying to make?” The ultimate question: (c) “whether the statement was material to the decision,” requires applying the legal standard of materiality (quoted above) to these historical facts.  What the Government apparently argues is that the Constitution requires only that (a) and (b) be determined by the jury, and that (c) may be determined by the judge. We see two difficulties with this.  First, the application-of-legal-standard-to-fact sort of question posed by (c), commonly called a “mixed question of law and fact,” has typically been resolved by juries.  See J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at Common Law 194, 249-250 (1898).  Indeed, our cases have recognized in other contexts that the materiality inquiry, involving as it does “delicate assessments of the inferences a ‘reasonable [decisionmaker]’ would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him,... [is] peculiarly on[e] for the trier of fact.” TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 450 (1976) (securities fraud); McLanahan v. Universal Ins. Co., 1 Pet. 170, 188-189, 191 (1828) (materiality of false statements in insurance applications).  The second difficulty with the Government’s position is that it has absolutely no historical support.

Rev. 867 , 912-913 (1994).  Justice Chase’s defense to one of the charges in his 1805 impeachment trial was that “he well knows, that it is the right of juries in criminal cases, to give a general verdict of acquittal, which cannot be set aside on account of its being contrary to law, and that hence results the power of juries, to decide on the law as well as on the facts, in all criminal cases. This power he holds to be a sacred part of our legal privileges .  .  .  .” IS.  Smith & T. Lloyd, Trial of Samuel Chase 34 (1805).  <citedDecision>Sparf, supra,</citedDecision> the case on which the Government relies, had nothing to do with the issue before us here.  The question there was whether the jury could be deprived of the power to determine, not only historical facts, not only mixed questions of fact and law, but pure questions of law in a criminal case. As the foregoing quotation from Justice Chase suggests, many thought the jury had such power.  See generally Alschuler & Deiss, supra, at 902-916.  We decided that it did not.  In criminal cases, as in civil, we held, the judge must be permitted to instruct the jury on the law and to insist that the jury follow his instructions.  <citedDecision>156 U. S., at 105-106</citedDecision> .  But our decision in no way undermined the historical and constitutionally guaranteed right of criminal defendants to demand that the jury decide guilt or innocence on every issue, which includes application of the law to the facts.  To the contrary, Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, explained the many judicial assertions of the jury’s *514 right to determine both law and fact as expressions of “the principle, that when the question is compounded of law and fact, a general verdict, ex necessitate, disposes of the case in hand, both as to law and fact.” <citedDecision>Id., at 90</citedDecision> (emphasis in original).  He gave as an example the 1807 treason trial of Aaron Burr in which Chief Justice Marshall charged the jury that “ ‘levying war is an act compounded of law and fact; of which the jury, aided by the court must judge. .  .  .  [And] hav[ing] now heard the opinion of the court on the law of the case[,3 [t]hey will apply that law to the facts, and will find a verdict of guilty or not guilty as their own consciences may direct.’ ” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 67 (quoting 2 Burr’s Trial 548 , 550 (D. Robertson ed. 1875)) (emphasis in original).  Other expressions of the same principle abound.  See United States v. Battiste, 24 F. Cas. 1042, 1043 (No. 14,545) (CC Mass. 1835) (Story, J., sitting as Circuit Justice) (the jury’s general verdict is “necessarily compounded of [both] law and fact”).  As Thayer wrote at the end of the 19th century: “From the beginning ... it was perceived that any general verdict, such as .  .  .  not guilty, involved a conclusion of law, and that the jury did, in a sense, in such cases answer a question of law.” Thayer, supra, at 253.
