**Dissenting Opinion**
 “The federal government is the government of all the States, and all the States share in the legislative process by which a tax of general applicability is laid.” Id., at 577 .  See M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405-406 (1819).  He also recognized that immunity in this area had been significantly eroded since it was first used to protect state officials from a federal tax in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871).  See, e. g., Graves v. New York ex rel. O’Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 (1939), overruling Collector v. Day, supra; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376 (1938); Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U. S. 123 (1932).  Even more significantly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out that the existence of a state immunity from federal taxation, to the extent that it was based on any vague sovereignty notions, was inconsistent with the holding in United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), that state sovereignty does not restrict federal exercise of the commerce power.  326 U. S., at 582 .  My Brethren's reliance on Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869), and Lane County v. <citedDecision>Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76</citedDecision> (1869), is puzzling to say the least.  The Brethren make passing reference to the unique historical setting in which those cases were decided, ante, at 844, but pointedly ignore the significance of the events of those days.  During the tenure of Mr. Chief Justice Chase, the War Between the States, fought to preserve the supremacy of the Union, was won; Congress and the States then enacted three constitutional Amendments, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, enlarging federal power and concomitantly contracting the States’ power, see Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 345 (1880); and Congress enacted a variety of laws during Reconstruction further restricting state *868 sovereignty.  Texas v. White itself noted that the Constitution empowered Congress to form a new government in a State if the citizens of that State were being denied a republican form of government.  7 Wall., at 729.  And the Court recognized in <citedDecision>Lane County</citedDecision> that “[t)he people of the United States constitute one nation, under one government, and this government, within the scope of the powers with which it is invested, is supreme.” 7 Wall., at 76.  Even those dissenting opinions, however, were more faithful to the Constitution than is today's decision.  They relied on the Tenth *869 Amendment to invalidate federal legislation only because they found the enactments not within the scope of the commerce power, and thus not within a power delegated to Congress.  More importantly, they made no distinction between private parties and States; in their view, what was not commerce for one was commerce for no one.  My Brethren today, however, arrive at their novel constitutional theory in defiance of the plain language of the Tenth Amendment, differentiating “the people” from “the States.” They apparently hold that a power delegated to Congress with respect to the former is, contrary to the clear wording of the Amendment, not delegated as to the latter, because this conclusion is more consonant with their view of a proper distribution of governmental power.  But, “however socially desirable the goals sought to be advanced ..., advancing them through a freewheeling nonelected judiciary is quite unacceptable in a democratic society.” Rehnquist, The Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 Tex. L. Rev. 693 , 699 (1976).  Compare Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U. S. 579, 605 (1976) (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment), with id., at 614 (StbwaRT, J., dissenting).
