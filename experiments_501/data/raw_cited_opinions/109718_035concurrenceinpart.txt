<author id="b166-4">Mr. Justice Stevens,</author>
<p id="ASn">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p id="b166-5">My disagreement with the Court is extremely narrow. The Court has not sanctioned a restraint on discussion between inmates on the relative advantages or disadvantages of belonging to a prisoners’ union. The prohibition of inmate-to-inmate solicitation which the Court upholds is defined as “an invitation to collectively engage in a legitimately prohibited activity.” <em>Ante, </em>at 132. The Court has made it clear that mere membership in a union is not such an activity, <em>ante, </em>at 128-129. The language of appellants’ “no-solicitation regula<page-number citation-index="1" label="139">*139</page-number>tion” is, however, somewhat broader.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Therefore, instead of concluding that the entire regulation is valid, <em>ante, </em>at 136, I would hold it invalid to the extent that it exceeds the Court’s definition.</p>
<p id="b167-4">I join the portions of the Court’s opinion concerning the bulk mailing and union meeting claims.</p>
