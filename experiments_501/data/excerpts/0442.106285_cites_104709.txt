 At the trial no search warrant was produced by the prosecution, nor was the failure to produce one explained or accounted for.  At best, “There is, in the record, considerable doubt as to whether there ever was any warrant for the search of defendant’s home.” 170 Ohio St., at 430, 166 N. E. 2d, at 389.  The Ohio Supreme Court believed a “reasonable argument” could be made that the conviction should be reversed “because the 'methods’ employed to obtain the [evidence] .  .  .  were such as to 'offend “a sense of justice,” ’ ” but the court found determinative the fact that the evidence had not been taken “from defendant’s person by the use of brutal or offensive physical force against defendant.” 170 Ohio St., at 431, 166 N. E. 2d, at 389-390.  The State says that even if the’ search were made without authority, or otherwise unreasonably, it is not prevented from using the unconstitutionally seized evidence at trial, citing Wolf v. Colorado, <citedDecision>338 U. S. 25</citedDecision> (1949), in which this Court did indeed hold “that in a prosecution in a State court for a State crime the Fourteenth Amend *646 ment does not forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure.” At p. 33.  On this appeal, of which we have noted probable jurisdiction, 364 U. S. 868 , it is urged once again that we review that holding.  3 I.  Seventy-five years ago, in Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 630 (1886), considering the Fourth 4 and Fifth Amendments as running “almost into each other” 5 on the facts before it, this Court held that the doctrines of those Amendments “apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employés of the sanctity of a man’s home and the privacies of life. It is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, *647 that constitutes the essence of the offence; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private property .... Breaking into a house and opening boxes and drawers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man’s own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime or to forfeit his goods, is within the condemnation ... [of those Amendments].” The Court noted that “constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed.  .  .  .

 .  .  and the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon all entrusted under our Federal system with the enforcement of the laws.” At pp. 391-392.  *648 Specifically dealing with the use of the evidence unconstitutionally seized, the Court concluded: “If letters and private documents can thus be seized and held and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense, the protection of the Fourth Amendment declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value, and, so far as those thus placed are concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution.' The efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established by years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.” At p. 393.  Finally, the Court in that case clearly stated that use of the seized evidence involved “a denial of the constitutional rights of the accused.” At p. 398.  Thus, in the year 1914, in the Weeks case, this Court “for the first time” held that “in a federal prosecution the Fourth Amendment barred the use of evidence secured through an illegal search and seizure.” <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado, supra, at 28</citedDecision> .  This Court has ever since required of federal law officers a strict adherence to that command which this Court has held to be a clear, specific, and constitutionally required — even if judicially implied — deterrent safeguard without insistence upon which the Fourth Amendment would have been reduced to “a form of words.” Holmes, J., Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385, 392 (1920).  It meant, quite simply, that “conviction by means of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions .  .  .  should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts .  .  .  ,” Weeks v. United States, supra, at 392, and that such evidence “shall not be used at all.” Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, at 392.  *649 There are in the cases of this Court some passing references to the Weeks rule as being one of evidence.  But the plain and unequivocal language of Weeks — and its later paraphrase in <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> — to the effect that the Weeks rule is of constitutional origin, remains entirely undisturbed.  In Byars v. United States, 273 U. S. 28 (1927), a unanimous Court declared that “the doctrine [cannot] ... be tolerated under our constitutional system, that evidences of crime discovered by a federal officer in making a search without lawful warrant may be used against the victim of the unlawful search where a timely challenge has been interposed.” At pp. 29-30 (emphasis added).  The Court, in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), in unmistakable language restated the Weeks rule: “The striking outcome of the Weeks case and those which followed it was the sweeping declaration that the Fourth Amendment, although not referring to or limiting the use of evidence in courts, really forbade its introduction if obtained by government officers through a violation of the Amendment.” At p. 462.  In McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943), we note this statement: “[A] conviction in the federal courts, the foundation of which is evidence obtained in disregard of liberties deemed fundamental by the Constitution, cannot stand.  Boyd v. United States .  .  .
**Lead Opinion**
 .” At pp. 339-340.  Significantly, in McNabb , the Court did then pass on to formulate a rule of evidence, saying, “[i]n the view we take of the case, however, it becomes unnecessary to reach the Constitutional issue [for] .  .  .  [t]he principles governing the admissibility of evidence in federal criminal trials have not been restricted ... to those derived solely from the Constitution.” At pp. 340-341.  II.  In 1949, 35 years after Weeks was announced, this Court, in <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado, supra,</citedDecision> again for the first time, 6 discussed the effect of the Fourth Amendment upon the States through the operation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  It said: “[W]e have no hesitation in saying that were a State affirmatively to sanction such police incursion into privacy it would run counter to the guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment.” At p. 28.  Nevertheless, after declaring that the “security of one’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police” is “implicit in 'the concept of ordered liberty’ and as such enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause,” cf. Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 (1937), and announcing that it “stoutly adhere [d]” to the Weeks decision, the Court decided that the Weeks exclusionary rule would not then be imposed upon the States as “an essential ingredient of the right.” <citedDecision>338 U. S., at 27-29</citedDecision> .  The Court’s reasons for not considering essential to the *651 right to privacy, as a curb imposed upon the States by the Due Process Clause, that which decades before had been posited as part and parcel of the Fourth Amendment’s limitation upon federal encroachment of individual privacy, were bottomed on factual considerations.  While they are not basically relevant to a decision that the exclusionary rule is an essential ingredient of the Fourth Amendment as the right it embodies is vouchsafed against the States by the Due Process Clause, we will consider the current validity of the factual grounds upon which <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> was based.  The Court in <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> first stated that “[t]he contrariety of views of the States” on the adoption of the exclusionary rule of Weeks was “particularly impressive” (at p. 29) ; and, in this connection, that it could not “brush aside the experience of States which deem the incidence of such conduct by the police too slight to call for a deterrent remedy ... by overriding the [States’] relevant rules of evidence.” At pp. 31-32.  While in 1949, prior to the <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> case, almost two-thirds of the States were opposed to the use of the exclusionary rule, now, despite the <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> case, more than half of those since passing upon it, by their own legislative or judicial decision, have wholly or partly adopted or adhered to the Weeks rule.  See Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 , Appendix, pp. 224-232 (1960).  Significantly, among those now following the rule is California, which, according to its highest court, was “compelled to reach tha(t conclusion because other remedies have completely failed to secure compliance with the constitutional provisions .  .  .  .” People v. Cohan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445 , 282 P. 2d 905, 911 (1955).  In connection with this California case, we note that the second basis elaborated in <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> in support of its failure to enforce the exclusionary doctrine against the States was that “other means of protection” have been afforded “the *652 right to privacy.” 7 <citedDecision>338 U. S., at 30</citedDecision> .  The experience of California that such other remedies have been worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other States.  The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been *653 recognized by this Court since <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> .  See Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 137 (1954).  Likewise, time has set its face against what <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> called the “weighty testimony” of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13 , 150 N. E. 585 (1926).  There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the Weeks exclusionary rule in New York, had said that “[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax.” 242 N. Y., at 22 , 150 N. E., at 588 .  However, the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court. These include the recent discarding of the “silver platter” doctrine which allowed federal judicial use.  of evidence seized in violation of the Constitution by state agents, Elkins v. United States, supra; the relaxation of the formerly strict requirements as to standing to challenge the use of evidence thus seized, so that now the procedure of exclusion, “ultimately referable to constitutional safeguards;” is available to anyone even “legitimately on [the] premises” unlawfully searched, Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, 266-267 (1960); and, finally, the formulation of a method to prevent state use of evidence unconstitutionally seized by federal agents, Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 (1956).  Because there can be no fixed formula, we are admittedly met with “recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches,” but less is not to be expected when dealing with a Constitution, and, at any rate, “ [r] easonableness is in the first instance for the [trial court] ... to determine.” United States v. Rabinowits, 339 U. S. 56, 63 (1950).  It, therefore, plainly appears that the factual considerations supporting the failure of the <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> Court to include the Weeks exclusionary rule when it recognized the enforceability of the right to privacy against the States in 1949, while not basically relevant to the constitutional consideration, could not, in any analysis, now be deemed controlling.  *654 III. Some five years after <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> , in answer to a plea made here Term after Term that we overturn its doctrine on applicability of the Weeks exclusionary rule, this Court indicated that such should not be done until the States had “adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the [Weeks] rule.” Irvine v. California, supra, at 134 .  There again it was said: “Never until June of 1949 did this Court hold the basic search-and-seizure prohibition in any way applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Ibid. And only last Term, after again carefully re-examining the <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> doctrine in Elkins v. United States, supra, the Court pointed out that “the controlling principles” as to search and seizure and the problem of admissibility “seemed clear” (at p. 212) until the announcement in <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> “that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not itself require state courts to adopt the exclusionary rule” of the Weeks case. At p. 213.  At the same time, the Court pointed out, “the underlying constitutional doctrine which <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> established .  .  .  that the Federal Constitution .  .  .  prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by state officers” had undermined the “foundation upon which the admissibility of state-seized evidence in a federal trial originally rested .  .  .  .” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> The Court concluded that it was therefore obliged to hold, although it chose the narrower ground on which to do so, that all evidence obtained by an unconstitutional search and seizure was inadmissible in a federal court regardless of.  its source.  Today we once again examine Wolf’s constitutional documentation of the right to privacy free from unreasonable state intrusion, and, after its dozen years on our books, are led by it to close the only *655 courtroom door remaining open to evidence secured by official lawlessness in flagrant abuse of that basic right, reserved to all persons as a specific guarantee against that very same unlawful conduct.  We hold that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, 'inadmissible in a state court. IV. Since the Fourth Amendment's right of privacy has been declared enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth, it is enforceable against them by the same sanction of exclusion as is used against the Federal Government.  Were it otherwise, then just as without the Weeks rule the assurance against unreasonable federal searches and seizures would be “a form of words,” valueless and undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of inestimable human liberties, so too, without that rule the freedom from state invasions of privacy would be so ephemeral and so neatly severed from its conceptual nexus with the freedom from all brutish means of coercing evidence as not to merit this Court’s high regard as a freedom “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” At the time that the Court held in <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> that the Amendment was applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause, the cases of this Court, as we have seen, had steadfastly held that as.  to federal officers the Fourth Amendment included the exclusion of the evidence seized in violation of its provisions.  Even <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> “stoutly adhered” to that proposition.  The right to privacy, when conceded operatively enforceable against the States, was not susceptible of destruction by avulsion of the sanction upon which its protection and enjoyment had always been deemed dependent under the Boyd, Weeks and Silverthorne cases. Therefore, in extending the substantive protections of due process to all constitutionally unreasonable searches — state or federal — it was *656 logically and constitutionally necessary that the exclusion doctrine — an essential part of the right to privacy — be also insisted upon as an essential ingredient of the right newly recognized by the <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> case. In short, the admission of the new constitutional right by <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> could not consistently tolerate denial of its most important constitutional privilege, namely, the exclusion of the evidence which an accused had been forced to give by reason of the unlawful seizure.  To hold otherwise is to grant the right but in reality to withhold its privilege and enjoyment.  Only last year the Court itself recognized that the purpose of the exclusionary rule “is to deter — to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way — by removing the incentive to disregard it.” Elkins v. United States, supra, at 217.  Indeed, we are aware of no restraint, similar to that rejected today, conditioning the enforcement of any other basic constitutional right.  The right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and particularly reserved to the people, would stand in marked contrast to all other rights declared as “basic to a free society.” <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado, supra, at 27</citedDecision> .  This Court has not hesitated to enforce as strictly against the States as it does against the Federal Government the rights of free speech and of a free press, the rights to notice and to a fair, public trial, including, as it does, the right not to be convicted by use of a coerced confession, however logically relevant it be, and without regard to its reliability.  Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534 (1961).  And nothing could be more certain than that when a coerced confession is involved, “the relevant rules of evidence” are overridden without regard to “the incidence of such conduct by the police,” slight or frequent.  Why should not the sanie rule apply to what is tantamount to coerced testimony by way of unconstitutional seizure of goods, papers, effects, documents, etc.?  We find that, *657 as to the Federal Government, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and, as to the States, the freedom from unconscionable invasions of privacy and the freedom from convictions based upon coerced confessions do enjoy an “intimate relation” 8 in their perpetuation of “principles of humanity and civil liberty [secured] .  .

Although appellant chose to urge what may have appeared to be the surer ground for favorable disposition and did not insist that <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> be overruled, the amicus curiae, who was also permitted to participate in the oral argument, did urge the Court to overrule <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> .  “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” The close connection between the concepts later embodied in these two Amendments had been noted at least as early as 1765 by Lord Camden, on whose opinion in Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howell’s State Trials 1029, the Boyd court drew heavily.  Lord Camden had noted, at 1073: “It is very certain, that the law obligeth no man to accuse himself; because the necessary means of compelling self-accusation, falling upon the innocent as well as the guilty, would be both cruel and unjust; and it should seem, that search for evidence is disallowed upon the same principle.  There too the innocent would be confounded with the guilty.” See, however, National Safe Deposit Co. v. Stead, 232 U. S. 58 (1914), and Adams v. New York, 192 U. S. 585 (1904).  Less than half of the States have any criminal provisions relating directly to unreasonable searches and seizures.  The punitive sanctions of the 23 States attempting to control such invasions of the right of privacy may be classified as follows: Criminal Liability of Affiant for Malicious Procurement of Search Warrant.  — Ala.

S. 101, 104 , and Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227, 236 , with Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 , and Wolf v. Colorado, <citedDecision>338 U. S. 25</citedDecision> .  As is always the case, however, state procedural requirements governing assertion and pursuance of direct and collateral constitutional challenges to criminal prosecutions must be respected.  We note, moreover, that the class of state convictions possibly affected by this decision is of relatively narrow compass when compared with Burns v. Ohio, 360 U. S. 252 , Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12 , and Herman v. Claudy, 350 U. S. 116 .  In those cases the same contention was urged and later proved unfounded.  In any case, further delay in reaching the present result could have no effect other than to compound the difficulties.  See the remarks of Mr. Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, September, 1952, pp. 1-2, quoted in Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 218-219, note 8 .  Cf. Marcus v. Search Warrant, post, p. 717.

 Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 ; Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 .  For, as stated in the former decision, “The effect of the Fourth Amendment is to put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints .  .  .  .” Id., 391-392.  It was therefore held that evidence obtained (which in that case was documents and correspondence) from a home without any warrant was not admissible in a federal prosecution.  We held in Wolf v. Colorado, <citedDecision>338 U. S. 25</citedDecision> , that the Fourth Amendment was applicable to the States by reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  But a majority held that the exclusionary rule of the Weeks case was not required of the States, that they could apply such sanctions as they chose.  That position had the necessary votes to carry the day. But with all respect it was not the voice of reason or principle.  *670 As stated in the Weeks case, if evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment can be used against an accused, “his right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value, and .  .  .  might as well be stricken from the Constitution.” 232 U. S., at 393 .  When we allowed States to give constitutional sanction to the “shabby business” of unlawful entry into a home (to use an expression of Mr. Justice Murphy, <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> , at 46), we did indeed rob the Fourth Amendment of much meaningful force.  There are, of course, other theoretical remedies.  One is disciplinary action within the hierarchy of the police system, including prosecution of the police officer for a crime.  Yet as Mr. Justice Murphy said in <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> , at 42, “Self-scrutiny is a lofty ideal, but its exaltation reaches new heights if we expect a District Attorney to prosecute himself or his associates for well-meaning violations of the search and seizure clause during a raid the District Attorney or his associates have ordered.” The only remaining remedy, if exclusion of the evidence is not required, is an action of trespass by the homeowner against the offending officer.  Mr. Justice Murphy showed how onerous and difficult it would be for the citizen to maintain that action and how meagre the relief even if the citizen prevails.  338 U. S. 42 -44.  The truth is that trespass actions against officers who make unlawful searches and seizures are mainly illusory remedies.  Without judicial action making the exclusionary rule applicable to the States, <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> in practical effect reduced the guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures to “a dead letter,” as Mr. Justice Rutledge said in his dissent.  See <citedDecision>338 U. S., at 47</citedDecision> .  <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado, supra,</citedDecision> was decided in 1949.  The immediate result was a storm of constitutional controversy which only today finds its end.  I believe that this is an appropriate case in which to put an end to the asymmetry which <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> imported into the law. See *671 Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 ; Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; Elkins v. United States, supra; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 .  It is an appropriate case because the facts it presents show — as would few other cases— the casual arrogance of those who have the untrammelled power to invade one’s home and to seize one’s person.  It is also an appropriate case in the narrower and more technical sense.  The issues of the illegality of the search and the admissibility of the evidence have been presented to the state court and were duly raised here in accordance with the applicable Rule of Practice.  4 The question was raised in the notice of appeal, the jurisdictional statement and in appellant’s brief on the merits.  5 It is true that argument was mostly directed to another issue in the case, but that is often the fact.  See Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 535-540 .  Of course, an earnest advocate of a position always believes that, had he only an additional opportunity for argument, his side would win. But, subject to the sound discretion of a court, all argument must at last come to a halt.  This is especially so as to an issue about which this Court said last year that “The arguments of its antagonists and of its proponents have been so many times marshalled as to require no lengthy elaboration here.” Elkins v. United States, supra, 216.  Moreover, continuance of <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> in its full vigor breeds the unseemly shopping around of the kind revealed in Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U. S. 381 .  Once evidence, inadmissible in a federal court, is admissible in *672 a state court a “double standard” exists which, as the Court points out, leads to “working arrangements” that undercut federal policy and reduce some aspects of law enforcement to shabby business.  The rule that supports that practice does not have the force of reason behind it.  Memorandum of Me. Justice Stewart.  Agreeing fully with Part I of Me. Justice Harlan’s dissenting opinion, I express no view as to the merits of the constitutional issue which the Court today decides.  I would, however, reverse the judgment in this case, because I am persuaded that the provision of § 2905.34 of the Ohio Revised Code, upon which the petitioner’s conviction was based, is, in the words of Mr. Justice Harlan, not “consistent with the rights of free thought and expression assured against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment.” This “confidential source” told the police, in the same breath, that “there was a large amount of policy paraphernalia being hidden in the home.” The purported warrant has disappeared from the case. The State made no attempt to prove its existence, issuance or contents, either at the trial or on the hearing of a preliminary motion to suppress.  The Supreme Court of Ohio said: “There is, in the record, considerable doubt as to whether there ever was any warrant for the search of defendant’s home.

It was therefore held that evidence obtained (which in that case was documents and correspondence) from a home without any warrant was not admissible in a federal prosecution.  We held in Wolf v.

That position had the necessary votes to carry the day. But with all respect it was not the voice of reason or principle.  *670 As stated in the Weeks case, if evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment can be used against an accused, “his right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value, and .  .  .  might as well be stricken from the Constitution.” 232 U. S., at 393 .  When we allowed States to give constitutional sanction to the “shabby business” of unlawful entry into a home (to use an expression of Mr. Justice Murphy, <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> , at 46), we did indeed rob the Fourth Amendment of much meaningful force.  There are, of course, other theoretical remedies.  One is disciplinary action within the hierarchy of the police system, including prosecution of the police officer for a crime.  Yet as Mr. Justice Murphy said in <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> , at 42, “Self-scrutiny is a lofty ideal, but its exaltation reaches new heights if we expect a District Attorney to prosecute himself or his associates for well-meaning violations of the search and seizure clause during a raid the District Attorney or his associates have ordered.” The only remaining remedy, if exclusion of the evidence is not required, is an action of trespass by the homeowner against the offending officer.  Mr. Justice Murphy showed how onerous and difficult it would be for the citizen to maintain that action and how meagre the relief even if the citizen prevails.  338 U. S. 42 -44.  The truth is that trespass actions against officers who make unlawful searches and seizures are mainly illusory remedies.  Without judicial action making the exclusionary rule applicable to the States, <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> in practical effect reduced the guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures to “a dead letter,” as Mr. Justice Rutledge said in his dissent.  See <citedDecision>338 U. S., at 47</citedDecision> .  <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado, supra,</citedDecision> was decided in 1949.  The immediate result was a storm of constitutional controversy which only today finds its end.  I believe that this is an appropriate case in which to put an end to the asymmetry which <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> imported into the law. See *671 Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 ; Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; Elkins v. United States, supra; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 .  It is an appropriate case because the facts it presents show — as would few other cases— the casual arrogance of those who have the untrammelled power to invade one’s home and to seize one’s person.  It is also an appropriate case in the narrower and more technical sense.  The issues of the illegality of the search and the admissibility of the evidence have been presented to the state court and were duly raised here in accordance with the applicable Rule of Practice.  4 The question was raised in the notice of appeal, the jurisdictional statement and in appellant’s brief on the merits.  5 It is true that argument was mostly directed to another issue in the case, but that is often the fact.  See Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 535-540 .  Of course, an earnest advocate of a position always believes that, had he only an additional opportunity for argument, his side would win. But, subject to the sound discretion of a court, all argument must at last come to a halt.  This is especially so as to an issue about which this Court said last year that “The arguments of its antagonists and of its proponents have been so many times marshalled as to require no lengthy elaboration here.” Elkins v. United States, supra, 216.  Moreover, continuance of <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> in its full vigor breeds the unseemly shopping around of the kind revealed in Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U. S. 381 .  Once evidence, inadmissible in a federal court, is admissible in *672 a state court a “double standard” exists which, as the Court points out, leads to “working arrangements” that undercut federal policy and reduce some aspects of law enforcement to shabby business.  The rule that supports that practice does not have the force of reason behind it.  Memorandum of Me. Justice Stewart.  Agreeing fully with Part I of Me. Justice Harlan’s dissenting opinion, I express no view as to the merits of the constitutional issue which the Court today decides.  I would, however, reverse the judgment in this case, because I am persuaded that the provision of § 2905.34 of the Ohio Revised Code, upon which the petitioner’s conviction was based, is, in the words of Mr. Justice Harlan, not “consistent with the rights of free thought and expression assured against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment.” This “confidential source” told the police, in the same breath, that “there was a large amount of policy paraphernalia being hidden in the home.” The purported warrant has disappeared from the case. The State made no attempt to prove its existence, issuance or contents, either at the trial or on the hearing of a preliminary motion to suppress.  The Supreme Court of Ohio said: “There is, in the record, considerable doubt as to whether there ever was any warrant for the search of defendant’s home.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 .  they obviously contravene the Federal and State constitutional provisions; by being convicted under the Statute involved herein, and in the manner in which she was convicted, Defendant-Appellant has been denied due process of law; a sentence of from one (1) to seven (7) years in a penal institution for alleged violation of this unconstitutional section of the Ohio Revised Code deprives the defendant of her right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness, contrary to the Federal and State constitutional provisions, for circumstances which she herself did not put in motion, and is a cruel and unusual punishment inflicted upon her contrary to the State and Federal Constitutions.” The appellant’s brief did not urge the overruling of Wolf.  Indeed it did not even cite the ease.  The brief of the appellee merely relied on Wolf in support of the State’s contention that appellant’s conviction was not vitiated by the admission in evidence of the fruits of the alleged unlawful search and seizure by the police.  The brief of the American and Ohio Civil Liberties Unions, as amici, did in one short concluding paragraph of its argument “request” the Court to re-examine and overrule Wolf, but without argumentation.  I quote in full this part of their brief: “This case presents the issue of whether evidence obtained in an illegal search and seizure can constitutionally be used in a State criminal proceeding.  We are aware of the view that this Court has taken on this issue in Wolf v. Colorado, <citedDecision>338 U. S. 25</citedDecision> .  It is our purpose by this paragraph to respectfully request that this Court re-examine this issue and conclude that the ordered liberty concept guaranteed to persons by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment necessarily requires that evidence illegally obtained in violation thereof, not be admissible in state criminal proceedings.” Counsel for appellant on oral argument, as in his brief, did not urge that <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> be overruled.  Indeed, when pressed by questioning from the bench whether he was not in fact urging us to overrule <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> , counsel expressly disavowed any such purpose.  “2905.37 Legitimate PublicatioNS Not Obscene.  “Sections 2905.33 to 2905.36, inclusive, of the Revised Code do not affect teaching in regularly chartered medical colleges, the publication of standard medical books, or regular practitioners of medicine or druggists in their legitimate business, nor do they affect the publication and distribution of bona fide works of art. No articles specified in sections 2905.33, 2905.34, and 2905.36 of the Revised Code shall be considered a work of art unless such article is made, published, and distributed by a bona fide association of artists or an association for the advancement of art whose demonstrated purpose does not contravene sections 2905.06 to 2905.44, inclusive, of the Revised Code, and which is not organized for profit.” § 3767.01 (C) “This section and sections 2905.34, .  .  .  2905.37 ... of the Revised Code shall not affect .  .  .  any newspaper, magazine, or other publication entered as second class matter by the post-office department.” The Ohio Supreme Court, in its construction of § 2905.34, controlling upon us here, refused to import into it any other exceptions than those expressly provided by the statute.  See note 7, supra. Instead it held that “If anyone looks at a book and finds it lewd, he is forthwith, under this legislation, guilty .  .  .  .” See <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. Colorado, <citedDecision>338 U. S., at 39-40</citedDecision> ; Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 133-134 , and at 138-139.  In the latter case, decided in 1954, Mr. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority, said (at p. 134): “We think that the <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> decision should not be overruled, for the reasons so persuasively stated therein.” Compare Schwartz v. Texas, 344 U. S. 199 , and Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 , in which the <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> case was discussed and in no way disapproved.  And see Pugach v. Dollinger, 365 U. S. 458 , which relied on Schwartz .  Actually, only four members of the majority support this reasoning.  See pp. 685-686, infra.  Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 ; Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253 .  My Brother Stewart concurs in the Court’s judgment on grounds which have nothing to do with <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> .
