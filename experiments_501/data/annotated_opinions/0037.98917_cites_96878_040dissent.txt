**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting.  I suppose that a patentee has no less property in his patented machine than any other owner, and that in addition to keeping the machine to himself the patent gives him the further right to forbid the rest of the world from making others like it.  In short, for whatever motive, he may keep his device wholly out of use.  Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., <citedDecision>210 U. S. 405, 422</citedDecision> .  So much being undisputed, I cannot understand why he may not keep it out of use unless the licensee, or, for the matter of that, the buyer, will use some unpatented thing in connection with it.  Generally speaking the measure of a condition is the consequence of a breach, and if that consequence is one that the owner may impose unconditionally, he may impose it conditionally upon a certain event.  Ashley v. Ryan, 153 U. S. 436, 443 .  Lloyd v. Dollison, 194 U. S. 445, 449 .  Non debet, cui plus licet, quod minus est non licere.  D. 50, 17, 21.
