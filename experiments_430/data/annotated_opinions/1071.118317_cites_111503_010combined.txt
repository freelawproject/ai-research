 We turn next to the question whether Florida's sovereign immunity, though not abrogated, was voluntarily waived.  IV We have long recognized that a State's sovereign immunity is "a personal privilege which it may waive at pleasure." Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S., at 447 .  The decision to waive that immunity, however, "is altogether voluntary on the part of the sovereignty." Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858).  Accordingly, our "test for determining whether a State has waived its immunity from federal-court jurisdiction is a stringent one." Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 234, 241</citedDecision> (1985).  Generally, we will find a waiver either if the State voluntarily invokes our jurisdiction, *676 Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U. S. 273, 284 (1906), or else if the State makes a "clear declaration" that it intends to submit itself to our jurisdiction, Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 54 (1944).  See also Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S., at 99 (State's consent to suit must be "unequivocally expressed").  Thus, a State does not consent to suit in federal court merely by consenting to suit in the courts of its own creation.  Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436, 441-445 (1900).  Nor does it consent to suit in federal court merely by stating its intention to "sue and be sued," Florida Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Servs. v. Florida Nursing Home Assn., 450 U. S. 147, 149-150 (1981) (per curiam) , or even by authorizing suits against it "`in any court of competent jurisdiction,'" Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm'n, 327 U. S. 573, 577-579 (1946).  We have even held that a State may, absent any contractual commitment to the contrary, alter the conditions of its waiver and apply those changes to a pending suit.
**Combined Opinion**
 Since "state proprietary activities may be, and often are, burdened with the same restrictions imposed on private market participants," "[e]venhandedness suggests that, when acting as proprietors, States should similarly share existing freedoms from federal constraints, including the inherent limits of the [dormant] Commerce Clause." White, supra, at 207-208, n. 3 .  The "market participant" exception to judicially created dormant Commerce Clause restrictions makes sense because the evil addressed by those restrictionsthe prospect that States will use custom duties, exclusionary trade regulations, and other exercises of governmental power (as opposed to the expenditure of state resources) to favor their own citizens, see Hughes, supra, at 808is entirely absent where the States are buying and selling in the market.  In contrast, a suit by an individual against an unconsenting State is the very evil at which the Eleventh Amendment is directedand it exists whether or not the State is acting for profit, in a traditionally "private" enterprise, and as a "market participant." In the sovereign-immunity context, moreover, "[e]venhandness" between individuals and States is not to be expected: "[T]he constitutional role of the States sets them apart from other *686 employers and defendants." Welch, 483 U. S., at 477 .  Cf. Atascadero, <citedDecision>473 U. S., at 246</citedDecision> .  [4] The United States points to two other contexts in which it asserts we have permitted Congress, in the exercise of its Article I powers, to extract "constructive waivers" of state sovereign immunity.  In Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275 (1959), we held that a bistate commission which had been created pursuant to an interstate compact (and which we assumed partook of state sovereign immunity) had consented to suit by reason of a suability provision attached to the congressional approval of the compact.  And we have held in such cases as South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203 (1987), that Congress may, in the exercise of its spending power, condition its grant of funds to the States upon their taking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take, and that acceptance of the funds entails an agreement to the actions.  These cases seem to us fundamentally different from the present one.  Under the Compact Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, § 10, cl. 3, States cannot form an interstate compact without first obtaining the express consent of Congress; the granting of such consent is a gratuity.  So also, Congress has no obligation to use its Spending Clause power to disburse funds to the States; such *687 funds are gifts.

 Post, at 697.  Perhaps so, which is why, in cases involving conditions attached to federal funding, we have acknowledged that "the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which `pressure turns into compulsion.'" Dole, supra, at 211 , quoting Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548, 590 (1937).  In any event, we think where the constitutionally guaranteed protection of the States' sovereign immunity is involved, the point of coercion is automatically passedand the voluntariness of waiver destroyedwhen what is attached to the refusal to waive is the exclusion of the State from otherwise lawful activity.  V The principal thrust of Justice Breyer's dissent is an attack upon the very legitimacy of state sovereign immunity itself.  In this regard, Justice Breyer and the other dissenters proclaim that they are "not yet ready," post, at 699 (emphasis added), to adhere to the still-warm precedent of Seminole Tribe and to the 110-year-old decision in Hans that supports it.  [5] Accordingly, Justice Breyer reiterates *688 (but only in outline form, thankfully) the now-fashionable revisionist accounts of the Eleventh Amendment set forth in other opinions in a degree of repetitive detail that has despoiled our northern woods. Compare post, at 700-701, with <citedDecision>Atascadero, supra, at 258-302</citedDecision> (Brennan, J., dissenting); Welch, supra, at 504-516 (Brennan, J., dissenting); Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 76-99 (Stevens, J., dissenting); id., at 100-185 (Souter, J., dissenting).  But see Alden v. Maine, post, at 760-808 (Souter, J., dissenting).  The arguments recited in these sources have been soundly refuted, and the position for which they have been marshaled has been rejected by constitutional tradition and precedent as clear and conclusive, and almost as venerable, as that which consigns debate over whether Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), was wrongly decided to forums more otherworldly than ours. See Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 33-34, 35-42 (Scalia, J., dissenting); Seminole Tribe, supra, at 54-73 ; Alden, post, at 712-730.  On this score, we think nothing further need be said except two minor observations peculiar to this case. *689 First, Justice Breyer and the other dissenters have adopted a decidedly perverse theory of stare decisis.  While finding themselves entirely unconstrained by a venerable precedent such as Hans , embedded within our legal system for over a century, see, e. g., Welch, 483 U. S., at 494, n. 27 ; Union Gas, supra, at 34-35 (Scalia, J., dissenting), at the same time they cling desperately to an anomalous and severely undermined decision (Parden) from the 1960's.  Surely this approach to stare decisis is exactly backwards unless, of course, one wishes to use it as a weapon rather than a guide, in which case any old approach will do.  Second, while we stress that the following observation has no bearing upon our resolution of this case, we find it puzzling that Justice Breyer would choose this occasion to criticize our sovereign-immunity jurisprudence as being ungrounded in constitutional text, since the present lawsuit that he would allow to go forwardhaving apparently been commenced against a State (Florida) by a citizen of another State (College Savings Bank of New Jersey), 948 F. Supp., at 401 -402 seems to fall foursquare within the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State .

 .  .  attached.'" 377 U. S., at 196 (quoting Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275, 281-282 (1959)).  Earlier case law had found a waiver of sovereign immunity in a State's decision to bring a creditor's claim in bankruptcy.  See Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565, 573-574 (1947).  Later case law, suggesting that a waiver may be found in a State's acceptance of a federal grant, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 234, 247</citedDecision> (1985), supports Parden 's conclusion.  Where is the sharp break?  The majority has only one answer to this question.  It believes that this Court's case law requires any "waiver" to be "express" and "unequivocal." Ante, at 680.  But the cases to which I have just referred show that is not so. The majority tries to explain some of those cases away with the statement that what is attached to the refusal to waive in those cases is "the denial of a gift or gratuity," while what is involved here is "the exclusion of the State from [an] otherwise lawful activity." Ante, at 687.

[1]  See Hardin, The Tragedy of the Commons, 162 Science 1243 (1968).  [2]  In response to this string of cases criticizing or narrowing the holding of Parden , Justice Breyer holds up three post- Parden cases as decisions that "support[ed]" Parden, post, at 696, or at least "carefully avoided calling [it] into question," post, at 698.  His perception of "support" in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 234</citedDecision> (1985), rests upon nothing more substantial than the fact that the case "suggest[ed] that a waiver may be found in a State's acceptance of a federal grant." Post, at 696.  But we make the same suggestion today, while utterly rejecting Parden .  As we explain elsewhere in detail, see infra, at 686-687, conditions attached to a State's receipt of federal funds are simply not analogous to Parden -style conditions attached to a State's decision to engage in otherwise lawful commercial activity.  Justice Breyer's second case, Welch , overruled Parden in part, as we discuss above, and we think it quite impossible to believe that the following statement in the opinion did not "questio[n] the holding of Parden that the Court today discards," post, at 698: "We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment." 483 U. S., at 475.  Calling what a prior case has flatly decided a "question" in need of "deciding," and (lest there be any doubt on the point) making it clear that we "intimat[e] no view" as to whether the answer given by that prior case was correct, surely was handwriting on the wall which even an inept cryptologist would recognize as spelling out the caption of today's opinion.
