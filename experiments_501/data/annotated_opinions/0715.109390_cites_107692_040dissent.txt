Mr. Justice Marshall, with whom Mr. Justice Brennan joins, dissenting.  The Court today holds that the First Amendment poses no bar to a shopping center owner’s prohibiting speech within his shopping center.  After deciding this far-reaching constitutional question, and overruling Food *526 Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 308</citedDecision> (1968), in the process, the Court proceeds to remand for consideration of the statutory question whether the shopping center owner in this case unlawfully interfered with the Butler Shoe Co. employees’ rights under § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. § 157 .  In explaining why it addresses any constitutional issue at all, the Court observes simply that the history of the litigation has been one of “shifting positions on the part of the litigants, the Board, and the Court of Appeals,” ante, at 512, as to whether relief was being sought, or granted, under the First Amendment, under § 7 of the Act, or under some combination of the two.  On my reading, the Court of Appeals’ decision and, even more clearly, the Board’s decision here for review, were based solely on § 7, not on the First Amendment; and this Court ought initially consider the statutory question without reference to the First Amendment — the question on which the Court remands.  But even under the Court’s reading of the opinions of the Board and the Court of Appeals, the statutory question on which it remands is now before the Court. By bypassing that question and reaching out to overrule a constitutionally based decision, the Court surely departs from traditional modes of adjudication.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on purely statutory grounds.  And on the merits of the only question that the Court decides, I dissent from the overruling of Logan Valley.  I The Court views the history of this litigation as one of “shifting positions” and “considerable confusion.” To be sure, the Board’s position has not been constant.

 Ill Turning to the constitutional issue resolved by the Court, I cannot escape the feeling that Logan Valley has been laid to rest without ever having been accorded a proper burial.  The Court today announces that “the ultimate holding in Lloyd amounted to a total rejection *535 of the holding in Logan Valley.” Ante, at 518.  To be sure, some Members of the Court, myself included, believed that Logan Valley called for a different result in Lloyd and alluded in dissent to the possibility that “it is Logan Valley itself that the Court finds bothersome.” 407 U. S., at 570, 584 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  But the fact remains that Logan Valley explicitly reserved the question later decided in Lloyd, and Lloyd carefully preserved the holding of Logan Valley.  And upon reflection, I am of the view that the two decisions are reconcilable.  A In Logan Valley the Court was faced with union picketing against a nonunion supermarket located in a large shopping center.  Our holding was a limited one: “All we decide here is that because the shopping center serves as the community business block 'and is freely accessible and open to the people in the area and those passing through,' Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U. S., at 508, the State may not delegate the power, through the use of its trespass laws, wholly to exclude those members of the public wishing to exercise their First Amendment rights on the premises in a manner and for a purpose generally consonant with the use to which the property is actually put.” <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 319-320</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  We carefully noted that we were “not called upon to consider whether respondents’ property rights could, consistently with the First Amendment, justify a bar on picketing which was not .  .  .  directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put.” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 320 n. 9.  Lloyd involved the distribution of antiwar handbills in a large shopping center, and while some of us viewed *536 the case differently, 407 U. S., at 570, 577-579 (Marshall, J., dissenting), the Court treated it as presenting the question left open in Logan Valley.  But the Court did no more than decide that question.  It preserved the holding of Logan Valley, as limited to cases in which (1) the picketing is directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property is put, and (2) “no other reasonable opportunities for the pickets to convey their message to their intended audience [are] available.” 407 U. S., at 563.  The Court today gives short shrift to the language in Lloyd preserving Logan Valley, and quotes extensively from language that admittedly differs in emphasis from much of the language of Logan Valley.  But even the language quoted by the Court says no more than that the dedication of the Lloyd Center to public use was more limited than the dedication of the company town in Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U. S. 501 (1946), and that the pickets in Lloyd were not entitled to exercise.  “the asserted First Amendment rights” — that is, the right to distribute antiwar handbills.

 *538 B It is inescapable that after Lloyd, Logan Valley remained “good law,” binding on the state and federal courts.  Our institutional duty in this case, if we consider the constitutional question at all, is to examine whether Lloyd and Logan Valley can continue to stand side by side, and, if they cannot, to decide which one must fall.  I continue to believe that the First Amendment principles underlying Logan Valley are sound, and were unduly limited in Lloyd.  But accepting Lloyd, I am not convinced that Logan Valley must be overruled.  The foundation of Logan Valley consisted of this Court’s decisions recognizing a right of access to streets, sidewalks, parks, and other public places historically associated with the exercise of First Amendment rights.  E. g., Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496, 515-516 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 308 (1940); Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569, 574 (1941); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413 (1943); Saia v. New York, 334 U. S. 558 (1948).  Thus, the Court in Logan Valley observed that access to such forums “cannot constitutionally be denied broadly and absolutely.” <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 315</citedDecision> .  The importance of access to such places for speech-related purposes is clear, for they are often the only places for effective speech and assembly.  Marsh v. Alabama, supra, which the Court purports to leave untouched, made clear that in applying those cases granting a right of access to streets, sidewalks, and other public places, courts ought not let the formalities of title put an end to analysis.  The Court in Marsh observed that “the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the *539 property belongs to a private corporation.” 326 U. S., at 503 .  That distinction was not determinative: “Ownership does not always mean absolute dominion.  The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.” Id., at 506 .  Regardless of who owned or possessed the town in Marsh , the Court noted, “the public .

 Indeed, the Court of Appeals quite clearly viewed the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation and the Board’s decision as statutorily based.  And the court did not even make the factual finding of functional equivalence to a business district that it recognized as a prerequisite to the application of the First Amendment.  501 F. 2d, at 164 .  It is irrelevant, in my view, that the property in this case was owned by the shopping center owner rather than by the employer.  The nature of the property interest is the same in either case. The only alternative means of communication referred to in Babcock & Wilcox were “personal contacts on streets or at home, telephones, letters or advertised meetings to get in touch with the employees.” 351 U. S., at 111 .  No point would be served by adding to the observations in Logan Valley and my dissent in Lloyd with respect to the growth of suburban shopping centers and the proliferation of activities taking place in such centers.
