 The United States was unable, however, to prevent state interference with the Creeks and the Seminóles in their domains east of the Mississippi, and accordingly proposed removal west of the Mississippi, guaranteeing that there no State or Territory should “ever have a right to pass laws for the government of such Indians, but they shall be allowed to govern themselves, so far as may be compatible with the general jurisdiction which Congress may think proper to exercise over them.” Article XIV, Treaty of March 24, 1832 ( 7 Stat. 366 ).  Long after the removal this guarantee was reaffirmed.  Article IV, Treaty of August 7, 1856 ( 11 Stat. 699 ).  Nothing in the subsequent *617 treaties and allotment acts relating specifically to the Creeks and the Seminóles was inconsistent with this guarantee of freedom from state control.  7 And Congress was careful to provide that nothing in the creation of the State of Oklahoma should qualify this promise.  Thus the Oklahoma Enabling Act ( 34 Stat. 267 ) provided that the Oklahoma Constitution should not “limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.” The constitution adopted by the people of Oklahoma renounced any claims to Indian lands (Art. 1, § 3), and exempted from taxation “such property as may be exempt by reason of treaty stipulations, existing between the Indians and the United States Government, or by Federal laws, during the force and effect of such treaties or Federal laws” (Art. X, § 6).  See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 309 ; Ex parte Webb, 226 U. S. 663 , 682-83; Ward v. Love County, 253 U. S. 17 ; Carpenter v. Shaw, <citedDecision>280 U. S. 363, 366</citedDecision> .  As we recently said in Board of Commissioners v. Seber, supra, Congress in 1887 turned from a policy of protecting Indian tribes in the possession of their domains to a program, now discontinued, of assimilating the Indians through dissolution of their tribal governments and the compulsory individualization of their lands.  This allotment program evolved out of the historical background sketched above, and took its cue from the previous protection and freedom from state control accorded Indians and their lands.  The Indian surrendered tribal land, pro *618 tected against state taxation as well as against all other forms of voluntary and involuntary encumbrance and alienation.  Cf. The Kansas Indians, supra; The New York Indians, supra. Under the various allotment acts he received in return land which was intended to have the same measure of protection for a temporary period, generally subject to extension.  Thus the General Allotment Act of 1887 ( 24 Stat. 388 ) provided for the issuance to allottees of trust patents which were to declare: “the United States does .  .

 Congress has regarded their members of the half Indian blood or more, whether enrolled or not, as restricted tribal Indians subject to federal control.  The fact that these Indians are citizens is not inconsistent with their restricted status or the exercise of federal supervision over them.  See Board of Commissioners v. deber, supra; Glenn v. Lewis, 105 F. 2d 398 .  See Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567 ; Act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861 ; Act of June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 500 ; § 19 of Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; § 4 of Act of May 10,1928, 45 Stat. 495 and 733.  The fact that the exemptions do not mention inheritance or estate taxes is unimportant.  As pointed out before, contrary to the general rule Indian tax exemptions are to be liberally construed.  See Carpenter v. Shaw, <citedDecision>280 U. S. 363, 366-67</citedDecision> .  For that reason decisions, such as U. S. Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U. S. 57 , that statutory exemptions from taxation do not include an exemption from estate taxes, have no application here.  In addition to the statutes cited in Note 2, supra, see also Act of May 27,1908, 35 Stat. 312 ; and Act of January 27, 1933, 47 Stat. 777 .  See Note 12, infra.  See Note 12, infra.  Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts of July 22, 1790, 1 Stat. 137 ; March 1,1793, 1 Stat. 329 ; March 3,1799, § 12, 1 Stat. 743,25 U. S. C. §177.
