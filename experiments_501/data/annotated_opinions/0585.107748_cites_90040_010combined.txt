 The coverage of § 1982, however, is markedly different from that of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.  [22]  82 U. S. App. D. C. 180, 162 F. 2d 233 .  [23] 332 U. S. 789 .  [24]  Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 , invalidating a New Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community, or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, "except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected." See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 12 .  [25]  Two of this Court's early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action.  Virginia v. Rives, <citedDecision>100 U. S. 313, 317-318</citedDecision> ; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17.  But all that Virginia v. <citedDecision>Rives, supra</citedDecision> , actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322.  See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 797-804 .  And of course the Civil Rights Cases, supra , which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 335 , did not involve the present statute at all. It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31 , characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , as having "held" that "[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute .  .  .  [are] directed is governmental action." 334 U. S., at 31.

W. Brock, supra, n. 36, at 115.  [71]  Section 18 of the Enforcement Act of 1870, Act of May 31, 1870, c. 114, § 18, 16 Stat. 144 : " And be it further enacted, That the act to protect all persons in the United States in their civil rights, and furnish the means of their vindication, passed April nine, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, is hereby re-enacted .  .  .  ." [72]  See United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383, 387-388 ; United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 804-805 ; 2 W. Fleming, Documentary History of Reconstruction 285-288 (1907); K. Stampp, supra, n. 34, at 145, 171, 185, 198-204; G. Stephenson, Race Distinctions in American Law 116 (1910).  [73]  The Court of Appeals in this case seems to have derived such an assumption from language in Virginia v. Rives, <citedDecision>100 U. S. 313, 317-318</citedDecision> , and Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31 .  See 379 F. 2d 33 , 39-40, 43.  Both of those opinions simply asserted that, at least after its re-enactment in 1870, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was directed only at governmental action.  Neither opinion explained why that was thought to be so, and in each case the statement was merely dictum.  See n. 25, supra. [74]  So it was, for example, that this Court unanimously upheld the power of Congress under the Thirteenth Amendment to make it a crime for one individual to compel another to work in order to discharge a debt.  Clyatt v. United States, 197 U. S. 207 .  [75]  See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 113, 318, 476, 499, 507, 576, 600-601.

 Certainly, then, it was "customary." To suggest, however, that there might be room for argument in this case ( post, at 475, n. 65) that the discrimination against petitioners was not in some measure a part and product of this longstanding and widespread customary pattern is to pervert the problem by allowing the legal mind to draw lines and make distinctions that have no place in the jurisprudence of a nation striving to rejoin the human race.  [1]  This "state action" argument emphasizes the respondents' role as housing developers exercising continuing authority over a suburban housing complex with about 1,000 inhabitants.  [2]  The Civil Rights Act of 1968, Pub. L. 90-284, 82 Stat. 73.  [3] Id., §§ 801-819.  [4]  See ante, at 417, n. 21.  [5]  See also Virginia v. Rives, <citedDecision>100 U. S. 313, 317-318</citedDecision> .  [6]  Section 1978 of the Revised Statutes.  [7]  See also Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 78-79 .  [8]  It seems to me that this passage is not dictum, as the Court terms it, ante, at 419 and n. 25, but a holding.  For if the Court had held the covenants in question invalid as between the parties, then it would not have had to rely upon a finding of "state action." [9]  Despite the Court's view that this reading flies in the face of the "plain and unambiguous terms" of the statute, see ante, at 420, it is not without precedent.  In the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , the Court said of identical language in the predecessor statute to § 1982: "[C]ivil rights, such as are guaranteed by the Constitution against State aggression, cannot be impaired by the wrongful acts of individuals, unsupported by State authority .
