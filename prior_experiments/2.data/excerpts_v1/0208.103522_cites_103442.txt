**Combined Opinion**
Cf. Mulford v. Smith, 307 U.S. 38 ; Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1 . The power of Congress under the commerce clause to authorize the fixing of minimum prices for milk was upheld in United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, 307 U.S. 533 , decided in 1939. The next year the price-fixing provisions of the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937 were sustained. Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381 . And at this term we upheld the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100 . These cases represent more than scattered examples of constitutionally permissible price-fixing schemes. They represent in large measure a basic departure from the philosophy and approach of the majority in the Ribnik case. The standard there employed, following that used in Tyson & Brother v. Banton, 273 U.S. 418 , 430 et seq., was that the constitutional validity of price-fixing legislation, at least in absence of a so-called emergency, [6] was dependent on whether or not the business in question was "affected with a public interest." Cf. Brazee v. Michigan, 241 U.S. 340 . It was said to be so affected if it had been "devoted to the public use" and if "an interest in effect" had been granted "to the public in that use."
