**Combined Opinion**
 To accept appellants' apparent suggestion that the Commerce Clause prohibits the States from requiring an activity connected to interstate commerce to contribute to the general cost of providing governmental services, as distinct from those costs attributable to the taxed activity, would place such commerce in a privileged position.  But as we recently reiterated.  "[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases *624 the cost of doing business.'" Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U. S. 100, 108 (1975), quoting Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S., at 254 .  The "just share of state tax burden" includes sharing in the cost of providing "police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and `the advantages of a civilized society.'" Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980), quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 445 (1979).  See Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S., at 750-751 ; id., at 764 (POWELL, J., concurring in part and concurring in result); General Motors Corp. v. Washington, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 436, 440-441</citedDecision> (1964).  Furthermore, there can be no question that Montana may constitutionally raise general revenue by imposing a severance tax on coal mined in the State.  The entire value of the coal, before transportation, originates in the State, and mining of the coal depletes the resource base and wealth of the State, thereby diminishing a future source of taxes and economic activity.  [13] Cf. Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 758-759 .  In many respects, a severance tax is like a real property tax, which has never been doubted as a legitimate means of raising revenue by the situs State (quite apart from the right of that or any other State to tax income derived from use of the property).  See, e. g., Old Dominion S.S. Co. v. Virginia, 198 U. S. 299 (1905); Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Missouri ex rel. Gottlieb, 190 U. S. 412 (1903); Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, 155 U. S. 688 (1895).  When, as here, a general revenue tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce and is apportioned to activities occurring within *625 the State, the State "is free to pursue its own fiscal policies, unembarrassed by the Constitution, if by the practical operation of a tax the state has exerted its power in relation to opportunities which it has given, to protection which it has afforded, to benefits which it has conferred by the fact of being an orderly, civilized society."

 See National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551 (1977); Standard Pressed Steel Co. v. Washington Revenue Dept., 419 U. S. 560 (1975).  As the Court explained in Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., supra, at 446 (emphasis added), "the incidence of the tax as well as its measure [must be] tied to the earnings which the State .  .  .  has made possible, insofar as government is the prerequisite for the fruits of civilization for which, as Mr. Justice Holmes was fond of saying, we pay taxes." Against this background, we have little difficulty concluding that the Montana tax satisfies the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test.  The "operating incidence" of the tax, see General Motors Corp. v. Washington, <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 440-441</citedDecision> , is on the mining of coal within Montana.  Because it is measured as a percentage of the value of the coal taken, the Montana tax is in "proper proportion" to appellants' activities within the State and, therefore, to their "consequent enjoyment of the opportunities and protections which the State has afforded" in connection with those activities.  <citedDecision>Id., at 441</citedDecision> .  Cf. Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S., at 427 .  *627 When a tax is assessed in proportion to a taxpayer's activities or presence in a State, the taxpayer is shouldering its fair share of supporting the State's provision of "police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and `the advantages of a civilized society.'" Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S., at 228, quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S., at 445 .  Appellants argue, however, that the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test must be construed as requiring a factual inquiry into the relationship between the revenues generated by a tax and costs incurred on account of the taxed activity, in order to provide a mechanism for judicial disapproval under the Commerce Clause of state taxes that are excessive.  This assertion reveals that appellants labor under a misconception about a court's role in cases such as this.  [16] The simple fact is that the appropriate level or rate of taxation is essentially a matter for legislative, and not judicial, resolution.

 Even the trial court in the present case recognized that if it reached this question it "would necessarily have to deny the motion to dismiss and proceed to a factual determination." App. 37a.  [11]  As the example of Alaska illustrates, this prospect is not a fanciful one.  Ninety percent of Alaska's revenue derives from petroleum taxes and royalties; because of the massive sums that have been so raised, that State's income tax has been eliminated.  See N. Y. Times, June 5, 1981, section 1, p. A10, col. 1.  As noted above, Montana's severance tax already allegedly accounts for 20% of its total tax revenue, and the State has enacted property and income tax relief.  [12]  The Court apparently derives its interpretation of the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test primarily from Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435 (1940), and General Motors Corp. v. Washington, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 436</citedDecision> (1964).  Ante, at 624-626.  In neither of those cases, however, did the Court consider the question presented here.  J. C. Penney involved a Fourteenth Amendment challenge brought by a foreign corporation to a Wisconsin tax imposed on domestic and foreign corporations "for the privilege of declaring .  .  .  dividends" out of income from property located and business transacted in Wisconsin.  The corporation argued that because the income from the Wisconsin transactions had been transferred to New York, Wisconsin had "no jurisdiction to tax" those amounts.  311 U. S., at 436 .  The Court rejected that argument, holding that "[t]he fact that a tax is contingent upon events brought to pass without a state does not destroy the nexus between such a tax and transactions within a state for which the tax is an exaction." Id., at 445 .  In General Motors, the question before the Court was the validity of an unapportioned tax on the gross receipts of a corporation in interstate commerce.  The Court concluded that there was a sufficient nexus to uphold the tax. <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 448</citedDecision> .  See <citedDecision>id., at 449-450</citedDecision> (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).  [13]  In Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., a telegraph company engaged in interstate commerce challenged both an annual license tax and an annual tax of $2 for each telegraph pole that the company maintained in the city of Richmond, Va. The Court sustained the validity of the license tax on the ground that it was simply a nondiscriminatory "exercise of the police power .  .  .  for revenue purposes." 249 U. S., at 257 .  In contrast, the pole tax was subjected to stricter scrutiny; the Court stated that while interstate commerce must pay its way, the authority remains in the courts, "on proper application, to determine whether, under the conditions prevailing in a given case, the charge made is reasonably proportionate to the service to be rendered and the liabilities involved, or whether it is a disguised attempt to impose a burden on interstate commerce."
