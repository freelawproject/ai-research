 See Furman v. Georgia, supra, at 461-462 (Powell, J., dissenting).  C In the discussion to this point we have sought to identify the principles and considerations that guide a court in addressing an Eighth Amendment claim.  We now consider specifically whether the sentence of death for the crime of murder is a per se violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.  We note first that history and precedent strongly support a negative answer to this question.  The imposition of the death penalty for the crime of murder has a long history of acceptance both in the United States and in England.  The common-law rule *177 imposed a mandatory death sentence on all convicted murderers.  McGautha v. California, <citedDecision>402 U. S. 183, 197-198</citedDecision> (1971).  And the penalty continued to be used into the 20th century by most American States, although the breadth of the common-law rule was diminished, initially by narrowing the class of murders to be punished by death and subsequently by widespread adoption of laws expressly granting juries the discretion to recommend mercy.  <citedDecision>Id., at 199-200</citedDecision> .  See Woodson v. North Carolina, post, at 289-292.  It is apparent from the text of the Constitution itself that the existence of capital punishment was accepted by the Framers.  At the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified, capital punishment was a common sanction in every State.  Indeed, the First Congress of the United States enacted legislation providing death as the penalty for specified crimes.  C. 9, 1 Stat. 112 (1790).  The Fifth Amendment, adopted at the same time as the Eighth, contemplated the continued existence of the capital sanction by imposing certain limits on the prosecution of capital cases: “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury .

 The Supreme Court of Georgia, in Arnold v. State, 236 Ga. 534, 540 , 224 S. E. 2d 386, 391 (1976), recently held unconstitutional the portion of the first circumstance encompassing persons who have a “substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions” because it did not set “sufficiently 'clear and objective standards.’” The statute requires that the Supreme Court of Georgia obtain and preserve the records of all capital felony cases in which the death penalty was imposed after January 1, 1970, or such earlier date that the court- considers appropriate.  § 27-2537 (f) (Supp. 1975).  To aid the court in its disposition of these cases the statute further provides for the appointment of a special assistant and authorizes the employment of additional staff members.  §§ 27-2537 (f)-(h) (Supp. 1975).  See Ga. Const., Art. 5, §1, ¶12, Ga. Code Ann. §2-3011 (1973); Ga. Code Ann. §§77-501 , 77-511, 77-513 (1973 and Supp. 1975) (Board of Pardons and Paroles is authorized to commute sentence of death except in eases where Governor refuses to suspend that sentence).  Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459, 464 (1947); In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890); Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 134-135 (1879).  See also McGautha v. California, <citedDecision>402 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1971); Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100 (1958) (plurality opinion).  408 U. S., at 375 (Burger, C. J., dissenting); id., at 405 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); id., at 414 (Powell, J., dissenting); id., at 465 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  Id., at 257 (Brennan, J., concurring); id., at 314 (Marshall, J., concurring).  Id., at 240 (Douglas, J., concurring); id., at 306 (Stewart, J., concurring); id., at 310 (White, J., concurring).  Since five Justices wrote separately in support of the judgments in Furman , the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds — Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice White.  See n. 36, infra.  408 U. S., at 316-328 (Marshall, J., concurring).

 In United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570 (1968), the Court considered a statute that provided that if a defendant pleaded guilty, the maximum penalty would be life imprisonment, but if a defendant chose to go to trial, the maximum penalty upon conviction was death.  In holding that the statute was constitutionally invalid, the Court noted: “The inevitable effect of any such provision is, of course, to discourage assertion of the Fifth Amendment right not to plead guilty and to deter exercise of the Sixth Amendment right to demand a jury trial. If the provision had no other purpose or effect than to chill the assertion of constitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to exercise them, then it would be patently unconstitutional.” Id., at 581 .  But see Md. Const., Art-.  XV;§5: “In the trial of all criminal cases, the jury shall be the Judges of the Law, as well as of fact... See also Md. Code Ann., art. 27, § 593 (1971).  Maryland judges, however, typically give advisory instructions on the law to the jury.  See Md. Rule 756; Wilson v. State, 239 Md. 245 , 210 A. 2d 824 (1965).  See <citedDecision>McGautha</citedDecision> v. California, <citedDecision>402 U. S., at 204-207</citedDecision> ; Report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, 1949-1953, Cmd.  8932, ¶ 595.  The Model Penal Code proposes the following standards: “(3) Aggravating Circumstances.  “(a) The murder was committed by a convict under sentence of imprisonment.  *194 “(b) The defendant was previously convicted of another murder or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person.  “(c) At the time the murder was committed the defendant also committed another murder.  “(d) The defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons.

 “(c) The victim was a participant in the defendant’s homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act.  “(d) The murder was committed under circumstances which the defendant believed to provide a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.  “(e) The defendant was an accomplice in a murder committed by another person and his participation in the homicidal act was relatively minor.  “(f) The defendant acted under duress or under the domination of another person.  “ (g) At the time of the murder, the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or intoxication.  "(h) The youth of the defendant at the time of the crime.” ALI Model Penal Code §210.6 (Proposed Official Draft 1962).  As Mr. Justice Brennan noted in <citedDecision>McGautha</citedDecision> v. California, supra, at 285-286 (dissenting opinion): “[E]ven if a State’s notion of wise capital sentencing policy is such that the policy cannot be implemented through a formula capable of mechanical application .  .  .  there is no reason that it should not give some guidance to those called upon to render decision.” A system could have standards so vague that they would fail adequately to channel the sentencing decision patterns of juries with the result that a pattern of arbitrary and capricious sentencing like that found unconstitutional in Furman could occur.  In <citedDecision>McGautha</citedDecision> v. California, supra, this Court held that the *196 Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require that a jury be provided with standards to guide its decision whether to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment or death or that the capital-sentencing proceeding be separated from the guilt-determination process.  <citedDecision>McGautha</citedDecision> was not an Eighth Amendment decision, and to the extent it purported to deal with Eighth Amendment concerns, it must be read in light of the opinions in Furman v. Georgia.  There the Court ruled that death sentences imposed under statutes that left juries with untrammeled discretion to impose or withhold the death penalty violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  While Furman did not overrule Mc-Gautha, it is clearly in substantial tension with a broad reading of McGautha’s holding.  In view of Furman, McGautha can be viewed rationally as a precedent only for the proposition that standardless jury sentencing procedures were not employed in the cases there before the Court so as to violate the Due Process Clause.  We note that McGautha!s assumption that it is not possible to devise standards to guide and regularize jury sentencing in capital cases has been undermined by subsequent experience.  In view of that experience and the considerations set forth in the text, we adhere to Furman’s determination that where the ultimate punishment of death is at issue ■ a system of standardless jury discretion violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The text of the statute enumerating the various aggravating circumstances is set out at n. 9, supra. See Moore v. State, 233 Ga. 861, 865 , 213 S. E. 2d 829, 832 (1975).
