 8 See Washington, D. C., Housing Regulations §2104.  9 This is the more prevalent enforcement procedure.  See Note, Enforcement of Municipal Housing Codes, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 801 , 813-816.  10 The San Francisco Code requires that the inspector display-proper credentials, that he inspect “at reasonable times,” and that *532 he not obtain entry by force, at least when there is no emergency.  The Baltimore ordinance in Frank required that the inspector “have cause to suspect that a nuisance exists.” Some cities notify residents in advance, by mail or posted notice, of impending area inspections.  State courts upholding these inspections without warrants have imposed a general reasonableness requirement.  See cases cited, n. 3, supra. 11 See Abbate Bros. v.
