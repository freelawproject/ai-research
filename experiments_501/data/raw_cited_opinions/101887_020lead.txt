<p id="ACC">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b373-5">The.New State Ice Company, engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling and distributing ice under a license or permit duly issued by the Corporation Commission of Oklahoma, brought this suit against Liebmann in the federal district court for the western district of Oklahoma to enjoin him from manufacturing, selling and distributing ice within Oklahoma City without first having obtained a like license or permit from the commission. The license or permit is required by an act of the Oklahoma legislature, c. 147, Session Laws, 1925. That act declares that the manufacture, sale and distribution of ice is a public business; that no one shall be permitted to manufacture, sell or distribute ice within the state without -first having secured a license for that purpose from the commission; that whoever shall engage in such business without obtaining the license shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by fine not to exceed $25, each day’s violation constituting a separate offense, and that by general order of the, commission, a fine not to exceed $500 may be imposed for each violation.</p>
<p id="b373-6">Section 3 of the act provides:</p>
<blockquote id="b373-7">“ That the Corporation Commission shall not issue license to any person, firm or corporation for the manufacture, sale and distribution of ice, or either of them, within this State, except upon a hearing had by said Commission at which said hearing, competent testimony and proof shall be presented showing the necessity for the manufacture, sale or distribution of ice, or either of them, <page-number citation-index="1" label="272">*272</page-number>at the point, community or place desired. If the facts proved at said hearing disclose that the facilities for the manufacture, sale and distribution of ice by some person, firm or corporation already licensed by said commission at said point, community or place, are sufficient to meet the public needs therein, the said Corporation Commission may refuse and deny the applicant [application] for said license. In addition to said authority, the said Commission shall have the right to take into consideration the responsibility, reliability, qualifications and capacity of the person, firm or corporation applying for said-license and of the person, firm or corporation already licensed in said place or community, as to afford all reasonable facilities, conveniences and services to the public and shall have the power and authority to require such facilities and services to be afforded the public; provided, that nothing herein shall operate to prevent the licensing of any person, firm or corporation now engaged in the manufacture, sale and distribution of ice, or either of them, in any town, city or community of -this State, whose license shall be granted and issued by said Commission upon application of such person, firm or corporation and payment of license fee.”</blockquote>
<p id="b374-5">The portion of the section immediately in question here is .that which forbids the commission to issue a license to any applicant except upon proof of the necessity for a supply of ice at the place where it is sought to establish the business, and which authorizes a denial' of the application where the existing licensed facilities “ are sufficient to meet the public needs therein.” The district court dismissed the bill of complaint for want of equity, on the ground that the manufacture and sale of ice is a private business which may not be subjected to the foregoing regulation. 42 F. (2d) 913. The court of appeals affirmed. 52 F. (2d) 349.</p>
<p id="b375-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="273">*273</page-number>. It must be conceded that all businesses are subject to some measure of public regulation. And that the business of manufacturing, selling or distributing ice, like that of the grocer, the dairyman, the butcher or the baker may be subjected to appropriate regulations in the interest of the public health cannot be doubted; but the question here is whether the business is so charged with a public use as to justify the particular restriction above stated. If this legislative restriction be within the constitutional power of the state legislature, it follows that the license or permit, issued to appellant, constitutes a franchise, to which a court of equity will afford protection against one who seeks to carry on the same business without obtaining from the commission a license or permit to do so. <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Corporation Commission, </em>278 U. S. 515, 519-521. In that view, engagement in the business is a privilege to be exercised only in virtue of ,a public grant, and not a common right to be exercised independently <em>(id.) </em>by any competent person conformably to reasonable regulations equally applicable to all who choose to engage therein.</p>
<p id="A28">The <em>Frost </em>case is relied on here. That case dealt' with the business of operating a cotton gin. It was conceded that this was ,a business clothed with a public interest, and that the statute requiring a showing of public necessity as a condition precedent to the issue of a permit was valid. But the conditions which warranted the concession there are wholly wanting here. It long has been recognized that mills for the grinding of grain or performing similar services for all comers ,are devoted to a public use and subject to public control, whether they be operated by direct authority of the state or entirely upon individual initiative. At a very early period a majority of the states had adopted general acts authorizing the taking and flowage, <em>in invitum, </em>of lands for their erection and maintenance. In passing these acts, the attention of'the legislatures no <page-number citation-index="1" label="274">*274</page-number>doubt was directed principally to grist mills; but some of the acts, either in precise terms or in their application, were extended to other kinds of mills. <em>Head </em>v. <em>Amoskeag Mfg. Co., </em>113 U. S. 9, 16-19; <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>86 Me. 102, 104-106; 29 Atl. 947. The mills were usually operated by the use of water power, but this method of operation has been said not to be essential. <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, supra, </em>at p. 106. It was open to the proprietor of a mill <em>to </em>maintain it as a private mill for grinding his own grain, and thus free from legislative control; but if the proprietor assumed to serve the general public he thereby dedicated his mill to the public use and subjected it to such législative control as was appropriate to that status. In such cases the mills were regarded as so necessary to the existence of the communities which they served as to justify the government in fostering and maintaining them, and imposing limitations upon their operation for the protection of the public. <em>Id.</em></p>
<p id="b376-4">In <em>Chickasha Cotton Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Cotton County Gin Co., </em>40 F. (2d) 846, three circuit judges passed upon the constitutionality of the Oklahoma cotton ginning act. Opinions were delivered <em>seriatim, </em>all to the effect, but for varying reasons, that the business of operating cotton gins in Oklahoma was clothed with a public interest. One of the judges thought that the rule in respect of grist mills should apply by analogy, on the ground of the similarity of service. The rule that mills whose services are open to all comers are clothed with a public interest was formulated in the light, and upon the basis, of historical usage, which had survived the limitations that otherwise might be imposed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the cotton gin has no such background of ancient usage, and, as the opinion by Judge Phillips points out, there is always danger of our being led afield by relying over-much upon analogies, the analogy here is not without helpful significance.</p>
<p id="b377-2"><page-number citation-index="1" label="275">*275</page-number>In that connection we also may consider <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>198 U. S. 361, and <em>Strickley </em>v. <em>Highland Boy Mining Co., </em>200 U. S. 527, which dealt with the cognate question of what is a public use in respect of which the right of eminent domain may be exercised. The cases involved a statute of the State of Utah, which declared:</p>
<blockquote id="b377-3"><em>“ </em>The cultivation and irrigation of the soil, the production and reduction of ores, are of vital necessity to the people of the State of Utah; are pursuits in which all are interested and from which all derive a benefit; and the use and application of the unappropriated waters of the natural streams and water courses of the State to the generation of electrical force or energy to be employed in industrial pursuits are of great public benefit and utility. So irrigation of land, the mining, milling, smelting or other reduction of ores, and such use and application of such waters for the generation of electrical power to be employed as aforesaid are hereby declared to be for the public use, and the right of eminent domain may be exercised in behalf thereof.” c. 95, §. 1, Laws of Utah, 1896.</blockquote>
<p id="b377-4">In the <em>Nash </em>case, this court, applying that statute, sustained the condemnation of a right of way across the lands of one private owner for a ditch to convey water for the purpose of irrigating the lands of another private owner. The decision was rested explicitly upon the existence of conditions peculiar to the state. These conditions are epitomized in the legislative declaration above quoted. The court said (pp. 369-370) that its decision was not to be understood as approving the broad proposition that private property might be taken in all cases where the taking might promote the public interest and tend to develop the natural resources of the state, but, having reference to the conditions there appearing, <em>“ </em>that the use is a public one, although the taking of' the right of way is for the purpose simply of thereby obtaining the water for an individual, where it is absolutely necessary to <page-number citation-index="1" label="276">*276</page-number>enable him to make any use whatever of his land, and which will be valuable and fertile only if water can be obtained.”</p>
<p id="b378-5">This was followed in the <em>Strickley </em>case, where, mining being one of the chief industries of the state and its development peculiarly important for the public welfare, the condemnation of a right of way for an aerial bucket line across private lands, for the purpose of transporting ores from a- mine in private ownership, was upheld under the same statute.</p>
<p id="b378-6">These cases, though not strictly analogous, furnish persuasive ground for upholding the declaration of the Oklahoma legislature in respect of the public nature of cotton gins in that state. The production of cotton is the chief industry of the State of Oklahoma, and is of such paramount importance as to justify the assertion that the general welfare and prosperity of the state in a very large and real sense depend upon its maintenance. Cotton ginning is a process which must take place before the cotton is in a condition for the market. The cotton gin bears the same relation to the cotton grower that the old grist mill did to the grower of wheat. The individual grower of the raw product is generally financially unable to set up a plant for himself; but the service is a necessary one with which, ordinarily, he cannot afford to dispense. He is compelled, therefore, to resort for- such service to the establishment which operates in his locality. So dependent, generally, is he upon the neighborhood cotton gin that he faces the practical danger of being placed at the mercy of the operator in respect of exorbitant charges and arbitrary control. The relation between the growers of cotton, who constitute a very large proportion of the population, and those engaged in furnishing the service, is thus seen to be a peculiarly close one in respect of an industry of vital concern <em>to </em>the general public. These considerations render it not unreasonable <page-number citation-index="1" label="277">*277</page-number>to conclude that the business “ has been devoted to a public use and its use thereby, in effect, granted to the public.” <em>Tyson &amp; Bro. </em>v. <em>Banton, </em>273 U. S. 418, 434; <em>Wolff Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Court, </em>262 U. S. 522, 535, 538; same case, 267 U. S. 552, 563, <em>et seq.</em></p>
<p id="b379-4">We have thus, with some particularity, discussed the circumstances which, so far as the State of Oklahoma is concerned, afford ground for sustaining the legislative pronouncement that the business of operating cotton gins is charged with a public use, in order to put them in contrast with the completely unlike circumstances which attend the business of manufacturing, selling and dis-. tributing ice. Here we áre dealing with an ordinary business, not with a paramount industry upon which the prosperity of the entire state in large measure depends. It is a business as essentially private in its nature as the business of the grocer, the dairyman, the butcher, the baker, the shoemaker, or the tailor, each of whom performs a service which, to a greater or less extent, the community is dependent upon and is interested in having maintained; but which bears no such relation to the public as to warrant its inclusion.in the category of businesses charged with a public use. It may be quite true that in Oklahoma ice is not only an article of prime necessity, but indispensable; but certainly not more so than food or clothing or the shelter of a home. And this court has definitely said that the production or sale of food or clothing cannot be subjected to legislative regulation on the basis of a public use; and that the same is true in respect of the business of renting houses and apartments, except as to temporary measures to tide over grave emergencies. See <em>Tyson &amp; Bro. </em>v. <em>Banton, supra, </em>pp. 437-438, and cases cited.</p>
<p id="b379-5">It has been said that the manufacture of ice requires an expensive plant beyond the means of the average citizen, and thát since the use of ice is indispensable, patronage <page-number citation-index="1" label="278">*278</page-number>of the producer by the consumer is unavoidable. The same might, however, be said in respect of other articles clearly beyond the reach of a restriction like that here under review. But, for the moment conceding the materiality of the statement, it is not now true, whatever may have been the fact in the past. We know, since it is common knowledge, that today, to say nothing of other means, wherever electricity or gas is available (and one or the other is.available in practically every part of the country), anyone for a comparatively moderate outlay may have set up in his kitchen an appliance by means of which he may manufacture ice for himself. Under such circumstances it hardly will do to say that people generally are at the mercy of the manufacturer, seller and distributer of ice for ordinary needs. Moreover, the practical tendency of the restriction, as the trial court suggested in the present case, is to shut out new enterprises, and thus create and foster monopoly in the hands of existing establishments, against, rather than in aid of, the interest of the consuming public.</p>
<p id="b380-6">Plainly, a regulation which has the effect of denying or unreasonably curtailing the common right- to engage in a lawful private business, such as that under review, cannot be upheld consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment. Under that amendment, nothing is more clearly settled than that it is beyond the power of a state, “ under the guise of protecting the public, arbitrarily [to] interfere with private business or. prohibit lawful occupations or impose unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions upon them.” <em>Burns Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>264 U. S. 504, 513, and authorities cited; <em>Liggett Co. </em>v. <em>Baldridge, </em>278 U. S. 105, 113.</p>
<p id="AXZ">Stated succinctly, a private corporation here seeks to prevent a competitor from entering the business of making and selling ice. It claims to be endowed with state authority to achieve this exclusion. There is no' question <page-number citation-index="1" label="279">*279</page-number>now before us of any regulation by the state to protect the consuming public either with respect to conditions of manufacture and distribution or. to insure purity of product or to prevent extortion. The control here asserted does not protect against monopoly, but tends to foster it. The aim is not to encourage competition, but to prevent it; not to regulate the business, but to preclude persons from engaging in it. There is no difference in principle between this case and the attempt of the dairyman under state authority to prevent another from keeping cows and selling milk on the ground that there are enough dairymen in the business; or to*prevent a shoemaker from making or selling shoes because shoemakers already in that occupation can make and sell all the shoes that are needed. We are not able to see anything peculiar in the business here in question which distinguishes it from ordinary manufacture and production. It is said to be recent; but it is the character of the business and not the date when it began that is determinative. It is not the case of a natural monopoly, or of an enterprise in its nature dependent upon the grant of public privileges. The particular requirement before us was evidently not imposed to prevent a practical monopoly of the business, since its tendency is quite to the contrary. Nor is-it a case of ■ the protection of natural resources. There is nothing in the product that we can perceive on which to rest a distinction, in respect of this attempted control, from other products in common use which enter into free competition, subject, of course, to reasonable regulations prescribed for the protection of the public and applied' with appropriate impartiality.</p>
<p id="b381-5">And it is plain that unreasonable or arbitrary interference or restrictions cannot be saved from the condemnation of that Amendment merely by calling them experimental. It is not necessary to challenge the authority of the states to indulge in experimental legislation; but <page-number citation-index="1" label="280">*280</page-number>it would be strange and unwarranted doctrine to hold that they may do so by enactments which transcend the limitations imposed upon them by the federal Constitution. The principle is imbedded in our constitutional system that there are certain essentials of liberty with which the state is not entitled to dispense in the interest of experiments. This principle has been applied by this court in many cases. <em>Dorchy </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>264 U. S. 286; <em>Wolff Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Court, </em>262 U. S. 522, 267 U. S. 552; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Sisters, </em>268 U. S. 510; <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Herndon, </em>273 U. S. 536; <em>Tumey </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>273 U. S. 510; <em>Manley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>279 U. S. 1; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Roberge, </em>278 U. S. 116; <em>Chicago, St. P., M. &amp; O. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Holmberg, </em>282 U. S. 162; <em>Stromberg </em>v. <em>California, </em>283 U. S. 359; <em>Near </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>283 U. S. 697. In. the case last .cited the theory of experimentation in censorship was not permitted to interfere with the fundamental doctrine of the-freedom of the press. The opportunity to apply one’s labor and skill in an ordinary occupation with proper regard' for all reasonable regulations is no less entitled to protection.</p>
