**Dissenting Opinion**
 See Merrion v. Jicaritta Apache Tribe, 617 F. 2d 537 , 545, n. 4 (CA10) (en banc), cert. granted, 449 U. S. 820 (1980).  Even the trial court in the present case recognized that if it reached this question it “would necessarily have to deny the motion to dismiss and proceed to a factual determination.” App. 37a.  As the example of Alaska illustrates, this prospect is not a fanciful one.  Ninety percent of Alaska’s revenue derives from petroleum taxes and royalties; because of the massive sums that have been so raised, that State’s income tax has been eliminated.  See N. Y. Times, June 5, 1981, section 1, p. A10, col. 1.  As noted above, Montana’s severance tax already allegedly accounts for 20% of its total tax revenue, and the State has enacted property and income tax relief.  The Court apparently derives its interpretation of the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test primarily from Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435 (1940), and General Motors Corp. v. Washington, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 436</citedDecision> (1964).  Ante, at 624r-626.  In neither of those cases, however, did the Court consider the question presented here.  J. C. Penney involved a Fourteenth Amendment challenge brought by a foreign corporation to a Wisconsin tax imposed on domestic and foreign corporations “for the privilege of declaring .  .  .  dividends” out of income from property located and business transacted in Wisconsin.  The corporation argued that because the income from the Wisconsin transactions had been transferred to New York, Wisconsin had “no jurisdiction to tax” those amounts.  311 U. S., at 436 .  The Court rejected that argument, holding that “[t]he fact that a tax is contingent upon events brought to pass without a state does not destroy the nexus between such a tax and transactions within a state for which the tax is an exaction.” Id., at 445 .  In General Motors, the question before the Court was the validity of an unapportioned tax on the gross receipts of a corporation in interstate commerce.  The Court concluded that there was a sufficient nexus to uphold the tax. <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 448</citedDecision> .  See <citedDecision>id., at 449-450</citedDecision> (BrenNAN, J., dissenting).  In Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., a telegraph company engaged in interstate commerce challenged both an annual license tax and an annual tax of $2 for each telegraph pole that the company maintained in the city of Richmond, Va. The Court sustained the validity of the license tax on the ground that it was simply a nondiscriminatory “exercise of the police power ... for revenue purposes.” 249 U. S., at 257 .  In contrast, the pole tax was subjected to stricter scrutiny; the Court stated that while interstate commerce must pay its way, the authority remains in the courts, “on proper application, to determine whether, under the conditions prevailing in a given case, the charge made is reasonably proportionate to the service to be rendered and the liabilities involved, or whether it is a disguised attempt to impose a burden on interstate commerce.” Id., at 260 .  The Court has continued to scrutinize carefully taxes on interstate commerce that are designed to reimburse the State for the particular costs imposed by that commerce.  See, e. g„ Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972); Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939); Ingels v. Morf, 300 U. S. 290 (1937).  In analyzing such taxes, it has required that there be factual evidence in the record that “the fees charged do not appear to be manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered.” Clark, 306 U. S., at 599 .  The Court concludes that this test has no bearing here because the Montana Supreme Court held that the coal severance tax was “ ‘imposed for the *648 general support of the government.’ ” Ante, at 621.
