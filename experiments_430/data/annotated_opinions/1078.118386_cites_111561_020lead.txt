 In this case, our inquiry under Agostini’s purpose and effect test is a narrow one.  Because respondents do not challenge the District Court’s holding that Chapter 2 has a secular purpose, and because the Fifth Circuit also did not question that holding, ef.  151 F. 3d, at 369, n. 17 , we will consider only Chapter 2’s effect.  Further, in determining that effect, we will consider only the first two Agostini criteria, since neither respondents nor the Fifth Circuit has questioned the District Court’s holding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a, that Chapter 2 does not create an excessive entanglement.  Considering Chapter 2 in light of our more recent ease law, we conclude that it neither results in religious indoctrination by the government nor defines its recipients by reference to religion.  We therefore hold that Chapter 2 is not a “law respecting an establishment of religion.” In so holding, we acknowledge what both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits saw was inescapable — Meek and Wolman are anomalies in our case law. We therefore conclude that they are no longer good law. *809 A As we indicated in Agostini , and have indicated elsewhere, the question whether governmental aid to religious schools results in governmental indoctrination is ultimately a question whether any religious indoctrination that occurs in those schools could reasonably be attributed to governmental action.  See Agostini, supra, at 226 (presence of sign-language interpreter in Catholic school “ ‘cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking’ ” (quoting Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 ) (emphasis added in Agostini))', 521 U. S., at 230 (question is whether “any use of [governmental] aid to indoctrinate religion could be attributed to the State”); see also Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 841-842; Witters v. Washington Dept., of Servs. for Blind, <citedDecision>474 U. S. 481, 488-489</citedDecision> (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397 (1983); cf. Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 337 (1987) (“For a law to have forbidden 'effects’ under Lemon, it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through its own activities and influence”).  We have also indicated that the answer to the question of indoctrination will resolve the question whether a program of educational aid “subsidizes” religion, as our religion eases use that term. See Agostini , 521U.  S., at 230-231; see also id., at 230 .  In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, we have consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion.  If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government.  For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question.  If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any par *810 ticular indoctrination.

 1988), and that could lead to a program inadvertently favoring one religion or favoring religious private schools in general over nonreligious ones.  The principles of neutrality and private choice, and their relationship to each other, were prominent not only in Agos- *811 Uni, supra, at 225-226, 228, 280-282, but also in Zobrest, Witters, and Mueller .  5 The heart of our reasoning in Zobrest , upholding governmental provision of a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at his Catholic high school, was as follows: “The service at issue in this ease is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as ‘disabled’ under the [statute], without regard to the ‘sectarian-nonseetarian, or publie-nonpublic nature’ of the school the child attends.  By according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents.  In other words, because the [statute] creates no financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school, an interpreter’s presence there cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking.” 509 U. S., at 10 .  As this passage indicates, the private choices helped to ensure neutrality, and neutrality and private choices together eliminated any possible attribution to the government even when the interpreter translated classes on Catholic doctrine.  <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Mueller employed similar reasoning.  In <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from including within a neutral program providing tuition payments for vocational rehabilitation a blind person studying at a Christian college to become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.  We explained: “Any aid .  .  .  that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.  Washington’s *812 program is made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited and .  .. creates no financial incentive for students to undertake sectarian education.  .  .  .  [T]he fact that aid goes to individuals means that the decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not by the State.  “[I]t does not seem appropriate to view any aid ultimately flowing to the Inland Empire School of the Bible as resulting from a state action sponsoring or subsidizing religion.” <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487-488</citedDecision> (footnote, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).  6 Further, five Members of this Court, in separate opinions, emphasized both the importance of neutrality and of private choices, and the relationship between the two.  See <citedDecision>id., at *813490-491</citedDecision> (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring); <citedDecision>id., at 493</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also <citedDecision>id., at 490</citedDecision> (White, J., concurring).  The tax deduction for educational expenses that we upheld in Mueller was, in these respects, the same as the tuition grant in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> .  We upheld it chiefly because it “neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens,” 463 U. S., at 398-399 , and because “numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children,” id., at 399 , determined which schools would benefit from the deductions.  We explained that “[w]here, as here, aid to parochial schools is available only as a result of decisions of individual parents no ‘imprimatur of state approval’ can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally.” Ibid, (citation omitted); see id., at 397 (neutrality indicates lack of state imprimatur).  Agostini's second primary criterion for determining the effect of governmental aid is closely related to the first.  The second criterion requires a court to consider whether an aid program “define[s] its recipients by reference to religion.” 521 U. S., at 234 .  As we briefly explained in Agostini, id., at 230-231 , this second criterion looks to the same set of facts as does our focus, -under the first criterion, on neutrality, see id., at 225-226 , but the second criterion uses those facts to answer a somewhat different question — whether the criteria for allocating the aid “ereat[e] a financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination,” id., at 231 .  In Agos-tini we set out the following rule for answering this question: “This incentive is not present, however, where the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Under such circumstances, the aid is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion.” Ibid. *814 The cases on which Agostini relied for this rule, and Agos-tini itself, make clear the close relationship between this rule, incentives, and private choice.  For to say that a program does not create an incentive to choose religious schools is to say that the private choice is truly “independent,” Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487</citedDecision> .  See Agostini, supra, at 232 (holding that Title I did not create any impermissible incentive, because its services were “available to all children who meet the Act’s eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school”); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (discussing, in successive sentences, neutrality, private choice, and financial incentives, respectively); <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 488</citedDecision> (similar).  When such an incentive does exist, there is a greater risk that one could attribute to the government any indoctrination by the religious schools.  See Zobrest, supra, at 10 .  We hasten to add, what should be obvious from the rule itself, that simply because an aid program offers private schools, and thus religious schools, a benefit that they did not previously receive does not mean that the program, by reducing the cost of securing a religious education, creates, under Agostini’s second criterion, an “incentive” for parents to choose such an education for their children.  For any aid will have some such effect.  See Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 ; Everson, 330 U. S., at 17 ; see also Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 .  B Respondents inexplicably make no effort to address Chapter 2 under the Agostini test.

 They argue first, and chiefly, that “direct, nonineidental” aid to the primary educational mission of religious schools is always impermissible.  Second, they argue that provision to religious schools of aid that is divertible to religious use is similarly impermis *815 sible.  7 Respondents’ arguments are inconsistent with our more recent ease law, in particular Agostini and Zobrest , and we therefore reject them.  1 Although some of our earlier eases, particularly Ball, 473 U. S., at 393-394 , did emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect aid, the purpose of this distinction was *816 merely to prevent “subsidization” of religion, see id., at 394 .  As even the dissent all but admits, see post, at 889 (opinion of Souter, J.), our more recent cases address this purpose not through the direet/indireet distinction but rather through the principle of private choice, as incorporated in the first Agostini criterion (i.  e., whether any indoctrination could be attributed to the government).  If aid to schools, even “direct aid,” is neutrally available and, before reaching or benefiting any religious school, first passes through the hands (literally or figuratively) of numerous private citizens who are free to direct the aid elsewhere, the government has not provided any “support of religion,” <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 489</citedDecision> .  See supra, at 810.  Although the presence of private choice is easier to see when aid literally passes through the hands of individuals — which is why we have mentioned directness in the same breath with private choice, see, e. g., Agostini, 521 U. S., at 226 ; <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 487</citedDecision> ; Mueller, supra, at 399 — there is no reason why the Establishment Clause requires such a form.  Indeed, Agostini expressly rejected the absolute line that respondents would have us draw.  We there explained that “we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.” 521 U. S., at 225 .  Agostini relied primarily on <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> for this conclusion and made clear that private choice and neutrality would resolve the concerns formerly addressed by the rule in Ball .  It was undeniable in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> that the aid (tuition) would ultimately go to the Inland Empire School of the Bible and would support religious education.  We viewed this arrangement, however, as no different from a government issuing a paycheck to one of its employees knowing that the employee would direct the funds to a religious institution.  Both arrangements would be valid, for the same reason: “[A]ny money that ultimately went to religious institutions did so ‘only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of’ individuals.” *817 Agostini, supra, at 226 (quoting Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 487</citedDecision> ).  In addition, the program in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> was neutral.  521 U. S., at 225 (quoting <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 487</citedDecision> ).  As Agostini explained, the same reasoning was at work in Zobrest , where we allowed the government-funded interpreter to provide assistance at a Catholic school, “even though she would he a mouthpiece for religious instruction,” because the interpreter was provided according to neutral eligibility criteria and private choice.  521 U. S., at 226 .  Therefore, the religious messages interpreted by the interpreter could not be attributed to the government, see ibid. (We saw no difference in Zobrest between the government hiring the interpreter direetly and the government providing funds to the parents who then would hire the interpreter.  509 U. S., at 13, n. 11 .) We rejected the dissent’s objection that we had never before allowed “a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination.” See id., at 18 (opinion of Blaekmun, J.).  Finally, in Agostini itself, we used the reasoning of <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest to conclude that remedial classes provided under Title I of the ESEA by public employees did not impermissibly finance religious indoctrination.  521 U. S., at 228 ; see id., at 230-232 .  We found it insignificant that students did not have to direetly apply for Title I services, that Title I instruction was provided to students in groups rather than individually, and that instruction was provided in the facilities of the private schools.  Id., at 226-229 .  To the extent that respondents intend their direct/indireet distinction to require that any aid be literally placed in the hands of schoolchildren rather than given directly to the school for teaching those same children, the very cases on which respondents most rely, Meek and Wolman , demonstrate the irrelevance of such formalism.  In Meek , we justified our rejection of a program that loaned instructional materials and equipment by, among other things, pointing out that the aid was loaned to the schools, and thus was “direct *818 aid.” 421 U. S., at 362-363 .  The materials-and-equipment program in Wolman was essentially identical, except that the State, in an effort to comply with Meek , see Wolman, 433 U. S., at 233, 250 , loaned the aid to the students.
**Lead Opinion**
 Compare Wolman, supra, at 250 (The “technical change in legal bailee” was irrelevant), with Meek, supra, at 391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (“Nor can the fact that the school is the bailee be regarded as constitutionally determinative”).  That Meek and Wolman reached the same result, on programs that were indistinguishable but for the direct/indirect distinction, shows that that distinction played no part in Meek .  Further, respondents’ formalistic line breaks down in the application to real-world programs.  In Allen, for example, although we did recognize that students themselves received and owned the textbooks, we also noted that the books provided were those that the private schools required for courses, that the schools eould collect students’ requests for books and submit them to the board of education, that the schools could store the textbooks, and that the textbooks were essential to the schools’ teaching of secular subjects.  See 392 U. S., at 243-245 .  Whether one chooses to label this program “direct” or “indirect” is a rather arbitrary choice, one that does not further the constitutional analysis.  Of course, we have seen “special Establishment Clause dangers,” Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842, when money is *819 given to religious schools or entities directly rather than, as in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Mueller , indirectly.  See 515 U. S., at 842 (collecting cases); id., at 846-847 (O’Connor, J., concurring); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608-609 (1988); compare Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), with Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472 (1973).  8 But *820 direct payments of money are not at issue in this case, and we refuse to allow a “special” case to create a rule for all cases. 2 Respondents also contend that the Establishment Clause requires that aid to religious schools not be impermissibly religious in nature or be divertible to religious use.  We agree with the first part of this argument but not the second.  Respondents’ “no divertibility” rule is inconsistent with our more recent case law and is unworkable.  So long as the governmental aid is not itself “unsuitable for use in the public schools because of religious content,” Allen, supra, at 245, and eligibility for aid is determined in a constitutionally permissible manner, any use of that aid to indoctrinate cannot be attributed to the government and is thus not of constitutional concern.  And, of course, the use to which the aid is put does not affect the criteria governing the aid’s allocation and thus does not create any impermissible incentive under Agostini’s second criterion.  Our recent precedents, particularly Zobrest , require us to reject respondents’ argument.  For Zobrest gave no consideration to divertibility or even to actual diversion.  Had such things mattered to the Court in Zobrest , we would have found the case to be quite easy — for striking down rather than, as we did, upholding the program — whieh is just how the dissent saw the case. See, e. g., 509 U. S., at 18 (Black-mun, J., dissenting) (“Until now, the Court never has authorized a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination”); id., at 22 (“[government crosses the boundary when it furnishes the medium for communication of a religious message.  ... [A] state-employed sign-language interpreter would serve as the conduit for James’ religious education, thereby assisting Salpointe [High School] in its mission of religious indoctrination”); id., at 23 (interpreter *821 “is likely to place the imprimatur of governmental approval upon the favored religion”); see generally id., at 18-23 .  Quite clearly, then, we did not, as respondents do, think that the use of governmental aid to further religious indoctrination was synonymous with religious indoctrination by the government or that such use of aid created any improper incentives.  Similarly, had we, in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , been concerned with diverti-bility or diversion, we would have unhesitatingly, perhaps summarily, struck down the tuition-reimbursement program, because it was certain that Witters sought to participate in it to acquire an education in a religious career from a sectarian institution.  Diversion was guaranteed.  Mueller took the same view as Zobrest and <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , for we did not in Mueller require the State to show that the tax deductions were only for the costs of education in secular subjects.  We declined to impose any such segregation requirement for either the tuition-expense deductions or the deductions for items strikingly similar to those at issue in Meek and Wolman , and here.  See Mueller, 463 U. S., at 391, n. 2 ; see also id., at 414 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (“The instructional materials which are subsidized by the Minnesota tax deduction plainly may be used to inculcate religious values and belief”).  Justice O’Connor acknowledges that the Court in Zo-brest and <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> approved programs that involved actual diversion.  See post, at 841 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The dissent likewise does not deny that <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> involved actual diversion.  See post, at 895-896, n. 16.  The dissent does claim that the aid in Zobrest “was not considered divertible,” post, at 895, n. 16, but the dissent in Zobrest , which the author of today’s dissent joined, understood the case otherwise.  See supra, at 820.  As that dissent made clear, diversion is the use of government aid to further a religious message.  See Zobrest, supra, at 21-22 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also post, at 842, 857 (O’Con-nor, J., concurring in judgment).  By that definition, the *822 government-provided interpreter in Zobrest was not only divertible, but actually diverted.

 But that period is one that the Court should regret, and it is thankfully long past.  There are numerous reasons to formally dispense with this factor.  First, its relevance in our precedents is in sharp decline.  Although our case law has consistently mentioned it even in recent years, we have not struck down an aid program in reliance on this factor since 1985, in Aguilar and Ball.  Agostini of course overruled Aguilar in Ml and Ball in part, and today Justice O’Connor distances herself from the part of Ball with which she previously agreed, by rejecting the distinction between public and private employees that was so prominent in Agostini .  Compare post, at 858-860, 863-864 (opinion concurring in judgment), with Agos-tini, supra, at 223-225, 234-235.  In <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , a year after Aguilar and Ball , we did not ask whether the Inland Empire School of the Bible was pervasively sectarian.  In Bowen , a 1988 decision, we refused to find facially invalid an aid program (although one not involving schools) whose recipients had, the District Court found, included pervasively sectarian institutions.  See 487 U. S., at 636, 647, 648 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Although we left it open on remand for the District Court to reaffirm its prior finding, we took pains to emphasize the narrowness of the “pervasively sectarian” category, see id., at 620-621 (opinion of the Court), and two *827 Members of the majority questioned whether this category was “well-founded,” id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring).  Then, in Zobrest and Agostini , we upheld aid programs to children who attended schools that were not only pervasively sectarian but also were primary and secondary.  Zobrest , in turning away a challenge based on the pervasively sectarian nature of Salpointe Catholic High School, emphasized the presence of private choice and the absence of government-provided sectarian content.  509 U. S., at 13 .

 But respondents have not contended, nor do we have any reason to think, that this deviation in the allocation to the LEA’s leads to deviation in the allocation among schools within each LEA, see §§ 7372(a)-(b), and, even if it did, we would not presume that such a deviation created any incentive one way or the other with regard to religion.  Chapter 2 also satisfies the first Agostini criterion.  The program makes a broad array of schools eligible for aid without regard to their religious affiliations or lack thereof.  § 7372; see § 7353(a)(3).  We therefore have no difficulty concluding that Ghapter 2 is neutral with regard to religion.  See Agostini, supra, at 225-226 .  Chapter 2 aid also, like the aid in Agostini, Zobrest, and <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> , reaches participating schools only “as a consequence of private decisionmaking.” Agostini, supra, at 222 .  Private decisionmaking controls because of the per capita allocation scheme, and those decisions are independent because of the program’s neutrality.  See 521 U. S., at 226 .  It is the students and their parents— not the government — who, through their choice of school, determine who receives Chapter 2 funds.  The aid follows the child. *831 Because Chapter 2 aid is provided pursuant to private choices, it is not problematic that one could fairly describe Chapter 2 as providing “direct” aid.  The materials and equipment provided under Chapter 2 are presumably used from time to time by entire classes rather than by individual students (although individual students are likely the chief consumers of library books and, perhaps, of computers and computer software), and students themselves do not need to apply for Chapter 2 aid in order for their schools to receive it, but, as we explained in Agostini , these traits are not constitutionally significant or meaningful.  See id., at 228-229 .

 Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947) (upholding reimbursement to párente for costs of busing their children to public or private school).  Cases prior to Everson discussed the issue only indirectly, see, e. g., Vidal v. Philadelphia, 2 How. 127, 198-200 (1844); Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U. S. 50, 81 (1908), or evaluated aid to schools under other provisions of the Constitution, see Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370, 374-375 (1930).  Justice O’Connor acknowledges that “neutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs,” one that our recent eases have “emphasized .  .  .  repeatedly.” Post, at 838 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The majority opinion also noted that only a small portion of the overall aid under the State’s program would go to religious education, see Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> , but it appears that five Members of the Court thought this point irrelevant.  See <citedDecision>id., at 491, n. 8</citedDecision> (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring) (citing Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 401 (1983), to assert that validity of program “does not depend on the fact that petitioner appeal’s to be the only handicapped student who has sought to use his assistance to pursue religious training”); <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 490</citedDecision> (White, J., concurring) (agreeing with “most of Justice Powell’s concurring opinion with respect to the relevance of Mueller,” but not specifying further); <citedDecision>id., at 493</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (agreeing with Justice Powell’s reliance on Mueller and explaining that the program did not have an impermissible effect, because it was neutral and involved private choice, and thus “[n]o reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts before us an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief”).  More recently, in Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997), we held that the proportion of aid benefiting students at religious schools pursuant to a neutral program involving private choices was irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry.  Id., at 229 (refusing “to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid”); see also post, at 848 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting this passage).  Respondents also contend that Chapter 2 aid supplants, rather than supplements, the core educational function of parochial schools and therefore has the effect of furthering religion.  Our case law does provide some indication that this distinction may be relevant to determining whether aid results in governmental indoctrination, see Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228-229 ; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 12 (1993); but see School Dist. of G'rand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 396 (1985), but we have never delineated the distinction’s contours or held that it is constitutionally required.  Nor, to the extent that the supplement/supplant line is separable from respondents’ direct/indireet and “no divertibility” arguments, do we need to resolve the distinction’s constitutional status today, for, as we have already noted, Chapter 2 itself requires that aid may only be supplemental.  20 U. S. C. § 7371 (b).

 App. 112a.  More importantly, neither the District Court nor the Fifth Circuit even hinted that Jefferson Parish had violated § 7371(b), and respondents barely mention the statute in their brief to this Court, offering only the slimmest evidence of any possible violation, see id., at 63a.  Respondents argue that any Chapter 2 aid that a school uses to comply with state requirements (such as those relating to computers and libraries) necessarily violates whatever supplement/supplant line may exist in the Constitution, but our decision in Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), upholding reimbursement to parochial schools of costs relating to state-mandated testing, rejects any such blanket rule.  The reason for such concern is not that the form per se is bad, but that such a form creates special risks that governmental aid will have the effect of advancing religion (or, even more, a purpose of doing so).  An indirect form of payment reduces these risks.  See Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 (neutral tax deduction, because of its indirect form, allowed economic benefit to religious schools only as result of private choice and thus did not suggest state sanction of schools’ religious messages).  It is arguable, however, at least after Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, <citedDecision>474 U. S. 481</citedDecision> (1986), that the principles of neutrality and private choice would be adequate to address those special risks, for it is hard to see the basis for deciding <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> differently simply if the State had sent the tuition check directly to whichever school Witters chose to attend.  See Rosen-berger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 848 (1995) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (explaining <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> as reconciling principle of neutrality with principle against public funding of religious messages by relying on principle of private choice).  Similarly, we doubt it would be unconstitutional if, to modify Witters’ hypothetical, see <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 486-487</citedDecision> ; supra, at 816, a government employer directly sent a portion of an employee’s paycheck to a religious institution designated by that employee pursuant to a neutral charitable program.  We approved a similar arrangement in Quick Bear, 210 U. S., at 77-82 , and the Federal Government appears to have long had such a program, see 1999 Catalog of Caring: Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area 44, 45, 59, 74-75 (listing numerous religious organizations, many of which engage in religious education or in proselytizing, to which federal employees may contribute via payroll deductions); see generally Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788 (1985) (discussing Combined Federal Campaign).  Finally, at least some of our prior cases striking down direct payments involved serious concerns about whether the payments were truly neutral.  See, e. g., Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 762-764, 768, 774-780 (1973) (striking down, by 8-to-l vote, program providing direct grants for maintenance and repair of school facilities, where payments were allocated per-pupil but were only *820 available to private, nonprofit schools in low-income areas, “‘all or practically all’ ” of which were Catholic).
