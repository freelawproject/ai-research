**Concurrence Opinion**
 Commercial price and product advertising differs markedly from ideological expression because it is confined to the promotion of specific goods or services.  7 The First Amendment protects the advertisement because of the “information of potential interest and value” conveyed, Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 822 , rather than because of any direct contribution to the interchange of ideas.  See ante, at 762-765, 770.  8 Since the factual claims contained in commercial price or product advertisements relate to tangible goods or services, they may be tested empirically and corrected to reflect the truth without in any manner jeopardizing the free dis *781 semination of thought.  Indeed, the elimination of false and deceptive claims serves to promote the one facet of commercial price and product advertising that warrants First Amendment protection — its contribution to the flow of accurate and rehable information relevant to public and private decisionmaking.  In recent years the soundness of the sweeping language of the Chrestensen opinion has been repeatedly questioned.  See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 819-821 ; Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 314-315 , and n. 6 (Brennan, J., dissenting); Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm’n, <citedDecision>413 U. S. 376, 398</citedDecision> (Douglas, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>id., at 401</citedDecision> , and n. 6 (Stewart, J., dissenting); Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (Douglas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 .  See, e. g., Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U. S. 507, 520 ; Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 209 ; Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 828 ; Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 115 .  In the labor relations area, governmental regulation of expression by employers has been justified in part by the competing First Amendment associational interests of employees and by the economic dependence of employees on their employers.  See NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S., at 617-618 ; NLRB v. Virginia Electric & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477 .  The Court in Gissel Packing Co. emphasized the NLRB’s expertise in determining whether statements by employers would tend to mislead or coerce employees.  395 U. S., at 620 .
