 II Petitioner argues that Congress through the Act abrogated the States’ immunity from suit.  In order to determine whether Congress has abrogated the States’ sovereign immunity, we ask two questions: first, whether Congress has “unequivocally expresse[d] its intent to abrogate the immunity,” Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68 (1985); and second, whether Congress has acted “pursuant to a valid exercise of power,” ibid. A Congress’ intent to abrogate the States’ immunity from suit must be obvious from “a clear legislative statement.” Blatchford, supra, at 786 .  This rule arises from a recognition of the important role played by the Eleventh Amend *56 ment and the broader principles that it reflects.  See Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 238-239 (1985); Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 345 (1979).  In Atas-cadero, we held that “[a] general authorization for suit in federal court is not the kind of unequivocal statutory language sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment.” 473 U. S., at 246 ; see also Blatchford, supra, at 786, n. 4 (“The fact that Congress grants jurisdiction to hear a claim does not suffice to show Congress has abrogated all defenses to that claim”) (emphases deleted).  Rather, as we said in Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223 (1989): “To temper Congress’ acknowledged powers of abrogation with due concern for the Eleventh Amendment’s role as an essential component of our constitutional structure, we have applied a simple but stringent test: ‘Congress may abrogate the States’ constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.’” Id., at 227-228 .  See also Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., <citedDecision>483 U. S. 468, 474</citedDecision> (1987) (plurality opinion).  Here, we agree with the parties, with the Eleventh Circuit in the decision below, 11 F. 3d, at 1024, and with virtually every other court that has confronted the question 8 that Congress has in § 2710(d)(7) provided an “unmistakably clear” statement of its intent to abrogate.  Section 2710(d)(7)(A)(i) *57 vests jurisdiction in “[t]he United States district courts .  .  .  over any cause of action .■.  .

 It was well established in 1989 when Union Gas was decided that the Eleventh Amendment stood for the constitutional principle that state sovereign immunity limited the federal courts’ jurisdiction under Article III. The text of the Amendment itself is clear enough on this point: “The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit.  ...” And our decisions since Hans had been equally clear that the Eleventh Amendment reflects “the fundamental principle of sovereign immunity [that] limits the grant of judicial authority in Art. III,” Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 97-98 (1984); see Union Gas, supra, at 38 (“ ‘[T]he entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given ...’”) (Scalia, *65 J., dissenting) (quoting Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 497 (1921)); see also cases cited at n. 7, supra. As the dissent in Union Gas recognized, the plurality’s conclusion — that Congress could under Article I expand the scope of the federal courts’ jurisdiction under Article III — “contradicted] our unvarying approach to Article III as setting forth the exclusive catalog of permissible federal-court jurisdiction.” Union Gas, supra, at 39.  Never before the decision in Union Gas had we suggested that the bounds of Article III could be expanded by Congress operating pursuant to any constitutional provision other than the Fourteenth Amendment.  Indeed, it had seemed fundamental that Congress could not expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts beyond the bounds of Article III. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803).  The plurality’s citation of prior decisions for support was based upon what we believe to be a misreading of precedent.  See Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 40-41 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The plurality claimed support for its decision from a case holding the unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that the States may waive their sovereign immunity, see id., at 14-15 (citing Parden v. Terminal Railway of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184 (1964)), and cited as precedent propositions that had been merely assumed for the sake of argument in earlier cases, see 491 U. S., at 15 (citing <citedDecision>Welch</citedDecision> v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., <citedDecision>483 U. S., at 475-476</citedDecision> , and n. 5, and County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. 470 U. S., at 252 ).  The plurality’s extended reliance upon our decision in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), that Congress could under the Fourteenth Amendment abrogate the States’ sovereign immunity was also, we believe, misplaced.  Fitzpatrick was based upon a rationale wholly inapplicable to the Interstate Commerce Clause, viz., that the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted well after the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment and the ratification of the Constitution, oper *66 ated to alter the pre-existing balance between state and federal power achieved by Article III and the Eleventh Amendment.  Id., at 454 .  As the dissent in Union Gas made clear, Fitzpatrick cannot be read to justify “limitation of the principle embodied in the Eleventh Amendment through appeal to antecedent provisions of the Constitution.” Union Gas, supra, at 42 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  In the five years since it was decided, Union Gas has proved to be a solitary departure from established law. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139 (1993).  Reconsidering the decision in Union Gas, we conclude that none of the policies underlying stare decisis require our continuing adherence to its holding.

 Following its conclusion that petitioner’s suit should be dismissed, the Court of Appeals went on to consider how § 2710(d)(7) would operate in the wake of its decision.  The court decided that those provisions of § 2710(d)(7) that were problematic could be severed from the rest of the section, and read the surviving provisions of § 2710(d)(7) to provide an Indian tribe with immediate recourse to the Secretary of the Interior from the dismissal of a suit against a State.  11 F. 3d 1016 , 1029 (1994).  Respondents filed a cross-petition, No. 94-219, challenging only the Eleventh Circuit’s modification of § 2710(d)(7), see n. 4, supra. That petition is still pending.

Justice Souter, in his dissenting opinion, argues that in order to avoid a constitutional question, we should interpret the Act to provide only a suit against state officials rather than a suit against the State itself.  Post, at 182.  But in light of the plain text of § 2710(d)(7)(B), we disagree with the dissent’s assertion that the Act can reasonably be read in that way.  “We cannot press statutory construction ‘to the point of disingenuous evasion’ even to avoid a constitutional question.” See United States v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 96 (1985), quoting George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U. S. 373, 379 (1933) (Cardozo, J.).  We already have found the clear statement rule satisfied, and that finding renders the preference for avoiding a constitutional question inapplicable.

 .”).  These statements, however, are dicta in the classic sense, that is, sheer speculation about what would happen in cases not before the court. 20 But this *126 is not the only weakness of these statements, which are counterbalanced by many other opinions that have either stated the immunity principle without more, see, e. g., Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 229, n. 2 (1989) (noting that “an uncon-senting State is immune from liability for damages in a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens,” without suggesting that the immunity was unalterable by Congress), 21 or have suggested that the Hans immunity is not of constitutional stature.  The very language quoted by the majority from Monaco, for example, likens state sovereign immunity to other “essential postulates” such as the rules of justiciability.  292 U. S., at 322 .  Many of those rules, as Justice Stevens points out, are prudential in nature and therefore not unalterable by Congress.  See ante, at 88-90.  22 More generally, the proponents of the Court’s theory have repeatedly referred to state sovereign immunity as a “background principle,” ante, at 72, “postulate,” Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 437 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), or “implicit limitation,” Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., <citedDecision>483 U. S. 468, 496</citedDecision> (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and as resting on the “inherent nature of sovereignty,” Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), rather than any explicit con *127 stitutional provision.  23 But whatever set of quotations one may prefer, taking heed of such jurisprudential creations in assessing the contents of federal common law is a very different thing from reading them into the Founding Document itself.  The most damning evidence for the Court’s theory that Hans rests on a broad rationale of immunity unalterable by Congress, however, is the Court’s proven tendency to disregard the post-Hans dicta in cases where that dicta would have mattered.  24 If it is indeed true that “private suits against States [are] not permitted under Article III (by virtue of the understanding represented by the Eleventh Amendment),” Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 40 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), then it is hard to see how a State’s sovereign immunity may be waived any more than it may be abrogated by Congress.  See, e. g., Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 238 (recognizing that immunity may be waived).  After all, consent of a party is in all other instances wholly insufficient to create subject- *128 matter jurisdiction where it would not otherwise exist.  See, e. g., Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 398 (1975); see also E. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction § 7.6, p. 405 (2d ed. 1994) (noting that “allowing such waivers seems inconsistent with viewing the Eleventh Amendment as a restriction on the federal courts’ subject matter jurisdiction”).

 If “the whole sum of the judicial power granted by the Constitution to the United States does not embrace the authority to entertain a suit brought by a citizen against his own State without its consent,” Duhne v. New Jersey, 251 U. S. 311, 313 (1920), and if consent to suit in state court is not sufficient to show consent in federal court, see Atascadero, supra, at 241 , then Article III would hardly permit this Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction over issues of federal law arising in lawsuits brought against the States in their own courts.  We have, however, quite rightly ignored any post-Hans dicta in that sort of case and exercised the jurisdiction that the plain text of Article III provides.  See, e. g., Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325 (1996); see also supra, at 113-114.  *127 “As it was not the Eleventh Amendment by its terms which justified the result in Hans , it is not the Tenth Amendment by its terms that prohibits congressional action which sets a mandatory ceiling on the wages of all state employees.  Both Amendments are simply examples of the understanding of those who drafted and ratified the Constitution that the States were sovereign in many respects, and that although their legislative authority could be superseded by Congress in many areas where Congress was competent to act, Congress was nonetheless not free to deal with a State as if it were just another individual or business enterprise subject to regulation.” Id., at 556-557 (dissenting opinion).  *128 If these examples were not enough to distinguish Hans’s rationale of a pre-existing doctrine of sovereign immunity from the post-Hans dicta indicating that this immunity is constitutional, one would need only to consider a final set of cases: those in which we have assumed, without deciding, that congressional power to abrogate state sovereign immunity exists even when § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment has no application.  A majority of this Court was willing to make that assumption in Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96, 101 (1989) (plurality opinion), in <citedDecision>Welch</citedDecision> v. Texas Dept. of Highways and, Public Transp., supra, at 475 (plurality opinion), and in County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226, 252 *129 (1985).  25 Although the Court in each of these cases failed to find abrogation for lack of a clear statement of congressional intent, the assumption that such power was available would hardly have been permissible if, at that time, today’s majority’s view of the law had been firmly established.  It is one thing, after all, to avoid an open constitutional question by assuming an answer and rejecting the claim on another ground; it is quite another to avoid a settled rationale (an emphatically settled one if the majority is to be taken seriously) only to reach an issue of statutory construction that the Court would otherwise not have to decide.  Even worse, the Court could not have been unaware that its decision of cases like Hoffman and <citedDecision>Welch</citedDecision> , on the ground that the statutes at issue lacked a plain statement of intent to abrogate, would invite Congress to attempt abrogation in statutes like the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U. S. C. § 2701 et seq. (IGRA).  Such a course would have been wholly irresponsible if, as the majority now claims, the constitutionally unalterable nature of Hans immunity had been well established for a hundred years.  Hans itself recognized that an “observation [in a prior case that] was unnecessary to the decision, and in that sense extra judicial .  .  .  ought not to outweigh” present reasoning that points to a different conclusion.  134 U. S., at 20 .

 .  and of the people of the United States ... to define with precision the objects of the legislative power, and to restrain its exercise within marked and settled boundaries.  If any act of Congress, or of the Legislature of a state, violates those constitutional provisions, it is unquestionably void.  ... If, on the other hand, the Legislature of the Union, or the Legislature of any member of the Union, shall pass a law, within the general scope of their constitutional power, the Court cannot pronounce it to be void, merely because it is, in their judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice.  The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard: the ablest and the purest men have differed upon the subject; and all that the Court could properly say, in such an event, would be, that the Legislature (possessed of an equal right of opinion) had passed an act which, in the opinion of the judges, was inconsistent with the abstract principles of natural justice.” Id., at 398-399 (emphasis deleted) (opinion dissenting in part).  Later jurisprudence vindicated Justice Iredell’s view, and the idea that “first principles” or concepts of “natural justice” might take precedence over the Constitution or other positive law “all but disappeared in American discourse.” J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 52 (1980).  It should take more than references to “background principle^],” ante, at 72, and “implicit limitation^],” Welch, <citedDecision>483 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), to revive the judicial power to overcome clear text unopposed to any other provision, when that clear text is in harmony with an almost equally clear intent on the part of the Framers and the constitutionalists of their generation.  *169 > The Court s holding that the States Hans immunity may not be abrogated by Congress leads to the final question in this case, whether federal-question jurisdiction exists to order prospective relief enforcing IGRA against a state officer, respondent Chiles, who is said to be authorized to take the action required by the federal law. Just as with the issue about authority to order the State as such, this question is entirely jurisdictional, and we need not consider here whether petitioner Seminole Tribe would have a meritorious argument for relief, or how much practical relief the requested order (to bargain in good faith) would actually provide to the Tribe.  Nor, of course, does the issue turn in any way on one’s views about the scope of the Eleventh Amendment or Hans and its doctrine, for we ask whether the state officer is subject to jurisdiction only on the assumption that action directly against the State is barred.  The answer to this question is an easy yes, the officer is subject to suit under the rule in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), and the case could, and should, readily be decided on this point alone.  A In Ex parte Young, this Court held that a federal court has jurisdiction in a suit against a state officer to enjoin official actions violating federal law, even though the State itself may be immune.  Under Young, “a federal court, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, may enjoin state officials to conform their future conduct to the requirements of federal law.” Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 337 (1979); see also Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 289 (1977).  The fact, without more, that such suits may have a significant impact on state governments does not count under Young.

Indeed, in Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 439 , The Chief Justice complained in dissent that the same statements upon which he relies today had been “dismiss[ed]... as dicta.” In Hoffman , one Member of the four Justice plurality expressly disavowed the plurality’s assumption that Congress could abrogate the States’ immunity by making its intent to do so clear.  See 492 U. S., at 105 (O’Connor, J., concurring).  The four dissenters, however, not only assumed that Congress had the power to abrogate but found that it had done so. See id,., at 106 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Likewise, in <citedDecision>Welch</citedDecision> , the four-Justice plurality was joined by four dissenters who insisted upon a congressional power of abrogation.  See 483 U. S., at 519 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  The Court seeks to disparage the common-law roots of the doctrine, and the consequences of those roots which I outline infra, at 132-142 and 159-164, by asserting that Hans “found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental ‘ “jurisprudence in all *131 civilized nations.’”” Ante, at 69 (quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 17 ).  The Hans Court, however, relied explicitly on the ground that a suit against the State by its own citizen was “not known ... at the common law” and was not among the departures from the common law recognized by the Constitution.  Id., at 15 .  Moreover, Hans explicitly adopted the reasoning of Justice Iredell’s dissent in Chisholm , see 134 U. S., at 18-19 , and that opinion could hardly have been clearer in relying exclusively on the common law. “The only principles of law .  .. which can affect this case,” Justice Iredell wrote, “[are] those that are derived from what is properly termed ‘the common law,’ a law which I presume is the ground-work of the laws in every State in the Union, and which I consider, so far as it is applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the country, and where no special act of Legislation eontrouls it, to be in force in each State, as it existed in England, (unaltered by any statute) at the time of the first settlement of the country.” 2 Dall., at 435 (emphasis deleted).

It is one thing, after all, to avoid an open constitutional question by assuming an answer and rejecting the claim on another ground; it is quite another to avoid a settled rationale (an emphatically settled one if the majority is to be taken seriously) only to reach an issue of statutory construction that the Court would otherwise not have to decide.  Even worse, the Court could not have been unaware that its decision of cases like Hoffman and <citedDecision>Welch</citedDecision> , on the ground that the statutes at issue lacked a plain statement of intent to abrogate, would invite Congress to attempt abrogation in statutes like the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U. S. C. § 2701 et seq. (IGRA).  Such a course would have been wholly irresponsible if, as the majority now claims, the constitutionally unalterable nature of Hans immunity had been well established for a hundred years.  Hans itself recognized that an “observation [in a prior case that] was unnecessary to the decision, and in that sense extra judicial .  .  .  ought not to outweigh” present reasoning that points to a different conclusion.  134 U. S., at 20 .

 .  and of the people of the United States ... to define with precision the objects of the legislative power, and to restrain its exercise within marked and settled boundaries.  If any act of Congress, or of the Legislature of a state, violates those constitutional provisions, it is unquestionably void.  ... If, on the other hand, the Legislature of the Union, or the Legislature of any member of the Union, shall pass a law, within the general scope of their constitutional power, the Court cannot pronounce it to be void, merely because it is, in their judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice.  The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard: the ablest and the purest men have differed upon the subject; and all that the Court could properly say, in such an event, would be, that the Legislature (possessed of an equal right of opinion) had passed an act which, in the opinion of the judges, was inconsistent with the abstract principles of natural justice.” Id., at 398-399 (emphasis deleted) (opinion dissenting in part).  Later jurisprudence vindicated Justice Iredell’s view, and the idea that “first principles” or concepts of “natural justice” might take precedence over the Constitution or other positive law “all but disappeared in American discourse.” J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 52 (1980).  It should take more than references to “background principle^],” ante, at 72, and “implicit limitation^],” Welch, <citedDecision>483 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), to revive the judicial power to overcome clear text unopposed to any other provision, when that clear text is in harmony with an almost equally clear intent on the part of the Framers and the constitutionalists of their generation.  *169 > The Court s holding that the States Hans immunity may not be abrogated by Congress leads to the final question in this case, whether federal-question jurisdiction exists to order prospective relief enforcing IGRA against a state officer, respondent Chiles, who is said to be authorized to take the action required by the federal law. Just as with the issue about authority to order the State as such, this question is entirely jurisdictional, and we need not consider here whether petitioner Seminole Tribe would have a meritorious argument for relief, or how much practical relief the requested order (to bargain in good faith) would actually provide to the Tribe.  Nor, of course, does the issue turn in any way on one’s views about the scope of the Eleventh Amendment or Hans and its doctrine, for we ask whether the state officer is subject to jurisdiction only on the assumption that action directly against the State is barred.  The answer to this question is an easy yes, the officer is subject to suit under the rule in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), and the case could, and should, readily be decided on this point alone.  A In Ex parte Young, this Court held that a federal court has jurisdiction in a suit against a state officer to enjoin official actions violating federal law, even though the State itself may be immune.  Under Young, “a federal court, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, may enjoin state officials to conform their future conduct to the requirements of federal law.” Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 337 (1979); see also Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 289 (1977).  The fact, without more, that such suits may have a significant impact on state governments does not count under Young.

S. 490, 501 (1975) (“Congress may grant an express right of action to persons who otherwise would be barred by prudential standing rules”); E. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction §2.1, pp. 42-43 (2d ed. 1994).  Indeed, The Chief Justice could hardly have been clearer in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), where he explained that “[t]he Court’s decision in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), offers impressive authority for the principle that the States as such were regarded by the Framers of the Constitution as partaking of many attributes of sovereignty quite apart from the provisions of the Tenth Amendment.... Indeed, in Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 439 , The Chief Justice complained in dissent that the same statements upon which he relies today had been “dismiss[ed]... as dicta.” In Hoffman , one Member of the four Justice plurality expressly disavowed the plurality’s assumption that Congress could abrogate the States’ immunity by making its intent to do so clear.  See 492 U. S., at 105 (O’Connor, J., concurring).  The four dissenters, however, not only assumed that Congress had the power to abrogate but found that it had done so. See id,., at 106 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Likewise, in <citedDecision>Welch</citedDecision> , the four-Justice plurality was joined by four dissenters who insisted upon a congressional power of abrogation.  See 483 U. S., at 519 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  The Court seeks to disparage the common-law roots of the doctrine, and the consequences of those roots which I outline infra, at 132-142 and 159-164, by asserting that Hans “found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental ‘ “jurisprudence in all *131 civilized nations.’”” Ante, at 69 (quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 17 ).  The Hans Court, however, relied explicitly on the ground that a suit against the State by its own citizen was “not known ... at the common law” and was not among the departures from the common law recognized by the Constitution.  Id., at 15 .  Moreover, Hans explicitly adopted the reasoning of Justice Iredell’s dissent in Chisholm , see 134 U. S., at 18-19 , and that opinion could hardly have been clearer in relying exclusively on the common law. “The only principles of law .  .. which can affect this case,” Justice Iredell wrote, “[are] those that are derived from what is properly termed ‘the common law,’ a law which I presume is the ground-work of the laws in every State in the Union, and which I consider, so far as it is applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the country, and where no special act of Legislation eontrouls it, to be in force in each State, as it existed in England, (unaltered by any statute) at the time of the first settlement of the country.” 2 Dall., at 435 (emphasis deleted).
