**Lead Opinion**
 The factor which distinguishes the present case from Estin is that here the wife’s right to support had not been reduced to judgment prior to the husband’s ex parte divorce.  In our opinion this difference is not material on the question before us.  Since the wife was not subject to its jurisdiction, the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which she had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband.  It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.  6 Here, the Nevada divorce court *419 was as powerless to cut off the wife’s support right as it would have been to order the husband to pay alimony if the wife had brought the divorce action and he had not been subject to the divorce court’s jurisdiction.  Therefore, the Nevada decree, to the extent it purported to affect the wife’s right to support, was void and the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not obligate New York to give it recognition.  7 Petitioner claims that this case is governed by Thompson v. Thompson, <citedDecision>226 U. S. 551</citedDecision> .  For the reasons given in a concurring opinion in Armstrong v. Armstrong, 350 U. S. 568, 575 , at 580-581, the <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> case, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.  Affirmed.  The Chief Justice took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. It seems clear that in Nevada the effect of this decree was to put an end to the husband’s duty to support the wife — provided, of course, that the Nevada courts had power to do this.  Sweeney v.

**Dissenting Opinion**
 The Court rightly regarded the fact as crucial because of the requirement of Art. IV, § 1, that Nevada give full faith and credit to the prior New York “judicial Proceedings.” The Court now chooses to regard the existence of a prior New York support order as “not material,” holding for the first time that “the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which [respondent] had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband.  It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant [citing for this proposition, Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 726-727 ].” We have thus reached another stage — one cannot say it is the last — in the Court’s tortuous course of constitutional adjudication relating to dissolution of the marriage status.  Whereas previously only the State of “matrimonial domicile” could grant an ex parte divorce and alimony, now any domiciliary State can grant an ex parte divorce, but no State, even if domiciliary, can grant alimony ex parte when it grants a divorce ex parte.  *421 It will make for clarity to give a brief review of the singular history of matrimonial law in this Court since the decision in Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S. 155 .  In that case, the Court held that a sister State had to give full faith and credit to a divorce granted, on the basis of constructive service, by the matrimonial domicile to a deserted husband.  In Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U. S. 562 , the Court refused to extend Atherton , holding that a State need not give full faith and credit to a divorce granted ex parte to a deserted husband by a domiciliary State other than the matrimonial domicile.  These precedents were applied to the incidental claim to alimony in Thompson v. Thompson, <citedDecision>226 U. S. 551</citedDecision> , where the Court held that full faith and credit was to be given to the refusal of the matrimonial domicile to grant alimony when it granted a divorce on the basis of substituted service.  Under the pre-Williams law, then, the same jurisdictional rules applied to the dissolution of the marriage tie and to an incidental adjudication denying alimony.  Not only the adjudication of divorce but also the adjudication denying alimony by the matrimonial domicile was required to be given full faith and credit despite the lack of personal jurisdiction over the other spouse.  In Williams v. North Carolina, I, 317 U. S. 287 , the scope of Art. IV, § 1, was found to require full faith and credit to be given to a divorce granted ex parte by any State where one spouse was domiciled.  The limitation of ex parte divorces to the matrimonial domicile imposed by Haddock v. Haddock was rejected as being based on “fiction.” Williams v. North Carolina, II, 325 U. S. 226 , made it clear that full faith and credit was required to be given only if the granting State was actually a domiciliary State, that the finding on this issue could not be foreclosed by the decreeing State, and that it could be readjudicated later by another State.  But this restriction of Williams II was considerably weakened *422 when the Court held that a sister State, no matter how great its interest because of its own social policy, was precluded from relitigating the existence of the jurisdictional facts underlying a divorce when both parties had merely made an appearance in the original divorce proceeding.  Sherrer v. Sherrer, 334 U. S. 343 , and Coe v. Coe, 334 U. S. 378 .  This was so even if the collateral attack were made by a third party who had not appeared in the original proceeding and who had independent interests.  Johnson v. Muelberger, 340 U. S. 581 .  The decisions from Williams I through Johnson resulted in a broad extension of the scope of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  Haddock v. Haddock was rejected, not because it gave too little respect to the rights of the absent spouse, but rather because it gave too much respect to those rights, and not enough to the rights of the other spouse and his or her domiciliary State.  The interests of the absent spouses were subordinated to the interests of the other spouses and their domicile of divorce in Williams I, and the interests of a State that was allegedly both pre-divorce and post-divorce domicile were subordinated to the interest of the temporary “domicile” of divorce in Sherrer and Coe .  One might have expected that since <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Thompson, supra,</citedDecision> was based on Haddock v. Haddock , it would have suffered the same fate. But no. The law is not so logical.  The Court shrinks from applying Williams I to <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> .  In fact, we are now told that the vice of <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> is just the opposite of that of Haddock v. Haddock: Thompson paid too little respect to the rights of the absent spouse and too much to the rights of the other spouse and his domicile.  And so, as compensation, the interests of the absent spouse, which the Court subordinated so far as the breaking up of the marital relation was concerned in Williams I, are now to be enlarged, so far as alimony is concerned.  The require *423 ment of Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714 , that there must be personal jurisdiction in an action to recover a judgment for personal services rendered, was before the Court in Haddock , in <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> , and in Williams I.  Although it was found in all three cases not to be applicable to the unique interests and factors pertaining to the severance of the marriage status and the incidental determination denying alimony, it is now treated as a controlling precedent.  A normal action for divorce comprehends dissolution of the marital relation and, incident thereto, a property arrangement between the parties.  I stand on the Williams decisions; and so I start from the proposition that full faith and credit must be given to an ex parte divorce granted by a State that is the domicile of one of the parties.  The only legal question for our concern in this case is whether the other aspect of, and indeed an incident to, a proceeding for divorce, the property arrangement, is similar enough to the dissolution of the marital relation, with respect to both the interests of the parties and the nature of what is adjudicated, that constitutionally it may be treated alike.  Haddock v. Haddock and <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> proceeded on the basis that they should be treated alike.  The Court, however, solves all with the statement, “It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.” This is an artful disguise for labeling the action with the question-begging phrase, “in personam.” A dogmatic, unanalyzed disregard of the difficulties of a problem does not make the problem disappear.  Strictly speaking, all rights eventually are “personal.” For example, a successful suit in admiralty against a ship results of course not in loss to the ship but to its owner.  The crucial question is: what is the fair way to proceed against these *424 interests?  May a State deal with the dissolution of a marriage comprehensively, or must it chop up the normal incidents of the cause of action for divorce?  No explanation is vouchsafed why the dissolution of the marital relation is not so “personal” as to require personal jurisdiction over an absent spouse, while the denial of alimony incident thereto is.  Calling alimony a “personal claim or obligation” solves nothing.
**Combined Opinion**
 The factor which distinguishes the present case from Estin is that here the wife's right to support had not been reduced to judgment prior to the husband's ex parte divorce.  In our opinion this difference is not material on the question before us.  Since the wife was not subject to its jurisdiction, the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which she had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband.  It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.  [6] Here, the Nevada divorce court *419 was as powerless to cut off the wife's support right as it would have been to order the husband to pay alimony if the wife had brought the divorce action and he had not been subject to the divorce court's jurisdiction.  Therefore, the Nevada decree, to the extent it purported to affect the wife's right to support, was void and the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not obligate New York to give it recognition.  [7] Petitioner claims that this case is governed by Thompson v. Thompson, <citedDecision>226 U. S. 551</citedDecision> .  For the reasons given in a concurring opinion in Armstrong v. Armstrong, 350 U. S. 568, 575 , at 580-581, the <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> case, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.  Affirmed.  THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.  The question in this case is whether Nevada, which was empowered to grant petitioner a divorce without personal jurisdiction over respondent that must be respected, by command of the Constitution, by every other State, Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287 , *420 was at the same time empowered by virtue of its domiciliary connection with petitioner to make, incidental to its dissolution of the marriage, an adjudication denying alimony to which sister States must also give full faith and credit.  Whatever the answer to the question may be, Estin v. Estin, 334 U. S. 541 , does not supply it.  What the Court now states to be "not material" was crucial to the decision in that case, namely, the prior New York support order, which the Court held Nevada was required to respect by virtue of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, § 1, of the Constitution.  That this fact was crucial to the Court's decision in that case is made clear by the Court's reference to the prior New York judgment in its two statements of the question presented and more than a half dozen times throughout the course of its opinion.
