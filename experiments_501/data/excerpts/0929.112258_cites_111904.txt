 App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a, 43a-47a.  The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, utilized the Martinez standard, found the regulations wanting, *404 and remanded the case to the District Court for an individualized determination of the constitutionality of the 46 exclusions.  Abbott v. Meese, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 824 F. 2d 1166 (1987).  Petitioners, officials of the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Prisons, sought certiorari.  We granted the writ in order to determine the appropriate standard of review.  Meese v. Abbott, 485 U. S. 1020 (1988).  We now hold that the District Court correctly anticipated that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the regulations are “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,” Turner v. Safley, <citedDecision>482 U. S. 78, 89</citedDecision> (1987), and we conclude that under this standard the regulations are facially valid.  We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals on the issue of facial validity, but we agree with that court’s remand of the case to the District Court for a determination of the validity of the regulations as applied to each of the 46 publications.  II We are concerned primarily with the regulations set forth at 28 CFR §§540.70 and 540.71 (1988), first promulgated in 1979.  3 These generally permit an inmate to subscribe to, or to receive, a publication without prior approval, 4 but authorize the warden to reject a publication in certain circumstances.  The warden may reject it “only if it is determined detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity.” *405 § 540.71(b).  The warden, however, may not reject a publication “solely because its content is religious, philosophical, political, social or sexual, or because its content is unpopular or repugnant.” Ibid. The regulations contain a nonexhaustive list of criteria which may support rejection of a publication.  5 The warden is prohibited from establishing an excluded list of publications: each issue of a subscription publication is to be reviewed separately.

 The publisher or sender may obtain an independent review of the warden’s rejection decision by a timely writing to the Regional Director of the Bureau.  § 540.71(e).  An inmate may appeal through the Bureau’s Administrative Remedy Procedure.  See §§542.10 to 542.16.  7 The warden is instructed to permit the inmate to review the rejected material for the purpose of filing an appeal “unless such review may provide the inmate with information of a nature which is deemed to pose a threat or detriment to the security, good order or discipline of the institution or to encourage or instruct in criminal activity.” §540.71(d).  8 *407 III There is little doubt that the kind of censorship just described would raise grave First Amendment concerns outside the prison context.  It is equally certain that “[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution,” <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> v. Safley, <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 84</citedDecision> , nor do they bar free citizens from exercising their own constitutional rights by reaching out to those on the “inside,” <citedDecision>id., at 94-99</citedDecision> ; Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S. 119 (1977); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817 (1974).  We have recognized, however, that these rights must be exercised with due regard for the “inordinately difficult undertaking” that is modern prison administration.  <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> v. Safley, <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 85</citedDecision> .  In particular, we have been sensitive to the delicate balance that prison administrators must strike between the order and security of the internal prison environment and the legitimate demands of those on the “outside” who seek to enter that environment, in person or through the written word.  Many categories of noninmates seek access to prisons.  Access is essential to lawyers and legal assistants representing prisoner clients, see Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396 (1974), to journalists seeking information about prison conditions, see Pell v. Procunier, supra, and to families and friends of prisoners who seek to sustain relationships with them, see Procunier v. Martinez, supra. All these claims to prison access undoubtedly are legitimate; yet prison officials may well conclude that certain proposed interactions, though seemingly innocuous to laymen, have potentially significant implications for the order and security of the prison.  Acknowledging the expertise of these officials and that the judiciary is “ill equipped” to deal with the difficult *408 and delicate problems of prison management, this Court has afforded considerable deference to the determinations of prison administrators who, in the interest of security, regulate the relations between prisoners and the outside world.  Id., at 404-405 .  In this case, there is no question that publishers who wish to communicate with those who, through subscription, willingly seek their point of view have a legitimate First Amendment interest in access to prisoners.

 *409 It is clear from this language, however, that we did not deprive prison officials of the degree of discretion necessary to vindicate “the particular governmental interest involved.” Accordingly, we said: “Some latitude in anticipating the probable consequences of allowing certain speech in a prison environment is essential to the proper discharge of an administrator’s duty.  But any regulation or practice that restricts inmate correspondence must be generally necessary to protect one or more .  .  .  legitimate governmental interests.” Id., at 414 .  The Court’s subsequent decisions regarding First Amendment rights in the prison context, however, laid down a different standard of review from that articulated in Martinez .  As recently explained in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> , these later decisions, which we characterized as involving “prisoners’ rights,” adopted a standard of review that focuses on the reasonableness of prison regulations: the relevant inquiry is whether the actions of prison officials were “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 89</citedDecision> .  The Court ruled that “such a standard is necessary if ‘prison administrators .  .  .  , and not the courts, [are] to make- the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations.’” Ibid., quoting Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S., at 128 .  The Court set forth in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> the development of this reasonableness standard in the respective decisions in Pell and Jones and in Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576 (1984), and we need not repeat that discussion here.  The Court’s decision to apply a reasonableness standard in these cases rather than Martinez’ less deferential approach stemmed from its concern that language in Martinez might be too readily understood as establishing a standard of “strict” or “heightened” scrutiny, and that such a strict *410 standard simply was not appropriate for consideration of regulations that are centrally concerned with the maintenance of order and security within prisons.  9 See <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> v. Safley, <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 81, 87, 89</citedDecision> .  Specifically, the Court declined to apply the Martinez standard in “prisoners’ rights” cases because, as was noted in Turner, Martinez could be (and had been) read to require a strict “least restrictive alternative” analysis, without sufficient sensitivity to the need for discretion in meeting legitimate prison needs.  <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 89-90</citedDecision> .  The Court expressed concern that “every administrative judgment would be subject to the possibility that some court somewhere would conclude that it had a less restrictive way *411 of solving the problem at hand,” <citedDecision>id., at 89</citedDecision> , and rejected the costs of a “least restrictive alternative” rule as too high.  <citedDecision>Id., at 90</citedDecision> .  See also O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342, 350 (1987) (refusing to apply a least restrictive alternative standard for regulation of prisoner work rules having an impact on religious observance).  We do not believe that Martinez should, or need, be read as subjecting the decisions of prison officials to a strict “least restrictive means” test.  As noted, Martinez required no more than that a challenged regulation be “generally necessary” to a legitimate governmental interest.  416 U. S., at 414 .  Certainly, Martinez required a close fit between the challenged regulation and the interest it purported to serve.  But a careful reading of Martinez suggests that our rejection of the regulation at issue resulted not from a least restrictive means requirement, but from our recognition that the regulated activity centrally at issue in that case — outgoing personal correspondence from prisoners — did not, by its very nature, pose a serious threat to prison order and security.

 Furthermore, prisoners may observe particular material in the possession of a fellow prisoner, draw inferences about their fellow’s beliefs, sexual orientation, or gang affiliations from that material, and cause disorder by acting accord *413 ingly.  See App. 22-23, 52, 59, 88; see generally Prisoners and the Law 3-14 (I.  Robbins ed. 1988) (noting that possession of homosexually explicit material may identify the possessor as homosexual and target him for assault).  As the Deputy Solicitor General noted at oral argument: “The prob-' lem is not ... in the individual reading the materials in most cases. The problem is in the material getting into the prison.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 10.  See also id., at 26; App. 10.  In the volatile prison environment, it is essential that prison officials be given broad discretion to prevent such disorder.  In <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> , we dealt with incoming personal correspondence from prisoners; the impact of the correspondence on the internal environment of the prison was of great concern.  There, we recognized that Martinez was too readily understood as failing to afford prison officials sufficient discretion to protect prison security.  In light of these same concerns, we now hold that regulations affecting the sending of a “publication” (see the regulations’ specific definition of this word, n. 4, supra) to a prisoner must be analyzed under the <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> reasonableness standard.  Such regulations are “valid if [they are] reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Turner, <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 89</citedDecision> .  Furthermore, we acknowledge today that the logic of our analyses in Martinez and <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> requires that Martinez be limited to regulations concerning outgoing correspondence.  As we have observed, outgoing correspondence was the central focus of our opinion in Martinez .  The implications of outgoing correspondence for prison security are of a categorically lesser magnitude than the implications of incoming materials.  Any attempt to justify a similar categorical distinction between incoming correspondence from prisoners (to which we applied a reasonableness standard in Turner) and incoming correspondence from nonprisoners would likely prove futile, and we do not invite it.  To the extent that Martinez itself suggests such a distinction, we today overrule *414 that case; the Court accomplished much of this step when it decided <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> .  In so doing, we recognize that it might have been possible to apply a reasonableness standard to all incoming materials without overruling Martinez : we instead could have made clear that Martinez does not uniformly require the application of a “least restrictive alternative” analysis.  We choose not to go that route, however, for we prefer the express flexibility of the <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> reasonableness standard.  We adopt the <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> standard in this case with confidence that, as petitioners here have asserted, “a reasonableness standard is not toothless.” Pet. for Cert. 17, n. 10.  IV The Court in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> identified several factors that are relevant to, and that serve to channel, the reasonableness inquiry.  The first <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> factor is multifold: we must determine whether the governmental objective underlying the regulations at issue is legitimate and neutral, and that the regulations are rationally related to that objective.  We agree with the District Court that this requirement has been met. 12 *415 The legitimacy of the Government’s purpose in promulgating these regulations is beyond question.  The regulations are expressly aimed at protecting prison security, a purpose this Court has said is “central to all other corrections goals.” Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S., at 823 .  As to neutrality, “[w]e have found it important to inquire whether prison regulations restricting inmates’ First Amendment rights operated in a neutral fashion, without regard to the content of the expression.” Turner, <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 90</citedDecision> .  The ban on all correspondence between certain classes of inmates at issue in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> clearly met this “neutrality” criterion, as did the restrictions at issue in Pell and Wolfish .  The issue, however, in this case is closer.  On their face, the regulations distinguish between rejection of a publication “solely because its content is religious, philosophical, political, social or sexual, or because its content is unpopular or repugnant” (prohibited) and rejection because the publication is detrimental to security (permitted).  28 CFR §540.71 (b)(1988).  Both determinations turn, to some extent, on content.  But the Court’s reference to “neutrality” in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> was intended to go no further than its requirement in Martinez that “the regulation or practice in question must further an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.” 416 U. S., at 413 .  13 Where, as here, prison administrators draw distinctions between publications solely on the basis of their potential implications for prison security, the regula *416 tions are “neutral” in the technical sense in which we meant and used that term in Turner.  14 We also conclude that the broad discretion accorded prison wardens by the regulations here at issue is rationally related to security interests.  We reach this conclusion for two reasons.  The first has to do with the kind of security risk presented by incoming publications.  This has been explored above in Part III. The District Court properly found that publications can present a security threat, and that a more closely tailored standard “could result in admission of publications which, even if they did not lead directly to violence, would exacerbate tensions and lead indirectly to disorder.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.  Where the regulations at issue concern the entry of materials into the prison, we agree with the District Court that a regulation which gives prison authorities broad discretion is appropriate.

 might facilitate criminal activity.” 28 CFR §§ 540.70 (b), 540.71(b) (1988).  This is the controlling standard.  A publication which fits within one of the “criteria” for exclusion may be rejected, but only if it is determined to meet that standard under the conditions prevailing at the institution *417 at the time.  Indeed, the regulations expressly reject certain shortcuts that would lead to needless exclusions.  See § 540.70(b) (nondelegability of power to reject publications); § 540.71(c) (prohibition against establishing an excluded list of publications).  We agree that it is rational for the Bureau to exclude materials that, although not necessarily “likely” to lead to violence, are determined by the warden to create an intolerable risk of disorder under the conditions of a particular prison at a particular time.  15 A second factor the Court in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> held to be “relevant in determining the reasonableness of a prison restriction ... is whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates.” 482 U. S., at 90.  As has already been made clear in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> and O’Lone , “the right” in question must be viewed sensibly and expansively.  The Court in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> did not require that prisoners be afforded other means of communicating with inmates at other institutions, 482 U. S., at 92, nor did it in O’Lone require that there be alternative means of attending the Jumu’ah religious ceremony, 482 U. S., at 351.  Rather, it held in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> that *418 it was sufficient if other means of expression (not necessarily other means of communicating with inmates in other prisons) remained available, and in O’Lone if prisoners were permitted to participate in other Muslim religious ceremonies.  As the regulations at issue in the present case permit a broad range of publications to be sent, received, and read, this factor is clearly satisfied.  The third factor to be addressed under the <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> analysis is the impact that accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on others (guards and inmates) in the prison.  482 U. S., at 90.  Here, the class of publications to be excluded is limited to those found potentially detrimental to order and security; the likelihood that such material will circulate within the prison raises the prospect of precisely the kind of “ripple effect” with which the Court in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> was concerned.  Where, as here, the right in question “can be exercised only at the cost of significantly less liberty and safety for everyone else, guards and other prisoners alike,” <citedDecision>id., at 92</citedDecision> , the courts should defer to the “informed discretion of corrections officials,” <citedDecision>id., at 90</citedDecision> .  Finally, <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> held: “[T]he existence of obvious, easy alternatives may be evidence that the regulation is not reasonable, but is an ‘exaggerated response’ to prison concerns.  .  .  .  But if an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner’s rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests, a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.” 482 U. S., at 90-91.  We agree with the District Court that these regulations, on their face, are not an “exaggerated response” to the problem at hand: no obvious, easy alternative has been established.  Regarding the all-or-nothing rule, we analyze respondents’ proposed alternatives to that rule as alternative means of accommodating respondents’ asserted rights.  The District Court discussed the evidence and found, on the basis of testimony in the record, that petitioners’ fear that tearing out the *419 rejected portions and admitting the rest of the publication would create more discontent than the current practice was “reasonably founded.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  The Court of Appeals did not contest the District Court’s factual finding as such, but ruled that upholding a practice merely because it is based upon “reasonably founded” fears is improper under Martinez : the Court of Appeals held that this finding “conflicts with the holding of Martinez that prison administrators have the burden of showing that a restrictive practice is ‘generally necessary.’” 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 194, 824 F. 2d, at 1174 .  As we here do not apply the Martinez standard, we reject the Court of Appeals’ sole ground for questioning the District Court’s findings in this respect.  In our view, when prison officials are able to demonstrate that they have rejected a less restrictive alternative because of reasonably founded fears that it will lead to greater harm, they succeed in demonstrating that the alternative they in fact selected was not an “exaggerated response” under <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> .  Furthermore, the administrative inconvenience of this proposed alternative is also a factor to be considered and adds additional support to the District Court’s conclusion that petitioners were not obligated to adopt it.  See Wolfish, 441 U. S., at 549 .  V In sum, we hold that Turner's reasonableness standard is to be applied to the regulations at issue in this case, and that those regulations are facially valid under that standard.  We agree with the remand for an examination of the validity of the regulations as applied to any of the 46 publications introduced at trial as to which there remains a live controversy.  See 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 196, 824 F. 2d, at 1176 .  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
**Lead Opinion**
 The warden or Regional Director is to respond within 15 or 30 days, respectively.  § 542.14.  An adverse decision by the Regional Director may be appealed to the General Counsel of the Bureau; an adverse decision by the warden may be appealed to the Regional Director.  § 542.15.  Although the regulations do not so provide, it is the practice of the Bureau to withhold in its entirety any publication containing excludable *407 material.  This practice, referred to by the parties as the “all-or-nothing rule," is also at issue in this case. We do not think it sufficient to focus, as respondents urge, on the identity of the individuals whose rights allegedly have been infringed.  Although the Court took special note in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396 (1974), of the fact that the rights of nonprisoners were at issue, and stated a rule in Turner v. Safley, <citedDecision>482 U. S. 78</citedDecision> (1987), for circumstances in which “a prison regulation impinges on inmates’ constitutional rights,” id,., at 89 (emphasis added), any attempt to forge separate standards for cases implicating the rights of outsiders is out of step with the intervening decisions in Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817 (1974); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S. 119 (1977); and Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979).  These three cases, on which the Court expressly relied in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> when it announced the reasonableness standard for “inmates’ constitutional rights” cases, all involved regulations that affected rights of prisoners and outsiders.  Pell involved the right of representatives of the news media to conduct interviews in the prisons in order to inform the public about prison conditions.  The asserted right at issue in Jones was the right of a prisoners’ union to send its literature into the prison.  In Wolfish , publishers sought to send hardback books into the prison.  In all these eases, regulations worked a “consequential restriction on the .  .  .  rights of those who are not prisoners.” Martinez, 416 U. S., at 409 .  But the Court in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> observed: “In none of these .  .  .  cases did the Court apply a standard of heightened scrutiny, but instead inquired whether a prison regulation that burdens fundamental rights is ‘reasonably related’ to legitimate penological objectives, or whether it represents an ‘exaggerated response’ to those concerns.” 482 U. S., at 87.  Martinez has been characterized in subsequent decisions of this Court as a case concerning “written communication by inmates” to noninmate recipients.  See Pell, 417 U. S., at 826 .  See also Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 U. S. 1, 12 (1978) (plurality opinion) (distinguishing Martinez as dealing with outsiders' right to receive communications from inside the prison, as opposed to outsiders' right to prison access); id., at 31 (dissenting opinion) (noting Martinez as a case concerning “excessive censorship of outgoing inmate correspondence” (emphasis added)).
**Lead Opinion**
 To be sure, some of the regulations at issue in Martinez applied to incoming, as well as outgoing, correspondence.  In striking down these regulations as facially overbroad, the Court did not limit its holding to restrictions on outgoing correspondence.  But the Court noted that the regulation banning transmission of “inflammatory political, racial, religious or other views” was not “limited to incoming letters.” 416 U. S., at 416 .  This observation suggests that the Court’s approach to the regulation might have been different had the regulation been so limited.  The District Court in the present case stated its standard of review: “the Bureau [must] articulate a relationship between its regulations (and practices) and legitimate penological objectives such as internal security.  Once the Bureau meets that requirement, the plaintiffs must show by ‘substantial evidence’ that the defendants have ‘exaggerated their response’ to the problems the regulations address.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a-47a (citing, among other cases, St. Claire v. Cuyler, 634 F. 2d 109, 114 (CA3 1980)).  The District Court did not have the benefit of this Court’s decision in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> , and the standard of review it applied is not precisely identical to the <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> standard.  In particular, it is by no means certain what the District Court meant by “substantial evidence.” We do not pass on any question of evidentiary burdens or burden shifting here, but we conclude that the standard applied by the District Court is sufficiently close to the <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> standard for present purposes to permit reliance on the District Court’s findings.  Indeed, the Court upheld content distinctions in Jones , where internal distribution of a prisoners’ union’s materials was prohibited while distribution of materials from the Jay cees and Alcoholics Anonymous was permitted.  433 U. S., at 131, n. 8 .  It upheld these distinctions against an equal protection challenge because the distinctions had a rational basis in the legitimate penological interests of the prisons: in contrast with the prisoners’ union, the Jaycees and Alcoholics Anonymous “were seen as serving a rehabilitative purpose, working in harmony with the goals and desires of the prison administrators, and both had been determined not to pose any threat to the order or security of the institution.” Id., at 134 .  In contrast, the censorship at issue in Martinez closely resembled the kind of censorship which is expressly prohibited by the regulations presently at issue.  In Martinez , the regulations barred writings that “unduly complain” or “magnify grievances,” express “inflammatory political, racial, religious or other views,” or are “defamatory” or “otherwise inappropriate.” 416 U. S, at 415.  We found in Martinez that “[t]hese regulations fairly invited prison officials and employees to apply their own personal prejudices and opinions as standards for prisoner mail censorship,” and that the purpose of the regulations had not been found “unrelated to the suppression of expression.” Ibid. The regulations at issue in Martinez , therefore, were decidedly not “neutral” in the relevant sense.  The exercise of discretion called for by these regulations may produce seeming “inconsistencies,” but what may appear to be inconsistent results are not necessarily signs of arbitrariness or irrationality.  Given the likely variability within and between institutions over time, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a; App. 20-21, 50, greater consistency might be attainable only at the cost of a more broadly restrictive rule against admission of incoming publications.  Cf. F. Dostoyevsky, The House of the Dead 40 (Penguin 1985) (prisoners permitted to read only the Bible).  Any attempt to achieve greater consistency by broader exclusions might itself run afoul of the second <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> factor, i.  e., the presence or absence of “alternative means of exercising the right” in question.  482 U. S., at 90.  The regulations at issue here, in our view, strike an acceptable balance.  Respondents have argued that the record does not support the conclusion that exclusions are in fact based on particular events or conditions at a particular prison; they contend that variability in enforcement of the regulations stems solely from the censors’ subjective views.  Brief for Respondents 43-44, n. 37.  These contentions go to the adequacy of the regulations as applied, and will be considered on remand.
**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 Since the risk of improper use by publishers and similar sources was low, the jail delivered books from them but not from other outsiders.  Id., at 549 .  The Court found this explanation acceptable and held that the rule did not violate the detainees’ First Amendment rights.  Id., at 550 .  Although the Court did not expressly address the rights of nonprisoners, the fact that softcover publications were delivered without restriction, see id., at 552 , minimized the abridgment of outsiders’ rights.  The approval in Wolfish of greater protection for publishers than for individual citizens reinforces Martinez’s view that the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners must be carefully weighed and undermines the Court’s approach today.  Most recently, Turner v. Safley, <citedDecision>482 U. S. 78</citedDecision> (1987), confirmed the vitality of Martinez for evaluating encroachments on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners.  The Court relied on the three interim “prisoners’ rights” cases to establish a reasonableness standard for reviewing inmate-to-inmate correspondence.  Id., at 89.  But in its unanimous invalidation of a restriction on inmate marriages, the Court acknowledged that “because the regulation may entail a ‘con *427 sequential restriction on the [constitutional] rights of those who are not prisoners,’” Martinez might posit the correct level of review.  <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 97</citedDecision> (quoting Martinez, 416 U. S., at 409 ).  It did not “reach this question, however, because even under the reasonable relationship test, the marriage regulation does not withstand scrutiny.” 10 " <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 97</citedDecision> .  The <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> opinion cited and quoted from Martinez more than 20 times; not once did it disapprove Martinez's holding, its standard, or its recognition of a special interest in protecting the First Amendment rights of those who are not prisoners.  Notwithstanding, today the Court abandons the premise on which Martinez was grounded.  This casual discarding of “ ‘the secure foundation’ ” of considered precedent ill serves the orderly development of the law. See Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 190-191 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring) (quoting B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921)).  II In lieu of Martinez’s rationale, which properly takes into consideration the effects that prison regulations have on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners, the Court applies a manipulable “reasonableness” standard to a set of regulations that too easily may be interpreted to authorize arbitrary rejections of literature addressed to inmates.  As I pointed out in my partial dissent in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> , an “open-ended ‘reasonableness’ standard makes it much too easy to uphold restrictions on prisoners’ First Amendment rights on the basis of administrative concerns and speculation about possible security risks rather than on the basis of evidence that the restrictions *428 are needed to further an important governmental interest.” <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 101, n. 1</citedDecision> .  To be sure, courts must give prison administrators some berth to combat the “Herculean obstacles” blocking their efforts to maintain security and prevent escapes or other criminal conduct, see Martinez, 416 U. S., at 404 , and I do not object to those regulations clearly targeted at such interests.  11 Nevertheless, I agree with the Court of Appeals that provisions allowing prison officials to reject a publication if they find its contents are “detrimental” to “security, good order, or discipline” or “might facilitate criminal activity” are impermissibly ambiguous.  See Abbott v. Meese, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 193, 824 F. 2d 1166, 1173 (1987).  The term “detrimental” invites so many interpretations that it scarcely checks administrators’ actions.  Similarly, “might facilitate” —in contrast with “encourage” or “advocate” — so attenuates the causal connection between expression and proscribed conduct that the warden has virtually free rein to censor incoming publications.  Despite this vagueness, the Court accepts petitioners’ assertion that they need “broad discretion” to prevent internal disorder, and thus holds that all the regulations are facially valid.
**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 See ante, at 417-418.  No evidence supports the Court’s assumption that, unlike personal letters, these publications will circulate within the prison and cause ripples of disruption.  16 See ante, at 412, 418.  Nor is there any evidence that an incoming publication ever caused a disciplinary or security problem; indeed, some of the rejected publications were delivered to inmates in other prisons without incident.  See App. 60, 99, 116-117.  In sum, the record convinces me that under either the Martinez standard or the more deferential “reasonableness” standard these *431 regulations are an impermissibly exaggerated response to security concerns.  Cf. Turner, <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 89-90</citedDecision> .  m If a prison official deems part of a publication’s content— even just one page of a book — to present an intolerable security risk, the Bureau’s regulations authorize the official to return the entire issue to the publisher.  See 28 CFR § 540.71 (e) (1988).  In their challenge to this all-or-nothing rule, respondents argue that First Amendment interests easily could be accommodated if administrators omitted the objectionable material and forwarded the rest of the publication to the inmate.  The District Court, however, found that “defendants’ fears” that “such censorship would create more discontent than the current practice” were “reasonably founded.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  To the contrary, the Court of Appeals applied the Martinez standard and held that “rejection of the balance is not ‘generally necessary’ to protect the legitimate governmental interest involved in the portion properly rejected.” 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 193-194, 824 F. 2d, at 1173-1174 .  In this Court petitioners argue that on remand the Court of Appeals should conduct “a detailed analysis of the evidence in this case” to determine if the all-or-nothing rule is “reasonable.” Brief for Petitioners 31.

 .” 28 CFR § 540.70 (a) (1988).  “The Warden may reject a publication only if it is determined detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity.” § 540.71(b).  See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, 422 (1974) (Marshall, J., concurring) (“A prisoner does not shed .  .  .  basic First Amendment rights at the prison gate”).  See also Turner v. Safley, <citedDecision>482 U. S. 78, 84</citedDecision> (1987); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 822 (1974); Coffin v. Reichard, 143 F. 2d 443, 445 (CA6 1944) (per curiam).  Suffice it to say that the problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree.  Most require expertise, comprehensive planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government.  For all of those reasons, courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform." Martinez , 416 11.  S., at 404-405.  It is obvious that Martinez calls for less than strict scrutiny, and the Court today correctly rejects petitioners’ argument to the contrary.  Compare ante, at 409-411, with Brief for Petitioners 18-22; Reply Brief for Petitioners 1-10.  See, e. g., Lawson v. Dugger, 840 F. 2d 781 (CA11 1987), reh’g denied, 840 F. 2d 779 (1988) (per curiam), cert. pending, No. 87-1994; Valiant-Bey v. Morris, 829 F. 2d 1441 (CA8 1987); Murphy v.

Seiter, 779 F. 2d 1177 (CA6 1985); Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F. 2d 748 (CA5 1978); Aikens v. Jenkins, 534 F. 2d 751 (CA7 1976); Morgan v. LaVallee, 526 F. 2d 221 (CA2 1975).  See, e. g., Espinoza v. Wilson, 814 F. 2d 1093 (CA6 1987); Travis v. Norris, 805 F. 2d 806 (CA8 1986); Meadows v. Hopkins, 713 F. 2d 206, 211 (CA6 1983); Vodicka v. Phelps, 624 F. 2d 569 (CA5 1980); Carpenter v. South. Dakota, 536 F. 2d 759 (CA8 1976), cert. denied, 31 U. S. 931 (1977).  The Court drew support for this proposition from Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U. S. 665, 684 (1972).  That case, like comparable cases decided after Pelt, arose outside the prison context.  E. g., Herbert v. Lando, 441 U. S. 153, 165 (1979); Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U. S. 547, 565-567 (1978).  Petitioners thus are quite wrong when they contend that <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> mandated that First Amendment challenges to prison regulations always be reviewed only for reasonableness.  See Brief for Petitioners 18.  It is undisputed that a warden may exclude an incoming publication if: “(1) It depicts or describes procedures for the construction or use of weapons, ammunition, bombs or incendiary devices; “(2) It .  .  .  contains blueprints, drawings or similar descriptions of Bureau of Prisons institutions; “(3) It depicts or describes procedures for the brewing of alcoholic beverages, or the manufacture of drugs; [or] “(4) It is written in code. .  .  .” 28 CFR 5 540.71(b) (1988).  Cf. Turner, <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 100</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“How a court describes its standard of review when a prison regulation infringes fundamental constitutional rights often has far less consequence for the inmates than the actual showing that the court demands of the State in order to uphold the regulation”).  While publications like Labyrinth reported on prison conditions and legal matters, other rejected publications discussed or depicted sexual activity, martial arts, and electronics, and advocated homosexual rights, neoNazism, and left-wing politics.  See App. 113-132.  See generally J. L.; Respondents’ Lodging.  Asked in a deposition to describe her method for reviewing publications, the clerk replied: “A.  I have a standard.  “Q.

 It is easier not to bother with cutting out different pieces, is that right?  “A.  Well, I think in dealing with the kind of individual that we deal with here or in any institution, if you start cutting up the magazines, you are going to leave yourself open to all kinds of criticism, remarks and other problems.  So it is best to just return the entire publication to the source and then no other insinuations or remarks can be made concerning us and what we do to individual publications or any magazines that people receive.” App. 100-101.  See also id., at 41, 68.  Thus I must disagree with petitioners’ staunch insistence that the reasonableness standard is not “toothless.” See Brief for Petitioners 27.  As I suggested in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> : “[I]f the standard can be satisfied by nothing more than a ‘logical connection’ between the regulation and any legitimate penological concern perceived by a cautious warden, it is virtually meaningless.  Application of the standard would seem to permit disregard for inmates’ constitutional rights whenever the imagination of the warden produces a plausible security concern and a deferential trial court is able to discern a logical connection between that concern and the challenged regulation.  Indeed, there is a logical connection between prison discipline and the use of bullwhips on prisoners; and security is logically furthered by a total ban on inmate communication, not only with other inmates but also with outsiders who conceivably might be interested in arranging an attack within the prison or an escape from it.” 482 U. S., at 100-101 (concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).
