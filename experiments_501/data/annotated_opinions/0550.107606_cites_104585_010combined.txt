 Reg. v. Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311, 330; Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 599-600 ; Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367, 374 .  Petitioner was confronted by a comprehensive system of federal and state prohibitions against wagering activities; he was required, on pain of criminal prosecution, to provide information which he might reasonably suppose would be available to prosecuting authorities, and which would surely prove a significant “link in a chain” 9 of evidence tending to establish his guilt.  10 Unlike the income tax return *49 in question in United States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259 , every portion of these requirements had the direct and unmistakable consequence of incriminating petitioner; the application of the constitutional privilege to the entire registration procedure was in this instance neither “extreme” nor “extravagant.” See id., at 263 .  It would appear to follow that petitioner’s assertion of the privilege as a defense to this prosecution was entirely proper, and accordingly should have sufficed to prevent his conviction.  Nonetheless, this Court has twice concluded that the privilege against self-incrimination may not appropriately be asserted by those in petitioner’s circumstances.  United States v. Kahriger, supra; Lewis v. United States, supra. We must therefore consider whether those cases have continuing force in light of our more recent decisions.  Moreover, we must also consider the relevance of certain collateral lines of authority; in particular, we must determine whether either the “required records” doctrine, Shapiro v. United States, <citedDecision>335
  
   U.
  
  S. 1</citedDecision> , or restrictions placed upon the use by prosecuting authorities of information obtained as a consequence of the wagering taxes, cf. Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U. S. 52 , should be utilized to preclude assertion of the constitutional privilege in this situation.  To these questions we turn.  *50 III. The Court's opinion in Kahriger suggested that a defendant under indictment for willful failure to register under § 4412 cannot properly challenge the constitutionality under the Fifth Amendment of the registration requirement.  For this point, the Court relied entirely upon Mr. Justice Holmes’ opinion for the Court in United States v. Sullivan, supra. The taxpayer in Sullivan was convicted of willful failure to file an income tax return, despite his contention that the return would have obliged him to admit violations of the National Prohibition Act.  The Court affirmed the conviction, and rejected the taxpayer’s claim of the privilege.  It concluded that most of the return’s questions would not have compelled the taxpayer to make incriminating disclosures, and that it would have been “an extreme if not an extravagant application” of the privilege to permit him to draw within it the entire return.  274 U. S., at 263 .
**Combined Opinion**
 Prospective registrants can reasonably expect that registration and payment of the occupational tax will significantly enhance the likelihood of their prosecution for future acts, and that it will readily provide evidence which will facilitate their convictions.  Indeed, they can reasonably fear that registration, and acquisition of a wagering tax stamp, may serve as decisive evidence that they have in fact subsequently violated state gambling prohibitions.  Compare Ala. Code, Tit. 14, §§ 302 (8)-(10) (1958); Ga. Code Ann. § 26-6413 (Supp. 1967).  Insubstantial claims of the privilege as to entirely prospective acts may certainly be asserted, but such claims are not here, and they need only be considered when a litigant has the temerity to pursue them.  We conclude that nothing in the Court’s opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner’s assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted.  To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.  *55 IY. We must next consider the relevance in this situation of the “required records” doctrine, Shapiro v. United States, <citedDecision>335 U. S. 1</citedDecision> .  It is necessary first to summarize briefly the circumstances in <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> .  Petitioner, a wholesaler of fruit and produce, was obliged by a regulation issued under the authority of the Emergency Price Control Act to keep and “preserve for examination” various records “of the same kind as he has customarily kept....” Maximum Price Regulation 426, § 14, 8 Fed. Reg. 9546 , 9548-9549 (1943).  He was subsequently directed by an administrative subpoena to produce certain of these records before attorneys of the Office of Price Administration.  Petitioner complied, but asserted his constitutional privilege.  In a prosecution for violations of the Price Control Act, petitioner urged that the records had facilitated the collection of evidence against him, and claimed immunity from prosecution under § 202 (g) of the Act, 56 Stat. 30 .  Petitioner was nonetheless convicted, and his conviction was affirmed.  159 E. 2d 890.  On certiorari, this Court held both that § 202 (g) did not confer immunity upon petitioner, and that he could not properly claim the protection of the privilege as to records which he was required by administrative regulation to preserve.  On the second question, the Court relied upon the cases which have held that a custodian of public records may not assert the privilege as to those records, and reiterated a dictum in Wilson v. United States, 221 U. S. 361, 380 , suggesting that “the privilege which exists as to private papers cannot be maintained in relation to ‘records required by law to be kept in order that there may be suitable information of transactions which are the appropriate subjects of governmental regulation and the enforcement of restrictions validly estab- *56 lushed.’ ” 13 <citedDecision>335 U. S., at 33</citedDecision> .  The Court considered that “it cannot be doubted” that the records in question had “public aspects,” and thus held that petitioner, as their custodian, could not properly assert the privilege as to them.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 34</citedDecision> .  We think that neither <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> nor the cases upon which it relied are applicable here.  14 Compare generally Note, Required Information and the Privilege against Self-Incrimination, 65 Col. L. Rev. 681; and McKay, Self-Incrimination and the New Privacy, 1967 Sup. Ct. Rev. 193 , 214r-217.  Moreover, we find it unnecessary for present purposes to pursue in detail the question, left unanswered in Shapiro, of what “limits .  .  .  the Government cannot constitutionally exceed in requiring the keeping of records .  .  .  .” <citedDecision>335 U. S., at 32</citedDecision> .  It is enough that there are significant points of difference between the situations here and in <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> which in this instance preclude, under any formulation, an appropriate application of the “required records” doctrine.  Each of the three principal elements of the doctrine, as it is described in <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> , is absent from this situation.  *57 First, petitioner Marchetti was not, by the provisions now at issue, obliged to keep and preserve records “of the same kind as he has customarily kept”; he was required simply to provide information, unrelated to any records which he may have maintained, about his wagering activities.  This requirement is not significantly different from a demand that he provide oral testimony.  Compare McKay, supra, at 221.  Second, whatever “public aspects” there were to the records at issue in <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> , there are none to the information demanded from Marchetti.  The Government’s anxiety to obtain information known to a private individual does not without more render that information public; if it did, no room would remain for the application of the constitutional privilege.  Nor does it stamp information with a public character that the Government has formalized its demands in the attire of a statute; if this alone were sufficient, the constitutional privilege could be entirely abrogated by any Act of Congress.  Third, the requirements at issue in <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> were imposed in “an essentially non-criminal and regulatory area of inquiry” while those here are directed to a “selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.” Cf. Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70, 79 .  The United States’ principal interest is evidently the collection of revenue, and not the punishment of gamblers, see United States v. Calamaro, 354 U. S. 351, 358 ; but the characteristics of the activities about which information is sought, and the composition of the groups to which inquiries are made, readily distinguish this situation from that in <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> .  There is no need to explore further the elements and limitations of <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> and the cases involving public papers; these points of difference in combination preclude any appropriate application of those cases to the present one.' *58 y. Finally, we have been urged by the United States to permit continued enforcement of the registration and occupational tax provisions, despite the demands of the constitutional privilege, by shielding the privilege’s claimants through the imposition of restrictions upon the use by federal and state authorities of information obtained as a consequence of compliance with the wagering tax requirements.  It is suggested that these restrictions might be similar to those imposed by the Court in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U. S. 52 .  The Constitution of course obliges this Court to give full recognition to the taxing powers and to measures reasonably incidental to.  their exercise.  But we are equally obliged to give full effect to the constitutional restrictions which attend the exercise of those powers.  We do not, as we have said, doubt Congress’ power to tax activities which are, wholly or in part, unlawful.

1 Certiorari was originally granted in Costello v. United States, 383 U. S. 942 , to consider these issues.  Upon Costello’s death, certiorari was granted in the present ease.  385 U. S. 1000 .  Mar-chetti and Costello, with others, were convicted at the same trial of identical offenses, arising from the same series of transactions.  Certiorari both here and in Costello was limited to the following questions: “Do not the federal wagering tax statutes here involved violate the petitioner’s privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment?  Should not this Court, especially in view of its recent decision in Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 382 U. S. 70 (1965), overrule United States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22 (1953), and Lewis v. United States, 348 U. S. 419 (1955)?” After argument, the case was restored to the calendar, and set for reargument at the 1967 Term. 388 U. S. 903 .  Counsel were asked to argue, in addition to the original questions, the following: “(1) What relevance, if any, has the required records doctrine, Shapiro v. United States, <citedDecision>335 U. S. 1</citedDecision> , to the validity under the Fifth Amendment of the registration and special occupational tax requirements of 26 U. S. C. §§4411 , 4412?  (2) Can an obligation to pay the special occupational tax required by 26 U. S. C. § 4411 be satisfied without filing the registration statement provided for by 26 U. S. C. §4412 ?” 2 A July 1963 revision of Form 11-C modified the form of certain of its questions.  The record does not indicate which version of the return was available to petitioner at the time of the omissions for which he was convicted.  The minor verbal variations between the two do not affect the result which we reach today.  3 The Treasury Regulations provide that a stamp, evidencing payment of the occupational tax, may not be issued unless the taxpayer both submits Form 11-C and tenders the full amount of the tax. 26 CFR §44.4901-1 (c).  Accordingly, the Revenue Service has refused to accept the $50 tax unless it is accompanied by the completed registration form; and it has consistently been upheld in that practice.  See United States v. Whiting, 311 F. 2d 191 ; United States v. Mungiole, 233 F. 2d 204 ; Combs v. Snyder, 101 F. Supp. 531 , aff’d, 342 U. S. 939 .

 Ga. Code Ann. §26-6413 (Supp. 1967).  See for a similar rule McClary v. State, supra, n. 7.  11 Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S. 479, 487 .  12 We presume that the Court referred to the following: “[T]here is no compulsory self-crimination in a rule of law which merely requires beforehand a future report on a class of future acts among which a particular one may or may not in future be criminal at the choice of the party reporting.” 8 Wigmore, supra, at 349.  But see Morgan, supra, at 37; and McKay, Self-Incrimination and the New Privacy, 1967 Sup. Ct. Rev. 193 , 221.  13 The Court in fact quoted from the reiteration of the Wilson dictum included in Davis v. United States, 328 U. S. 582, 590 .  14 The United States has urged that this case is not reached by <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> simply because petitioner was required to submit reports, and not to maintain records.  Insofar as this is intended to suggest the the crucial issue respecting the applicability of <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> is the method by which information reaches the Government, we are unable to accept the distinction.  We perceive no meaningful difference between an obligation to maintain records for inspection, and such an obligation supplemented by a requirement that those records be filed periodically with officers of the United States.  We believe, as the United States itself argued in <citedDecision>Shapiro</citedDecision> , that “[regulations permit records to be retained, rather than filed, largely for the convenience of the persons regulated.” Brief for the United States in No. 49, October Term 1947, at 21, n. 7.  15 Section 6107 reads as follows: “In the principal internal revenue office in each internal revenue district there shall be kept, for public inspection, an alphabetical list of the names of all persons who have paid special taxes under subtitle D or E within such district.  Such list shall be prepared and kept pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, and shall contain the time, place, and business for which such special taxes have been paid, and upon application of any prosecuting officer of any State, county, or municipality there shall be furnished to him a certified copy thereof, as of a public record, for which a fee of $1 for each 100 words or fraction thereof in the copy or copies so requested may be charged.” The special taxes to which the section refers include the occupational tax imposed by 26 U. S. C. §4411 .  16 The requirement now embodied in § 6107 was adopted prior to the special occupational tax on wagering, but Congress plainly indicated when it adopted the latter that it understood, and wished, that state prosecuting authorities would be provided fists of those who had paid the wagering tax. See H. R. Rep. No. 586, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 60; S. Rep. No. 781, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 118.  17 The Court required such a showing as part of the restrictions imposed in Murphy, 378 U. S., at 79, n. 18 .  The United States has acknowledged that this would be no less imperative here.  Brief for the United States 24r-25.
