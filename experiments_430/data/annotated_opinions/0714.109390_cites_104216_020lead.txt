 In the present posture of the case the most basic question is whether the respective rights and liabilities of the parties are to be decided under the criteria of the National Labor Relations Act alone, under a First Amendment standard, or under some combination of the two.  It is to that question, accordingly, that we now turn.  *513 It is, of course, a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state.  See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Comm., 412 U. S. 94 .  Thus, while statutory or common law may in some situations extend protection or provide redress against a private corporation or person who seeks to abridge the free expression of others, no such protection or redress is provided by the Constitution itself.  This elementary proposition is little more than a truism.  But even truisms are not always unexceptionably true, and an exception to this one was recognized almost 30 years ago in Marsh v. Alabama, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 501</citedDecision> .  In <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , a Jehovah’s Witness who had distributed literature without a license on a sidewalk in Chickasaw, Ala., was convicted of criminal trespass.  Chickasaw was a so-called company town, wholly owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corp. It was described in the Court’s opinion as follows: “Except for [ownership by a private corporation] it has all the characteristics of any other American town.  The property consists of residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a ‘business block’ on which business places are situated.  A deputy of the Mobile County Sheriff, paid by the company, serves as the town’s policeman.  Merchants and service establishments have rented the stores and business places on the business block and the United States uses one of the places as a post office from which six carriers deliver mail to the people of Chickasaw and the adjacent area.  The town and the surrounding neighborhood, which can not be distinguished from the Gulf property by anyone not familiar with the property lines, are thickly *514 settled, and according to all indications the residents use the business block as their regular shopping center.  To do so, they now, as they have for many years, make use of a company-owned paved street and sidewalk located alongside the store fronts in order to enter and leave the stores and the post office.  Intersecting company-owned roads at each end of the business block lead into a four-lane public highway which runs parallel to the business block at a distance of thirty feet.  There is nothing to stop highway traffic from coming onto the business block and upon arrival a traveler may make free use of the facilities available there.  In short the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the property belongs to a private corporation.” Id,., at 502-503.  The Court pointed out that if the “title” to Chickasaw had “belonged not to a private but to a municipal corporation and had appellant been arrested for violating a municipal ordinance rather than a ruling by those appointed by the corporation to manage a company town it would have been clear that appellant’s conviction must be reversed.” <citedDecision>Id., at 504</citedDecision> .  Concluding that Gulfs “property interests” should not be allowed to lead to a different result in Chickasaw, which did “not function differently from any other town,” <citedDecision>id., at 506-508</citedDecision> , the Court invoked the First and Fourteenth Amendments to reverse the appellant’s conviction.  It was the <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> case that in 1968 provided the foundation for the Court’s decision in Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 .  That case involved peaceful picketing within a large *515 shopping center near Altoona, Pa. One of the tenants of the shopping center was a retail store that employed a wholly nonunion staff.  Members of a local union picketed the store, carrying signs proclaiming that it was nonunion and that its employees were not receiving union wages or other union benefits.  The picketing took place on the shopping center’s property in the immediate vicinity of the store.  A Pennsylvania court issued an injunction that required all picketing to be confined to public areas outside the shopping center, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the issuance of this injunction.  This Court held that the doctrine of the <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> case required reversal of that judgment.  The Court’s opinion pointed out that the First and Fourteenth Amendments would clearly have protected the picketing if it had taken place on a public sidewalk: “It is clear that if the shopping center premises were not privately owned but instead constituted the business area of a municipality, which they to a large extent resemble, petitioners could not be barred from exercising their First Amendment rights there on the sole ground that title to the property was in the municipality.  Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 (1938); Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496 (1939); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413 (1943).  The essence of those opinions is that streets, sidewalks, parks, and other similar public places are so historically associated with the exercise of First Amendment rights that access to them for the purpose of exercising such rights cannot constitutionally be denied broadly and absolutely.” 391 U. S., at 315 .  The Court’s opinion then reviewed the <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> case in detail, emphasized the similarities between the business *516 block in Chickasaw, Ala., and the Logan Valley shopping center, and unambiguously concluded: “The shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent of the business district of Chickasaw involved in Marsh.” 391 U. S., at 318 .  Upon the basis of that conclusion, the Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments required reversal of the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. There were three dissenting opinions in the Logan Valley case, one of them by the author of the Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , Mr. Justice Black. His disagreement with the Court’s reasoning was total: “In affirming petitioners’ contentions the majority opinion relies on <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Alabama, supra,</citedDecision> and holds that respondents’ property has been transformed to some type of public property.  But <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> was never intended to apply to this kind of situation.  <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> dealt with the very special situation of a company-owned town, complete with streets, alleys, sewers, stores, residences, and everything else that goes to make a town.  ... I can find very little resemblance between the shopping center involved in this case and Chickasaw, Alabama.  There are no homes, there is no sewage disposal plant, there is not even a post office on this private property which the Court now considers the equivalent of a ‘town.’ ” 391 U. S., at 330-331 (footnote omitted).  “The question is, Under what circumstances can private property be treated as though it were public?  The answer that <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> gives is when that property has taken on all the attributes of a town, i.  e., ‘residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a “business block” on which business places are situated.’ <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 502</citedDecision> .  I *517 can find nothing in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> which indicates that if one of these features is present, e. g., a business district, this is sufficient for the Court to confiscate a part of an owner’s private property and give its use to people who want to picket on it.” Id., at 332.  “To hold that store owners are compelled by law to supply picketing areas for pickets to drive store customers away is to create a court-made law wholly disregarding the constitutional basis on which private ownership of property rests in this country.  .  .  .” Id., at 332-333.  Four years later the Court had occasion to reconsider the Logan Valley doctrine in Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 .  That case involved a shopping center covering some 50 acres in downtown Portland, Ore. On a November day in 1968 five young people entered the mall of the shopping center and distributed handbills protesting the then ongoing American military operations in Vietnam.  Security guards told them to leave, and they did so, “to avoid arrest.” Id., at 556 .  They subsequently brought suit in a Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The trial court ruled’ in their favor, holding that the distribution of handbills on the shopping center’s property was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment, 446 F. 2d 545 , expressly relying on this Court’s <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> and Logan Valley decisions.  This Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The Court in its Lloyd opinion did not say that it was overruling the Logan Valley decision.  Indeed, a substantial portion of the Court’s opinion in Lloyd was devoted to pointing out the differences between the two cases, noting particularly that, in contrast to the hand-billing in Lloyd, the picketing in Logan Valley had been *518 specifically directed to a store in the shopping center and the pickets had had no other reasonable opportunity to reach their intended audience.  407 U. S., at 561-567.  5 But the fact is that the reasoning of the Court’s opinion in Lloyd cannot be squared with the reasoning of the Court’s opinion in Logan Valley.  It matters not that some Members of the Court may continue to believe that the Logan Valley case was rightly decided.

 .  that the property of a large shopping center is ‘open to the public,’ serves the same purposes as a ‘business district’ of a municipality, and therefore has been dedicated to certain types of public use.  The argument is that such a center has sidewalks, streets, and parking areas which are functionally similar to facilities customarily provided by municipalities.  It is then asserted that all members of the public, whether invited as customers or not, have the same right of free speech as they would have on the similar public facilities in the streets of a city or town.  “The argument reaches too far.  The Constitution by no means requires such an attenuated doctrine of dedication of private property to public use.  The closest decision in theory, <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Alabama, supra,</citedDecision> involved the assumption by a private enterprise of all of the attributes of a state-created municipality and the exercise by that enterprise of semiofficial municipal functions as a delegate of the State.  In effect, thé owner of the company town was performing the full spectrum of municipal powers and stood in the shoes of the State.  In the instant case there is no comparable assumption or exercise of municipal functions or power.” <citedDecision>Id., at 568-569</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  *520 “We hold that there has been no such dedication of Lloyd’s privately owned and operated shopping center to public use as to entitle respondents to exercise therein the asserted First Amendment rights.  .  .  <citedDecision>Id., at 570</citedDecision> .  If a large self-contained shopping center is the functional equivalent of a municipality, as Logan Valley held, then the First and Fourteenth Amendments would not permit control of speech within such a center to depend upon the speech’s content.  8 For while a municipality may constitutionally impose reasonable time, place, and manner regulations on the use of its streets and sidewalks for First Amendment purposes, see Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 ; Poulos v. New Hampshire, 345 U. S. 395 , and may even forbid altogether such use of some of its facilities, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U. S. 39 ; what a municipality may not do under the First and Fourteenth Amendments is to discriminate in the regulation of expression on the basis of the content of that expression, Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205 .  “[A]bove all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 .  9 It conversely follows, therefore, that if the respondents in the Lloyd case did not have a First Amendment right to enter that shopping center to distribute handbills concerning Vietnam, then the pickets in the present case did not have a First Amendment *521 right to enter this shopping center for the purpose of advertising their strike against the Butler Shoe Co. We conclude, in short, that under the present state of the law the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no part to play in a case such as this.  Ill From what has been said it follows that the rights and liabilities of the parties in this case are dependent exclusively upon the National Labor Relations Act.  Under the Act the task of the Board, subject to review by the courts, is to resolve conflicts between § 7 rights and private property rights, “and to seek a proper accommodation between the two.” Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S., at 543.

 S. C. §§ 152 (6) and (7).  The Board has held that a statutory “employer” may violate § 8 (a) (1) with respect to employees other than his own.  See Austin Co., 101 N. L. R. B. 1257, 1258-1259.  See also § 2 (13) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. §152 (13).  Hudgens v. Local 315, Retail, Wholesale & Dept. Store Union, 205 N. L. R. B. 628.  Insofar as the two shopping centers differed as such, the one in Lloyd more closely resembled the business section in Chickasaw, Ala.: “The principal differences between the two centers are that the Lloyd Center is larger than Logan Valley, that Lloyd Center contains more commercial facilities, that Lloyd Center contains a range of professional and nonprofessional services that were not found in Logan Valley, and that Lloyd Center is much more intertwined with public streets than Logan Valley.  Also, as in <citedDecision>Marsh, supra,</citedDecision> Lloyd’s private police are given full police power by the city of Portland, even though they are hired, fired, controlled, and paid by the owners of the Center.  This was not true in Logan Valley.” 407 U. S., at 575 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  See id., at 570 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  This was the entire thrust of Mr. Justice Marshall’s dissenting opinion in the Lloyd case. See id., at 584.  Mr. Justice White clearly recognized this principle in his Logan Valley dissenting opinion.  391 U. S., at 339 .  The Court has in the past held that some expression is not protected “speech” within the meaning of the First Amendment.
