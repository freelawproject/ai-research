 Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 316-317 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  6 *249 By insisting on a doctrinaire notion of “consistency” in the standard applicable to all race-based governmental actions, the Court obscures this essential dichotomy.  III The Court s concept of congruence assumes that there is no significant difference between a decision by the Congress of the United States to adopt an affirmative-action program and such a decision by a State or a municipality.  In my opinion that assumption is untenable.  It ignores important practical and legal differences between federal and state or local decisionmakers.  These differences have been identified repeatedly and consistently both in opinions of the Court and in separate opinions authored by Members of today’s majority.  Thus, in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, <citedDecision>497 U. S. 547</citedDecision> (1990), in which we upheld a federal program designed to foster racial diversity in broadcasting, we identified the special “institu *250 tional competence” of our National Legislature.  <citedDecision>Id., at 563</citedDecision> .  “It is of overriding significance in these cases,” we were careful to emphasize, “that the FCC’s minority ownership programs have been specifically approved — indeed, mandated — by Congress.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> We recalled the several opinions in Fullilove that admonished this Court to “ ‘approach our task with appropriate deference to the Congress, a coequal branch charged by the Constitution with the power to “provide for the .  .  .  general Welfare of the United States” and “to enforce, by appropriate legislation,” the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.’ [Fullilove, 448 U. S.], at 472; see also id., at 491 ; id., at 510 , and 515-516, n. 14 (Powell, J., concurring); id., at 517-520 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).” <citedDecision>497 U. S., at 563</citedDecision> .  We recalled that the opinions of Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell in Fullilove had “explained that deference was appropriate in light of Congress’ institutional competence as the National Legislature, as well as Congress’ powers under the Commerce Clause, the Spending Clause, and the Civil War Amendments.” <citedDecision>497 U. S., at 563</citedDecision> (citations and footnote omitted).  The majority in Metro Broadcasting and the plurality in Fullilove were not alone in relying upon a critical distinction between federal and state programs.  In his separate opinion in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 520-524 (1989), Justice Scalia discussed the basis for this distinction.  He observed that “it is one thing to permit racially based conduct by the Federal Government — whose legislative powers concerning matters of race were explicitly enhanced by the Fourteenth Amendment, see U. S. Const., Arndt.  14, § 5 — and quite another to permit it by the precise entities against whose conduct in matters of race that Amendment was specifically directed, see Arndt.  14, § 1.” Id., at 521-522.  Continuing, Justice Scalia explained why a “sound distinction between federal and state (or local) action based on race rests not only upon the substance of the *251 Civil War Amendments, but upon social reality and governmental theory.” Id., at 522.

 See ante, at 230-231.  It provides not a word of direct explanation for its sudden and enormous departure from *253 the reasoning in past cases. Such silence, however, cannot erase the difference between Congress’ institutional competence and constitutional authority to overcome historic racial subjugation and the States’ lesser power to do so. Presumably, the majority is now satisfied that its theory of “congruence” between the substantive rights provided by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments disposes of the objection based upon divided constitutional powers.  But it is one thing to say (as no one seems to dispute) that the Fifth Amendment encompasses a general guarantee of equal protection as broad as that contained within the Fourteenth Amendment.  It is another thing entirely to say that Congress’ institutional competence and constitutional authority entitles it to no greater deference' when it enacts a program designed to foster equality than the deference due a state legislature.  7 The latter is an extraordinary proposition; and, as the foregoing discussion demonstrates, our precedents have rejected it explicitly and repeatedly.  8 *254 Our opinion in Metro Broadcasting relied on several constitutional provisions to justify the greater deference we owe to Congress when it acts with respect to private individuals.  <citedDecision>497 U. S., at 563</citedDecision> .  In the programs challenged in this case, Congress has acted both with respect to private individuals and, as in Fullilove , with respect to the States themselves.  9 When Congress does this, it draws its power directly from §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  10 That section reads: *255 “The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.” One of the “provisions of this article” that Congress is thus empowered to enforce reads: “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U. S. Const., Arndt.  14, § 1.  The Fourteenth Amendment directly empowers Congress at the same time it expressly limits the States.  11 This is no accident.

 A rule of “congruence” that ignores a purposeful “incongruity” so fundamental to our system of government is unacceptable.  In my judgment, the Court’s novel doctrine of “congruence” is seriously misguided.  Congressional deliberations about a matter as important as affirmative action should be accorded far greater deference than those of a State or municipality.  IV The Court’s concept of stare decisis treats some of the language we have used in explaining our decisions as though it *256 were more important than our actual holdings.  In my opinion that treatment is incorrect.  This is the third time in the Court’s entire history that it has considered the constitutionality of a federal affirmative-action program.  On each of the two prior occasions, the first in 1980, Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448 , and the second in 1990, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, <citedDecision>497 U. S. 547</citedDecision> , the Court upheld the program.  Today the Court explicitly overrules Metro Broadcasting (at least in part), ante, at 227, and undermines Fullilove by recasting the standard on which it rested and by calling even its holding into question, ante, at 235.  By way of explanation, Justice O’Connor advises the federal agencies and private parties that have made countless decisions in reliance on those cases that “we do not depart from the fabric of the law; we restore it.” Ante, at 234.  A skeptical observer might ask whether this pronouncement is a faithful application of the doctrine of stare decisis.  12 A brief comment on each of the two ailing cases may provide the answer.  In the Court’s view, our decision in Metro Broadcasting was inconsistent with the rule announced in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989).  Ante, at 225-226.

 Approximately 98% of STURAA’s funding is allocated to the States.  Brief for Respondents 38, n. 34.  Moreover, under STURAA States are empowered to certify businesses as “disadvantaged” for purposes of receiving subcontracting preferences in both state and federal contracts.  STURAA § 106(c)(4), 101 Stat. 146 .  In this case, Adarand has sued only the federal officials responsible for implementing federal highway contracting policy; it has not directly challenged DBE preferences granted in state contracts funded by STURAA.  It is not entirely clear, then, whether the majority’s “congruence” rationale would apply to federally regulated state contracts, which may conceivably be within the majority’s view of Congress’ § 5 authority even if the federal contracts are not.  See Metro Broadcasting, <citedDecision>497 U. S., at 603-604</citedDecision> (O’Con-nor, J., dissenting).  As I read the majority’s opinion, however, it draws no distinctions between direct federal preferences and federal preferences achieved through subsidies to States.  The extent to which STURAA intertwines elements of direct federal regulations with elements of federal conditions on grants to the States would make such a distinction difficult to sustain.  Because Congress has acted with respect to the States in enacting STURAA, we need not revisit today the difficult question of § 5’s application to pure federal regulation of individuals.  We have read § 5 as a positive grant of authority to Congress, not just to punish violations, but also to define and expand the scope of the Equal Protection Clause.  Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966).  In Katz-enbach, this meant that Congress under §5 could require the States to allow non-English-speaking citizens to vote, even if denying such citizens a vote would not have been an independent violation of § 1.
