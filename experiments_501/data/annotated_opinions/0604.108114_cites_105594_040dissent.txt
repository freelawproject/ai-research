**Dissenting Opinion**
 Here the complainant in the second trial is not the same as in the first even though the State is a party in both cases. Very properly, in criminal cases, finality and conservation of private, public, and judicial resources are lesser values than in civil litigation.  Also, courts that have applied the collateral-estoppel concept to criminal actions would *465 certainly not apply it to both parties, as is true in civil cases, i.  e., here, if Ashe had been convicted at the first trial, presumably no court would then hold that he was thereby foreclosed from litigating the identification issue at the second trial. 2 Perhaps, then, it comes as no surprise to find that the only expressed rationale for the majority’s decision is that Ashe has “run the gantlet” once before.  This is not a doctrine of the law or legal reasoning but a colorful and graphic phrase, which, as used originally in an opinion of the Court written by Me. Justice Black, was intended to mean something entirely different.  The full phrase is “run the gantlet once on that charge .  .  .” (emphasis added); it is to be found in Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 190</citedDecision> (1957), where no question of multiple crimes against multiple victims was involved.  Green, having been found guilty of second-degree murder on a charge of first degree, secured a new trial. This Court held nothing more than that Green, once put in jeopardy — once having “run the gantlet .  .  .  on that charge” — of first degree murder, could not be compelled to defend against that charge again on retrial.  Today’s step in this area of constitutional law ought not be taken on no more basis than casual reliance on the “gantlet” phrase lifted out of the context in which it was originally used.  This is decision by slogan.
