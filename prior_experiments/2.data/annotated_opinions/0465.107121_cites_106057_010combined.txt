348 U.S. 11 , 13-14; Brown v. United States, supra , at 51. [4] Chief Justice Taft said in Cooke v. United States, supra , at 537: "Due process of law, therefore, in the prosecution of contempt, except of that committed in open court, requires that the accused should be advised of the charges and have a reasonable opportunity to meet them by way of defense or explanation. We think this includes the assistance of counsel, if requested, and the right to call witnesses to give testimony, relevant either to the issue of complete exculpation or in extenuation of the offense and in mitigation of the penalty to be imposed." [5] In more than one instance in the Southern District of New York, from which this case comes, witnesses cited for testimonial contempt before the grand jury were given hearings under Rule 42 (b). E. g., United States v. Castaldi, 338 F.2d 883 ; United States v. Tramunti, 343 F.2d 548 ; United States v. Shillitani, 345 F.2d 290 ; United States v. Pappadio, 346 F.2d 5 . There is no indication that this procedure impeded the functioning of the grand jury. [1] Brown v. United States was reaffirmed and followed in Levine v. United States, <targetCase>362 U.S. 610</targetCase> . [2] The proposed amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts, approved on September 22-23, 1965, by the Judicial Conference of the United States, make no changes in Rule 42 (a) or Rule 42 (b). [3] No argumentation or factual data are contained in the Court's opinion today which were not fully revealed in the dissenting opinion in Brown, 359 U. S., at 53-63, passim, and considered by the Court there. Nor is it suggested that the Brown rule has proved to be unclear or difficult of application. The considerations attending the overruling of Brown are quite unlike those involved in the overruling that occurred in Swift & Co., Inc. v. Wickham, ante, p. 111, where the Court changed a procedural rule which it found unworkable in actual practice. [4] 48 Stat. 1070 and 1100, 47 U.S. C .

[9] The record shows that the court was "opened by proclamation." [10] Before imposing sentence, the judge gave petitioner and his counsel still another opportunity to offer any explanation they might have of the petitioner's obduracy: "The Court: I have already made my position perfectly clear, but I will say it again: I have directed you to answer these questions before the grand jury, and I have directed you to answer them here. It is my ruling that you cannot be prosecuted for any answer that you give under the circumstances of this case. Do you still refuse, Mr. Harris? "The Witness: I respectfully refuse to answer on the grounds it would tend to incriminate me. "The Court: Anything further?" [11] See, in addition to Brown v. United States, 359 U.S. 41 , and Levine v. United States, <targetCase>362 U.S. 610</targetCase> : Rogers v. United States, 340 U.S. 367 ; Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361 , 369; Hale v.
