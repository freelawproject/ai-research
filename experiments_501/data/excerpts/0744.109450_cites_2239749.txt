 The prohibition does not extend to nonprescription drugs, but neither is it confined to prescriptions that the pharmacist compounds himself.  Indeed, about 95% of all prescriptions now are filled with dosage forms prepared by the pharmaceutical manufacturer.  7 *753 II This is not the first challenge to the constitutionality of § 54^-524.35 and what is now its third-numbered phrase.  Shortly after the phrase was added to the statute in 1968, 8 a suit seeking to enjoin its operation was instituted by a drug retailing company and one of its pharmacists.  Although the First Amendment was invoked, the challenge appears to have been based primarily on the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In any event, the prohibition on drug price advertising was upheld.  Patterson Drug Co. v. Kingery, <citedDecision>305 F. Supp. 821</citedDecision> (WD Va. 1969).  The three-judge court did find that the dispensation of prescription drugs “affects the public health, safety and welfare.” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 824 — 825.  No appeal was taken.  The present, and second, attack on the statute is one made not by one directly subject to its prohibition, that is, a pharmacist, but by prescription drug consumers who claim that they would greatly benefit if the prohibition were lifted and advertising freely allowed.  The plaintiffs are an individual Virginia resident who suffers from diseases that require her to take prescription drugs on a daily basis, 9 and two nonprofit organizations.  10 Their *754 claim is that the First Amendment entitles the user of prescription drugs to receive information that pharmacists wish to communicate to them through advertising and other promotional means, concerning the prices of such drugs.  Certainly that information may be of value.  Drug prices in Virginia, for both prescription and nonprescription items, strikingly vary from outlet to outlet even within the same locality.  It is stipulated, for example, that in Richmond “the cost of 40 Achromycin tablets ranges from $2.59 to $6.00, a difference of 140% [sic],” and that in the Newport News-Hampton area the cost of tetracycline ranges from $1.20 to $9.00, a difference of 650%.  11 The District Court seized on the identity of the plaintiff-appellees as consumers as a feature distinguishing the *755 present case from Patterson Drug Co. v. <citedDecision>Kingery, supra.</citedDecision> Because the unsuccessful plaintiffs in that earlier case were pharmacists, the court said, “theirs was a prima facie commercial approach,” 373 F. Supp., at 686 .  The present plaintiffs, on the other hand, were asserting an interest in their own health that was “fundamentally deeper than a trade consideration.” Ibid. In the District Court’s view, the expression in Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52 , 54—55 (1942), to the effect that “purely commercial advertising” is not protected had been tempered, by later decisions of this Court, to the point that First Amendment interests in the free flow of price information could be found to outweigh the countervailing interests of the State.  The strength of the interest in the free flow of drug price information was borne out, the court felt, by the fact that three States by court decision had struck down their prohibitions on drug price advertising.  Florida Board of Pharmacy v. Webb’s City, Inc., 219 So. 2d 681 (Fla. 1969); Maryland Board of Pharmacy v. Sav-A-Lot, Inc., 270 Md. 103 , 311 A. 2d 242 (1973); Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy v. Pastor, 441 Pa. 186 , 272 A. 2d 487 (1971).  12 The District Court recognized that this Court had upheld — against federal constitutional challenges other than on First Amendment grounds — state restric *756 tions on the advertisement of prices for optometrists’ services, Head v. New Mexico Board, 374 U. S. 424 (1963), for eyeglass frames, Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483 (1955), and for dentists’ services, Semler v. Dental Examiners, 294 U. S. 608 (1935).  13 The same dangers of abuse and deception were not thought to be present, however, when the advertised commodity was prescribed by a physician for his individual patient and was dispensed by a licensed pharmacist.  The Board failed to justify the statute adequately, and it had to fall.

 § 54-524.53.  Stipulation of Facts ¶ 25, App. 15.  Id., ¶ 18, App. 13.  Theretofore an administrative regulation to the same effect had been outstanding.  The Board, however, in 1967 was advised by the State Attorney General’s office that the regulation was unauthorized.  The challenged phrase was added to the statute the following year.  See Patterson Drug Co. v. Kingery, <citedDecision>305 F. Supp. 821</citedDecision> , 823 n. 1 (WD Va. 1969).  Stipulation of Facts ¶ 3, App. 9.  The organizations are the Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., and the Virginia State AFL-CIO.  Each has a substantial membership (approximately 150,000 and 69,000, respectively) many of whom are users of prescription drugs.  <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> ¶¶1 and 2, App. 9.  The American Association of Retired Persons and the National Retired Teachers Association, also claiming many members who “de *754 pend substantially on prescription drugs for their well-being,” Brief 2, are among those who have filed briefs amici curiae in support of the appellees.  Stipulation of Facts ¶¶22 (b) and (c), App. 14.  The phenomenon of widely varying drug prices is apparently national in scope.  The American Medical Association conducted a survey in Chicago that showed price differentials in that city of up to 1200% for the same amounts of a specific drug.  A study undertaken by the Consumers Union in New York found that prices for the same amount of one drug ranged from 790 to $7.45, and for another from $1.25 to $11.50.  Id., ¶¶22 (d) and (e), App. 14.
