**Dissenting Opinion**
 In agreeing to comply with the requirements of the Social Security Act and HEW regulations, I believe that Illinois has also agreed to subject itself to suit in the federal courts to enforce these obligations.  I recognize, of course, that the Social Security Act does not itself provide for a cause of action to enforce its obligations.  As the Court points out, the only sanction expressly provided in the Act for a participating State’s failure to comply with federal requirements is the cutoff of federal funding by the Secretary of HEW.  Former 42 U. S. C. § 1384 (now 42 U. S. C. § 804 (1970 ed., Supp. II)).  But a cause of action is clearly provided by 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , which in terms authorizes suits to redress deprivations of rights secured by the “laws” of the United States.  And we have already rejected the argument that Congress intended the funding cutoff to be the sole remedy for noncompliance with federal requirements.  In Rosado v. Wyman, <citedDecision>397 U. S. 397, 420-423</citedDecision> (1970), we held that suits in federal court under § 1983 were proper to enforce the provisions of the Social Security Act against participating States.  Mr. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, ex *691 amined the legislative history and found “not the slightest indication” that Congress intended to prohibit suits in federal court to enforce compliance with federal standards.  Id,., at 422.  I believe that Congress also intended the full panoply of traditional judicial remedies to be available to the federal courts in these § 1983 suits.  There is surely no indication of any congressional intent to restrict the courts’ equitable jurisdiction.  Yet the Court has held that “[ujnless a statute in so many words, or by a necessary and inescapable inference, restricts the court’s jurisdiction in equity, the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.” Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U. S. 395, 398 (1946).  “When Congress entrusts to an equity court the enforcement of prohibitions contained in a regulatory enactment, it must be taken to have acted cognizant of the historic power of equity to provide complete relief in light of the statutory purposes.” Mitchell v. DeMario Jewelry, 361 U. S. 288, 291-292 (1960).  In particular, I am firmly convinced that Congress intended the restitution of wrongfully withheld assistance payments to be a remedy available to.the federal courts in these suits.  Benefits under the categorical assistance programs “are a matter of statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them.” Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254, 262 (1970).  Retroactive payment of benefits secures for recipients this entitlement which was withheld in violation of federal law. Equally important, the courts’ power to order retroactive payments is an essential remedy to insure future state compliance with federal requirements.  See Porter v. Warner Holding Co., supra, at 400.  No other remedy can effectively deter States from the strong temptation to cut *692 welfare budgets by circumventing the stringent requirements of federal law. The funding cutoff is a drastic sanction, one which HEW has proved unwilling or unable to employ to compel strict compliance with the Act and regulations.  See <citedDecision>Rosado</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wyman, supra, at 426</citedDecision> (Douglas, J., concurring).  Moreover, the cutoff operates only prospectively; it in no way deters the States from even a flagrant violation of the Act's requirements for as long as HEW does not discover the violation and threaten to take such action.  Absent any remedy which may act with retroactive effect, state welfare officials have everything to gain and nothing to lose by failing to comply with the congressional mandate that assistance be paid with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.  This is not idle speculation without basis in practical experience.  In this very case, for example, Illinois officials have knowingly violated since 1968 federal regulations on the strength of an argument as to its invalidity which even the majority deems unworthy of discussion.  Ante, at 659-660, n. 8.  Without a retroactive-payment remedy, we are indeed faced with “the spectre of a state, perhaps calculatingly, defying federal law and thereby depriving welfare recipients of the financial assistance Congress thought it was giving them.” Jordan v. Weaver, 472 F. 2d 985 , 995 (CA7 1972).

 The regulations *693 which require States to make corrective payments retroactively in the event of a successful fair hearing challenge, 45 CFR § 205.10 (a) (18), merely confirm the obvious statutory intent.  .HEW regulations also authorize federal matching funds for retroactive assistance payments made pursuant to court order, 45 CFR §§ 205.10 (b) (2), (b)(3).  We should not lightly disregard this explicit recognition by the agency charged with administration of the statute that such a remedy was authorized by Congress.  See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, 433-434 (1971).  Illinois chose to participate in the AABD program with its eyes wide open.  Drawn by the lure of federal funds, it voluntarily obligated itself to comply with the Social Security Act and HEW regulations, with full knowledge that Congress had authorized assistance recipients to go into federal court to enforce these obligations and to recover benefits wrongfully denied.  Any doubts on this score must surely have been removed by our decisions in <citedDecision>Rosado</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wyman, supra,</citedDecision> and Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 (1969), where we affirmed a district court retroactive payment order.  I cannot avoid the conclusion that, by virtue of its knowing and voluntary decision to nevertheless participate in the program, the State necessarily consented to subject itself to these suits.  I have no quarrel with the Court’s view that waiver of constitutional rights should not lightly be inferred.  But I simply cannot believe that the State could have entered into this essentially contractual agreement with the Federal Government without recognizing that it was subjecting itself to the full scope of the § 1983 remedy provided by Congress to enforce the terms of the agreement.  Of course, § 1983 suits are nominally brought against state officers, rather than the State itself, and do not *694 ordinarily raise Eleventh Amendment problems in view of this Court’s decision in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908).  But to the extent that the relief authorized by Congress in an action under § 1983 may be open to Eleventh Amendment objections, 2 these objections are waived when the State agrees to comply with federal requirements enforceable in such an action.  I do not find persuasive the Court’s reliance in this case on the fact that “congressional authorization to sue a class of defendants which literally includes States” is absent.
