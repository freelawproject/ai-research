**Lead Opinion**
 This conclusion is consistent with the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit’s earlier decision holding that the Chippewa retained those same rights with respect to the ceded land located in Wisconsin.  Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Voigt, 700 F. 2d 341 , appeal dism’d and cert, denied sub nom. Besadny v. Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, 464 U. S. 805 (1983) (Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens, JJ., would affirm).  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied a petition for rehearing and a suggestion for rehearing en banc.  The State of Minnesota, the landowners, and the counties all filed petitions for writs of certiorari, and we granted the State’s petition.  524 U. S. 915 (1998).  1 — 4 HH We are first asked to decide whether President Taylor’s Executive Order of February 6, 1850, terminated Chippewa hunting, fishing, and gathering rights under the 1837 Treaty.  The Court of Appeals began its analysis of this question with a statement of black letter law: “ ‘The President’s power, if any, to issue the order must stem either from an act of Con *189 gress or from the Constitution itself.’” 124 F. 3d, at 915 (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, <citedDecision>343 U. S. 579, 585</citedDecision> (1952)).  The court considered whether the President had authority to issue the removal order under the 1830 Removal Act (hereinafter Removal Act), 4 Stat. 411 .  The Removal Act authorized the President to convey land west of the Mississippi to Indian tribes that chose to “exchange the lands where they now reside, and remove there.” Id., at 412.  According to the Court of Appeals, the Removal Act only allowed the removal of Indians who had consented to removal.  124 F. 3d, at 915-916.  Because the Chippewa had not consented to removal, according to the court, the Removal Act could not provide authority for the President’s 1850 removal order.  Id., at 916-917.
