**Dissenting Opinion**
6 Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents 222-223. Roche, The Expatriation Cases, 1963 Sup. Ct. Rev. 325, 343. 13 Stat. 490. It was this provision that, after various recodi-fications, was held unconstitutional by this Court in Trop v. Dulles, <targetCase>356 U. S. 86</targetCase>. A majority of the Court did not there hold that the provision was invalid because Congress lacked all power to expatriate an unwilling citizen. In any event, a judgment by this Court 90 years after the Act’s passage can scarcely reduce the Act’s evidentiary value for determining whether Congress understood in 1865, as the Court now intimates that it did, that it lacked such power. 13 Stat. 491. Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 2d Sess., 642-643, 1155-1156.
