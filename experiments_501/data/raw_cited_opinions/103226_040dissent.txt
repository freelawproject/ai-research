<p id="ATF7">dissenting:</p>
<p id="b591-5">I am of opinion that the challenged ordinance is not void on its face; that in principle it does not differ from the Boston ordinance, as applied and upheld by this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice White, in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>167 U. S. 43, affirming the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>162 Mass. 510; 39 N. E. 113, and that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed.</p>
