This constitutes an Implicit Negative Action that effectively overrules Kiefer-Stewart.""

}
```

I arrived at this conclusion because:

1. The Target Case (Nielsen) is extensively discussed throughout the passages, but primarily as precedent to be interpreted and applied.

2. While there is debate between the justices about how to properly interpret Nielsen, particularly regarding its implications for double jeopardy analysis, at no point does the majority opinion take explicit or implicit negative action to overrule Nielsen.

3. The discussions of Nielsen are focused on how to understand and apply its principles, not on rejecting or overruling them.

4. The Court actually relies on Nielsen as valid precedent throughout the various opinions, which is incompatible with overruling it.

5. While the Court does overrule Grady v. Corbin in this case, it carefully distinguishes this from its treatment of Nielsen, which remains valid precedent."
