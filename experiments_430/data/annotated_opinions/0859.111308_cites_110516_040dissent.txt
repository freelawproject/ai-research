**Dissenting Opinion**
 The Court today, in its 5-4 decision, overrules National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), a case in which we held that Congress lacked authority to impose the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act on state and local governments.  Because I believe this decision substantially alters the federal system embodied in the Constitution, I dissent.  I There are, of course, numerous examples over the history of this Court in which prior decisions have been reconsidered and overruled.  There have been few cases, however, in which the principle of stare decisis and the rationale of recent *558 decisions were ignored as abruptly as we now witness.  1 The reasoning of the Court in National League of Cities , and the principle applied there, have been reiterated consistently over the past eight years.  Since its decision in 1976, National League of Cities has been cited and quoted in opinions joined by every Member of the present Court. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., <citedDecision>452 U. S. 264, 287-293</citedDecision> (1981); Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 684-686 (1982); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 764-767 (1982).  Less than three years ago, in Long Island R. Co., supra, a unanimous Court reaffirmed the principles of National League of Cities but found them inapplicable to the regulation of a railroad heavily engaged in interstate commerce.  The Court stated: “The key prong of the National League of Cities test applicable to this case is the third one [repeated and reformulated in Hodel], which examines whether ‘the States’ compliance with the federal law would directly impair their ability “to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.”’” 455 U. S., at 684 .  The Court in that case recognized that the test “may at times be a difficult one,” ibid., but it was considered in that unanimous decision as settled constitutional doctrine.  As recently as June 1, 1982, the five Justices who constitute the majority in these cases also were the majority in FERC v. Mississippi .  In that case, the Court said: “In National League of Cities v. Usery, supra, for example, the Court made clear that the State’s regulation of its relationship with its employees is an ‘undoubted attribute of state sovereignty.’ 426 U. S., at 845 .  Yet, *559 by holding ‘unimpaired’ California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), which upheld a federal labor regulation as applied to state railroad employees, 426 U. S., at 854, n. 18 , National League of Cities acknowledged that not all aspects of a State’s sovereign authority are immune from federal control.” 456 U. S., at 764, n. 28 .  The Court went on to say that ev-en~where the requirements of the National League of Cities standard are met, “‘[t]here are situations in which the nature of the federal interest advanced may be such that it justifies state submission.’” Ibid., quoting <citedDecision>Hodel, supra, at 288, n. 29</citedDecision> .  The joint federal/state system of regulation in FERC was such a “situation,” but there was no hint in the Court’s opinion that National League of Cities — or its basic standard — was subject to the infirmities discovered today.  Although the doctrine is not rigidly applied to constitutional questions, “any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification.” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).  See also Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U. S. 667, 691-692, n. 34 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  In the present cases, the five Justices who compose the majority today participated in National League of Cities and the cases reaffirming it.  2 The stability of judicial decision, and with it respect for the authority of this Court, are not served by the precipitate overruling of multiple precedents that we witness in these cases. 3 Whatever effect the Court’s decision may have in weakening the application of stare decisis, it is likely to be less *560 important than what the Court has done to the Constitution itself.  A unique feature of the United States is the federal system of government guaranteed by the Constitution and implicit in the very name of our country.

 .  whose ultimate purpose is not to create a sacred province of state autonomy, but to ensure that the unique benefits of a federal system .  .  .  not be lost through undue federal interference in certain core state functions.” Id., at 236.  See also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., <citedDecision>452 U. S. 264</citedDecision> (1981).  In overruling National League of Cities , the Court incorrectly characterizes the mode of analysis established therein and developed in subsequent cases. 6 *564 Moreover, the statute at issue in this case, the FLSA, is the identical statute that was at issue in National League of Cities .  Although Justice Blackmun’s concurrence noted that he was “not untroubled by certain possible implications of the Court’s opinion” in National League of Cities , it also stated that “the result with respect to the statute under challenge here [the FLSA] is necessarily correct.” 426 U. S., at 856 (emphasis added).  His opinion for the Court today does not discuss the statute, nor identify any changed circumstances that warrant the conclusion today that National League of Cities is necessarily wrong.  B Today’s opinion does not explain how the States’jrole in the electoral process guarantees that particular exercises, of the Commerce Clause power will not infringe on residual state sovereignty.  7 Members of Congress are elected from the various States, but once in office they are Members of the *565 Federal Government.  8 Although the States participate in the Electoral College, this is hardly a reason to view the President as a representative of the States’ interest against federal encroachment.

 .  .  ”).  Similarly, we have considered whether exempting States from federal regulation would undermine the goals of the federal program.  See Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975).  See also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., <citedDecision>452 U. S. 264, 282</citedDecision> (1981) (national surface mining standards necessary to insure competition among States does not undermine States’ efforts to maintain adequate intrastate standards).  On the other hand, we have also assessed the injury done to the States if forced to comply with federal Commerce Clause enactments.  See National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 846-851 .  In addition, reliance on the Court’s difficulties in the tax immunity field is misplaced.  Although the Court has abandoned the “governmental/proprietary” distinction in this field, see New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), it has not taken the drastic approach of relying solely on the structure of the Federal Government to protect the States’ *564 immunity from taxation.  See Massachusetts v. United States, 485 U. S. 444 (1978).  Thus, faced with an equally difficult problem of defining constitutional boundaries of federal action directly affecting the States, we did not adopt the view many would think naive, that the Federal Government itself will protect whatever rights the States may have.
