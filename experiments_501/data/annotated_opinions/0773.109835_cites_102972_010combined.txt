 [9] The deduction for stevedoring remained in effect until the revision of Rule 193 in 1974.  [10] Seeking to retain their theretofore-enjoyed exemption from the tax, respondents in January 1975 sought from the Superior Court of Thurston County, Wash., a declaratory judgment to the effect that Revised Rule 193D violated both the Commerce Clause and the Import-Export Clause.  They urged that the case was controlled by Puget Sound, which this Court had reaffirmed in Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., 330 U. S. 422, 433 (1947) (together, the Stevedoring Cases ).  Absent a clear invitation from this Court, respondents submitted that the Superior Court could not avoid the force of the Stevedoring Cases, which had never been overruled.  Record 9.  [11] Petitioner replied that this Court had invited rejection *741 of those cases by casting doubt on the Commerce Clause analysis that distinguished between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce.  Id., at 25-37, citing, e. g., Interstate Pipe Line Co. v. Stone, 337 U. S. 662 (1949); Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, <citedDecision>303 U. S. 250</citedDecision> (1938).  Petitioner also argued that the Rule did not violate the Commerce Clause because it taxed only intrastate activity, namely, the loading and unloading of ships, Record 17-20, and because it levied only a nondiscriminatory tax apportioned to the activity within the State.  Id., at 20-22.  The Rule did not impose any "Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports" because it taxed merely the stevedoring services and not the goods themselves, id., at 22-25, citing Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511 (1951).  The Superior Court, however, not surprisingly, considered itself bound by the Stevedoring Cases. It therefore issued a declaratory judgment that Rule 193D was invalid to the extent it related to stevedoring in interstate or foreign commerce.  App. 17-18.  [12] Petitioner appealed to the Washington Court of Appeals.

 It applied the tax to the appellant, a Michigan corporation transporting motor vehicles manufactured outside Mississippi.  After the vehicles were shipped into Mississippi by railroad, the appellant moved them by truck to Mississippi dealers.  This Court assumed that appellant's activity was in interstate commerce.  430 U. S., at 276 n. 4.  The Mississippi tax survived the Commerce Clause attack.  Absolute immunity from state tax did not exist for interstate businesses because it "`"was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business."'" Id., at 288 , quoting <citedDecision>Western Live Stock</citedDecision> v. Bureau of Revenue, <citedDecision>303 U. S., at 254</citedDecision> , and Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U. S. 100, 108 (1975).  The Court therefore specifically overruled Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor, 340 U. S. 602 (1951), where a direct gross-receipts tax on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce had been invalidated.  430 U. S., at 288-289 .  The principles of Complete Auto also lead us now to question the underpinnings of the Stevedoring Cases. First, Puget Sound invalidated the Washington tax on stevedoring activity only because it burdened the privilege of engaging in interstate *746 commerce.  Because Complete Auto permits a State properly to tax the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce, the basis for the holding in Puget Sound is removed completely.  [15] Second, Carter & Weekes supported its reaffirmance of Puget Sound by arguing that a direct privilege tax would threaten multiple burdens on interstate commerce to a greater extent than would taxes on local activity connected to commerce.  But Complete Auto recognized that errors of apportionment that may lead to multiple burdens may be corrected when they occur.

 ." Id., at 775-776 .  Only after concluding that railroad safety was not advanced by the regulations, did the Court invalidate them.  They contravened the Commerce Clause because the burden on interstate commerce outweighed the State's interests.  *748 Although the balancing of safety interests naturally differs from the balancing of state financial needs, Complete Auto recognized that a State has a significant interest in exacting from interstate commerce its fair share of the cost of state government.  430 U. S., at 288 .  Accord, Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U. S., at 108 ; <citedDecision>Western Live Stock</citedDecision> v. Bureau of Revenue, <citedDecision>303 U. S., at 254</citedDecision> .  All tax burdens do not impermissibly impede interstate commerce.  The Commerce Clause balance tips against the tax only when it unfairly burdens commerce by exacting more than a just share from the interstate activity.  Again, then, the analysis of Carter & Weekes must be rejected.  B Respondents' additional arguments do not demonstrate the wisdom of, or need for, preserving the Stevedoring Cases. First, respondents attempt to distinguish so-called movement cases, in which tax immunity has been broad, from nonmovement cases, in which the immunity traditionally has been narrower.  Brief for Respondents 23-28.  Movement cases involve taxation on transport, such as the Texas tax on a natural gas pipeline in Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157 (1954).  Nonmovement cases involve taxation on commerce that does not move goods, such as the New Mexico tax on publishing newspapers and magazines in <citedDecision>Western Live Stock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bureau of Revenue</citedDecision> .  This distinction, however, disregards Complete Auto, a movement case which held that a state privilege tax on the business of moving goods in interstate commerce is not per se unconstitutional.  Second, respondents would distinguish Complete Auto on the ground that it concerned only intrastate commerce, that is, the movement of vehicles from a Mississippi railhead to Mississippi dealers.  Brief for Respondents 26-28.  This purported distinction ignores two facts.  In Complete Auto, we expressly assumed that the activity was interstate, a segment of the movement of vehicles from the out-of-state manufacturer *749 to the in-state dealers.  430 U. S., at 276 n. 4.

 The prohibitive effect of the Clause on state legislation results from the Supremacy Clause and the decisions of this Court. See, e. g., Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1852); Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824).  If Congress prefers less disruption of interstate commerce, it will act.  [18] Consistent with Complete Auto, then, we hold that the Washington business and occupation tax does not violate the *750 Commerce Clause by taxing the interstate commerce activity of stevedoring.  To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co .  stand to the contrary, each is overruled.  C With the distinction between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce thus discarded, the constitutionality under the Commerce Clause of the application of the Washington business and occupation tax to stevedoring depends upon the practical effect of the exaction.  As was recognized in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, <citedDecision>303 U. S. 250</citedDecision> (1938), interstate commerce must bear its fair share of the state tax burden.  The Court repeatedly has sustained taxes that are applied to activity with a substantial nexus with the State, that are fairly apportioned, that do not discriminate against interstate commerce, and that are fairly related to the services provided by the State.  E. g., General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436 (1964); Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959); Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, 335 U. S. 80 (1948); Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435 (1940); see Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., at 279 , and n. 8.  Respondents proved no facts in the Superior Court that, under the above test, would justify invalidation of the Washington tax. The record contains nothing that minimizes the obvious nexus between Washington and respondents; indeed, respondents conduct their entire stevedoring operations within the State.  Nor have respondents successfully attacked the apportionment of the Washington system.  The tax under challenge was levied solely on the value of the loading and unloading that occurred in Washington.  Although the rate of taxation varies with the type of business activity, respondents have not demonstrated how the 1% rate, which applies to them and generally to businesses rendering services, discriminates against interstate commerce.

 In that case the Court sustained an Indiana tax on the gross receipts of a foreign corporation from purchase and resale of timber in Indiana.  The transaction was considered local even though the timber was to be transported, after the resale, to Ohio for creosote treatment by the foreign corporation.  The second case was McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., 309 U. S. 33 (1940).  There a Pennsylvania corporation sold coal to New York City consumers through a city sales office.  Even though the coal was shipped from Pennsylvania, the Court permitted the city to tax the sale because the tax was conditioned on local activity, that is, the delivery of goods within New York upon their purchase in New York for consumption in New York. The third case was Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher, 306 U. S. 167 (1939).  There California was permitted to impose a tax on storage and use with respect to the retention and ownership of goods brought into the State by an interstate railroad for its own use.  The fourth was Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, <citedDecision>303 U. S. 250</citedDecision> (1938).  There the Court upheld a New Mexico privilege tax upon the gross receipts from the sale of advertising.  It concluded that the business was local even though a magazine with interstate circulation and advertising was published.  [15]  That the holding in Spector parallels that in Puget Sound is demonstrated by the authorities relied upon or provided by both cases in the past.  Spector relied on Carter & Weekes, which reaffirmed Puget Sound, and upon Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249 (1946).  340 U. S., at 609.  Freeman, in turn, relied upon Puget Sound, 329 U. S., at 257, and Carter & Weekes relied upon Freeman, 330 U. S., at 433 .
