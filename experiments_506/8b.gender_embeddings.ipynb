As set forth more fully below, the EEOC\\nalleges that Defendant retaliated against Mr. DeLambert and ultimately terminated him from\\nemployment for his opposition to sexual harassment and a hostile work environment in violation\\nof Sections 703(a) and 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-2(a), 2000e-3(a).\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\\nJurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 451, 1331, 1337,\\n1343,1345.\\n2. This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Sections 706(0(1) and (3) of\\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(I) and (3), and\\nSection 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1981(a).\\n3. The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were committed within the\\njurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming.\\nPARTIES\\n4. Plaintiff, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \\\"Commission\\\"), is the\\nagency of the United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and\\nenforcement of Title VII and is expressly authorized to bring this action under Sections 706(0(1)\\nand 707 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1), 2000e-6.\\n5. At all relevant times, Defendant, M & N Equipment, LLC (hereinafter \\\"M & N\\n\\nEquipment\\\" or \\\"Defendant\\\"), has continuously been a Wyoming limited liability corporation\\ndoing business in the State of Wyoming. The principals are Gary Brus and Mick McMurray.\\nDefendant operates an oil field construction business, including delivery of supplies for digging\\nwells and some aspects of constructing the wells.\\n6. At all relevant times, Defendant continuously employed at least fifteen employees.\\n7. At all relevant times, Defendant has continuously been an employer engaged in an\\nindustry affecting commerce within the meaning of Section 701 (b), (g) and (h) of Title VII, 42\\nU.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e(b), (g) and (h).\\nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS\\n8. More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Mr. DeLambert filed\\na charge with the Commission alleging violations of Title VII by Defendant.\\n9.     All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.\\n10.    Mr. DeLambert was employed by Defendant from on or about July 1, 2000, until\\nhe was discharged on March 2, 2001.\\n11.    Throughout the time Mr. DeLambert was employed by Defendant, he worked at\\nDefendant\\u2019s facility located at the Jonah Oil Field site near Pinedale, Wyoming.\\n12.    Until February, 2001, Mr. DeLambert\\u2019s immediate supervisor was Richard Marx.\\n13.    During his employment with Defendant, Mr. DeLambert engaged in protected\\n\\nactivity under Section 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-4(a), by opposing unlawful\\nemployment practices at Defendant\\u2019s Pinedale, Wyoming work site. On or about December 7,\\n2000, Mr. DeLambert accompanied several male co-workers, including Mr. Nicodemus and Mr.\\nSchilling, to meet with Mr. Brus and to complain of sexual harassment of a female coworker by\\ntwo M & N employees, Mr. Winkelman and Mr. Williams. This sexual harassment included, but\\nwas not limited to, such actions as male coworkers exposing their genitals and buttocks to the\\nfemale coworker, telling her \\\"show us your hooters\\\" and attempting to put the female employee\\u2019s\\nhand on a male co-workers genitals. The group complained that they had heard that the harassers\\nwere to be promoted to foreman and they stated that such a move would be a problem because\\nMr. Williams and Mr. Winkelman would retaliate against individuals who complained of\\nmisbehavior.\\n14. After Mr. DeLambert complained about the sexual harassment of a female co-\\nworker, Defendant, acting through its managers and supervisors, retaliatedagainst Mr.\\nDeLambert because of his protected activity. After his complaints regarding sexual harassment,\\nDefendant began to harass Mr. DeLambert by yelling at and verbally abusing him, arbitrarily\\nchanging his work assignments, denying him tools and equipment necessary to perform his\\nduties, and denying his requests for equipment repairs.\\n15.    Karen Stepp, a former M & N employee, reported that, sometime after December\\n8, 2000, Mr. Winkelman told her that DeLambert had \\\"slit his throat\\\" by making his complaint\\n4\\n\\n16. After several employees, including Mr. DeLambert complained about sexual\\nharassment and retaliation by Mr. Winkelman and Mr. Williams, both were promoted to a\\nsupervisory position in February 2001.\\n17.    Defendant took insufficient actions to investigate Mr. DeLambert\\u2019s complaints\\nabout retaliation, and instead, increased the harassment the more he complained. Defendant\\ncontinued to harass Mr. DeLambert by yelling at and verbally abusing him, arbitrarily changing\\nhis work assignments, denying him tools and equipment necessary to perform his duties, and\\ndenying his requests for equipment repairs.\\n18,    The harassment and retaliation culminated on or about March 2,2001, when Mr.\\nDeLambert was discharged.\\n19. The events and employment practices alleged in the foregoing paragraphs\\nconstitute retaliation in violation of Section 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-3(a).\\n20.    As a result of Defendant\\u2019s unlawful retaliation, Mr. DeLambert has suffered\\ndamages, including but not limited to emotional distress, lost earnings and benefits, medical and\\njob search expenses, in amounts subject to proof.\\n21. The unlawful employment practices complained of in the foregoing paragraphs\\nwere intentional, or were committed with reckless disregard for the federally protected rights of\\nMr. DeLambert.\\n\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court:\\nA.

Civil No. 01-815 WJ/KBM\\nLOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION,\\nd/b/a LOCKHEED MARTIN MISSION \\nSYSTEMS,\\nDefendant.\\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\\nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court upon Plaintiff\\u2019s Motion to Strike Affirmative\\nDefenses, filed September 27, 2001 (Doc. 14).  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\\n(\\u201cEEOC\\u201d or the \\u201cCommission\\u201d), on behalf of former employees Janna Roberts and Jeanette Wolf,\\nalleges that Defendant engaged in unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII, 42\\nU.S.C. \\u00a72000e-2(a).   Ms. Roberts and Ms. Wolfe claim that they were subjected to a hostile\\nwork environment when they were victims of both verbal and physical sexual harassment by their\\nimmediate supervisor. Plaintiff moves the Court to strike Defendant\\u2019s Fourteenth (in part) and\\nEighteenth Affirmative Defenses which state, respectively that: Plaintiff\\u2019s complaint is barred by\\nthe doctrines of laches and unclean hands; and that Plaintiff\\u2019s claim for punitive damages is barred\\nby the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.  \\nUnder Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court \\u201cmay order stricken\\n1\\n\\nfrom any pleading any insufficient defense.\\u201d However, motions to strike affirmative defenses are\\ngenerally disfavored.  See Friends of Santa Fe County v. LAC Minerals, Inc., 892 F.Supp. 1333,\\n1343 (D.N.M. 1995) (citations omitted).  To strike a defense, its legal insufficiency must be\\n\\\"clearly apparent.\\\"  Id. (same).  A court \\u201cmust be convinced that there are no questions of fact,\\nthat any questions of law are clear and not in dispute, and that under no set of circumstances\\ncould the defenses succeed.\\\" Id. (same).\\nMs. Roberts filed a charge of discrimination with EEOC in April, 2000.  In April 2001, the\\nEEOC issued an \\u201camended determination\\u201d that discrimination had occurred against Ms. Roberts\\n\\u201cand at least one other female employee in the form of harassment.\\u201d  See Marchbanks Affidavit\\n(Doc. 19).  The federal action was filed on July 13, 2001.  \\nLaches & Unclean Hands\\nAccording to Defendant\\u2019s brief, the basis for the affirmative defenses of laches and\\nunclean hands is that Ms. Wolfe never filed an administrative charge with the EEOC.  In the face\\nof this undisputed fact, Plaintiff contends that Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s failure to file a charge does not bar the\\nCommission from seeking relief on her behalf.  \\nBoth equitable doctrines have been applied as proper defenses to claims of discrimination\\nand retaliatory discharge under Title VII.  See Brown-Mitchell v. Kansas City Power & Light\\nCo., 267 F.3d 825 (8th Cir. 2001) (laches); Lingenfelter v. Keystone  Consolidated Industries,\\nInc., 691 F.2d 339, 340 (7th Cir.1982)(laches); Carpenter v. Ford Motor Company et al, 761\\nF.Supp. 62, 66 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (declining to strike unclean hands where affirmative defense of\\n\\\"unclean hands\\\" was not barred as a matter of law in Title VII action, but striking defense on basis\\nthat allegations of fraud were not pled with sufficient particularity).  There is not much in the way\\n2\\n\\nof the bare chronological facts to support a defense of laches with regard to the timeliness of Ms.\\nRoberts\\u2019 filing, but the same cannot be said at this stage of the litigation regarding Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s\\nfailure to file an administrative charge.  See Bolden v. PRC, Inc., 43 F.3d 545, 552 (10th Cir.\\n1994)(plaintiff in a Title VII claim must exhaust administrative remedies before pursuing judicial\\nremedies).  Plaintiff argues that Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s failure to file a charge with EEOC does not preclude\\nits ability to represent her in this action.\\nThe Commission is entrusted by Congress with broad remedial powers to challenge a\\npolicy that represents ongoing discrimination.  See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a72000e-5; \\u00a72000e-5(f)(1). This\\npower extends to the protection of unnamed individuals where an allegedly discriminatory policy\\nmay affect unidentifiable members of a known class, e.g., persons who have never applied for a\\njob because they were discouraged by a discriminatory practice.  EEOC v. United Parcel Serv.,\\n860 F.2d 372, 374-75 (10th Cir. 1988).  This class by definition would also include persons who\\nhave never filed an administrative charge with the EEOC.  However, application of this broad\\nstatutory directive to the Commission\\u2019s representation of Ms. Wolfe is misdirected because the\\nCommission is not requesting relief that is serving a public interest in freedom from employment\\ndiscrimination, but rather serving to financially compensate Ms. Wolfe.  See EEOC v. North\\nGibson Sch. Corp., 266 F.3d 607, 615, n.7 (7th Cir. 2001) (\\u201cIn cases brought under Title VII and\\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the EEOC also is precluded from seeking monetary relief for\\nindividuals who themselves are barred from bringing the same suit because, in such circumstances,\\nthe EEOC's suit serves only a minimal public interest); (citing EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 193\\nF.3d 805, 812-13 (4th Cir.1999). \\nMoreover, it is not so clear that Defendant was fully aware of the extent and depth of\\n3\\n\\nPlaintiff\\u2019s investigation into Ms. Robert\\u2019s claims so as to put Defendant on notice that the\\nCommission was exploring claims made by Ms. Wolfe as well.  In light of Title VII\\u2019s\\nadministrative exhaustion requirements and the relief which the Commission seeks on her behalf,\\nand because I am unable to conclude that the defenses could not succeed under any circumstance,\\nsee Unger v. US West, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 419, 422 (D.Colo. 1995) (citation omitted), I find that\\nDefendant\\u2019s affirmative defenses of laches and unclean hands should not be stricken.  Whether or\\nnot Rule 12(f) envisions a showing of prejudice by the movant,1 such a requirement would not\\naffect the outcome here.  Plaintiff\\u2019s only asserted basis for prejudice is the unnecessary\\nexpenditure of time and resources on discovery.  Given that discovery is still open, see (Doc. 26),\\nPlaintiff is hardly prejudiced by the inclusion of several discrete issues into the discovery grist mill.\\nPunitive Damages.  \\nBoth parties concede that punitive damages may be available to a Title VII plaintiff. \\nPunitive damages under Title VII and 41 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1981a may be awarded when there is a\\nshowing that the employer intentionally discriminated with malice or reckless indifference to a\\nplaintiff\\u2019s federally protected rights.  See Kolstad v. American Dental Assn., 527 U.S. 526 (1999). \\nThere may also be situations where punitive damage awards may be excessive by constitutional\\nstandards. See, e.g., EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 187 F.3d 1241, 1249 (10th Cir.1999)\\n(punitive damages in ADA claim that was below statutory maximum was \\u201cstrong indicator\\u201d that\\naward was not unconstitutional); Romano v. U-Haul Intenat\\u2019l et al, 233 F.3d 655 (1st Cir. 2000)\\n1  Defendant takes such a position, relying on Sierra Club v. Young Life Campaign, Inc.,\\n2001 WL 1402568 (D.Colo. 2001).  In turn, Plaintiff relies on the lack of Tenth Circuit precedent\\non the issue, and attaches to its Reply an unpublished District of New Mexico opinion which\\nignores the question completely.\\n4\\n\\n(finding punitive damages award in Title VII case constitutionally permissible).  At this point,\\nDefendant is challenging the constitutionality of damages which have not yet been awarded. \\nWhile the defense is premature, I cannot conclude at this stage of the litigation that the defense\\ncould not succeed under any set of circumstances. \\nTHEREFORE,\\nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff\\u2019s Motion to Strike Affirmative Defenses (Doc. 14) is\\nDENIED.\\n                                                                       \\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\\n5\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 240,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['The case \\\"EEOC v.

As set forth more fully below, the EEOC\\\\nalleges that Defendant retaliated against Mr. DeLambert and ultimately terminated him from\\\\nemployment for his opposition to sexual harassment and a hostile work environment in violation\\\\nof Sections 703(a) and 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-2(a), 2000e-3(a). \\\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\\\\nJurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 451, 1331, 1337,\\\\n1343,1345. \\\\n2.

The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were committed within the\\\\njurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. \\\\nPARTIES\\\\n4.  Plaintiff, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \\\"Commission\\\"), is the\\\\nagency of the United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and\\\\nenforcement of Title VII and is expressly authorized to bring this action under Sections 706(0(1)\\\\nand 707 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1), 2000e-6. \\\\n5.  At all relevant times, Defendant, M & N Equipment, LLC (hereinafter \\\"M & N\\\\n\\\\nEquipment\\\" or \\\"Defendant\\\"), has continuously been a Wyoming limited liability corporation\\\\ndoing business in the State of Wyoming.  The principals are Gary Brus and Mick McMurray. \\\\nDefendant operates an oil field construction business, including delivery of supplies for digging\\\\nwells and some aspects of constructing the wells. \\\\n6.  At all relevant times, Defendant continuously employed at least fifteen employees. \\\\n7.  At all relevant times, Defendant has continuously been an employer engaged in an\\\\nindustry affecting commerce within the meaning of Section 701 (b), (g) and (h) of Title VII, 42\\\\nU.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e(b), (g) and (h). \\\\nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS\\\\n8.  More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Mr. DeLambert filed\\\\na charge with the Commission alleging violations of Title VII by Defendant. \\\\n9.      All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled. \\\\n10.     Mr. DeLambert was employed by Defendant from on or about July 1, 2000, until\\\\nhe was discharged on March 2, 2001. \\\\n11.     Throughout the time Mr. DeLambert was employed by Defendant, he worked at\\\\nDefendant\\u2019s facility located at the Jonah Oil Field site near Pinedale, Wyoming. \\\\n12.     Until February, 2001, Mr. DeLambert\\u2019s immediate supervisor was Richard Marx. \\\\n13.     During his employment with Defendant, Mr. DeLambert engaged in protected\\\\n\\\\nactivity under Section 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-4(a), by opposing unlawful\\\\nemployment practices at Defendant\\u2019s Pinedale, Wyoming work site.  On or about December 7,\\\\n2000, Mr. DeLambert accompanied several male co-workers, including Mr. Nicodemus and Mr.\\\\nSchilling, to meet with Mr. Brus and to complain of sexual harassment of a female coworker by\\\\ntwo M & N employees, Mr. Winkelman and Mr. Williams.  This sexual harassment included, but\\\\nwas not limited to, such actions as male coworkers exposing their genitals and buttocks to the\\\\nfemale coworker, telling her \\\"show us your hooters\\\" and attempting to put the female employee\\u2019s\\\\nhand on a male co-workers genitals.  The group complained that they had heard that the harassers\\\\nwere to be promoted to foreman and they stated that such a move would be a problem because\\\\nMr. Williams and Mr. Winkelman would retaliate against individuals who complained of\\\\nmisbehavior. \\\\n14.  After Mr. DeLambert complained about the sexual harassment of a female co-\\\\nworker, Defendant, acting through its managers and supervisors, retaliatedagainst Mr.\\\\nDeLambert because of his protected activity.  After his complaints regarding sexual harassment,\\\\nDefendant began to harass Mr. DeLambert by yelling at and verbally abusing him, arbitrarily\\\\nchanging his work assignments, denying him tools and equipment necessary to perform his\\\\nduties, and denying his requests for equipment repairs. \\\\n15.     Karen Stepp, a former M & N employee, reported that, sometime after December\\\\n8, 2000, Mr. Winkelman told her that DeLambert had \\\"slit his throat\\\" by making his complaint\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n16.  After several employees, including Mr. DeLambert complained about sexual\\\\nharassment and retaliation by Mr. Winkelman and Mr. Williams, both were promoted to a\\\\nsupervisory position in February 2001. \\\\n17.     Defendant took insufficient actions to investigate Mr. DeLambert\\u2019s complaints\\\\nabout retaliation, and instead, increased the harassment the more he complained.  Defendant\\\\ncontinued to harass Mr. DeLambert by yelling at and verbally abusing him, arbitrarily changing\\\\nhis work assignments, denying him tools and equipment necessary to perform his duties, and\\\\ndenying his requests for equipment repairs. \\\\n18,    The harassment and retaliation culminated on or about March 2,2001, when Mr.\\\\nDeLambert was discharged. \\\\n19.  The events and employment practices alleged in the foregoing paragraphs\\\\nconstitute retaliation in violation of Section 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-3(a). \\\\n20.     As a result of Defendant\\u2019s unlawful retaliation, Mr. DeLambert has suffered\\\\ndamages, including but not limited to emotional distress, lost earnings and benefits, medical and\\\\njob search expenses, in amounts subject to proof. \\\\n21.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in the foregoing paragraphs\\\\nwere intentional, or were committed with reckless disregard for the federally protected rights of\\\\nMr. DeLambert. \\\\n\\\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\\\\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court:\\\\nA. Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant, its officers, successors,\\\\nassigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in retaliation\\\\nand any other discriminatory employment practice. \\\\nB. Order Defendant to institute and carry out policies, practices, and\\\\nprograms that proscribe harassment and retaliation against individuals who oppose unlawful\\\\ndiscrimination, and that eradicate the effects of its past and present unlawful employment\\\\npractices. \\\\nC. Order Defendant to make Mr. Clifton DeLambert whole by providing\\\\nappropriate back pay, including all attendant rights and benefits, with prejudgment interest, in\\\\namounts to be determined at trial;\\\\nD. Order Defendant to make Mr. Clinton DeLambert whole, by providing\\\\ncompensatory damages for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful\\\\nemployment practices described herein, in amounts to be determined at trial.\\\\nE. Order Defendant to pay Mr. DeLambert punitive damages, in amounts to\\\\nbe determined at trial, as punishment for Defendant\\u2019s intentional conduct carried out with malice\\\\nor reckless disregard for the federally protected rights of Mr. DeLambert. \\\\nF. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems necessary and\\\\n\\\\nproper in the public interest. \\\\nG.    Award the Commission its costs in pursuing this action. \\\\nDated: September~, 2003                    Respectfully submitted,\\\\nJOSEPH H. MITCHELL\\\\nRegional Attorney\\\\nANCY A.

Civil No. 01-815 WJ/KBM\\\\nLOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION,\\\\nd/b/a LOCKHEED MARTIN MISSION \\\\nSYSTEMS,\\\\nDefendant. \\\\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\\\\nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court upon Plaintiff\\u2019s Motion to Strike Affirmative\\\\nDefenses, filed September 27, 2001 (Doc. 14).   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\\\\n(\\u201cEEOC\\u201d or the \\u201cCommission\\u201d), on behalf of former employees Janna Roberts and Jeanette Wolf,\\\\nalleges that Defendant engaged in unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII, 42\\\\nU.S.C. \\u00a72000e-2(a).    Ms. Roberts and Ms. Wolfe claim that they were subjected to a hostile\\\\nwork environment when they were victims of both verbal and physical sexual harassment by their\\\\nimmediate supervisor.  Plaintiff moves the Court to strike Defendant\\u2019s Fourteenth (in part) and\\\\nEighteenth Affirmative Defenses which state, respectively that: Plaintiff\\u2019s complaint is barred by\\\\nthe doctrines of laches and unclean hands; and that Plaintiff\\u2019s claim for punitive damages is barred\\\\nby the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.   \\\\nUnder Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court \\u201cmay order stricken\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nfrom any pleading any insufficient defense.\\u201d However, motions to strike affirmative defenses are\\\\ngenerally disfavored.   See Friends of Santa Fe County v. LAC Minerals, Inc., 892 F.Supp. 1333,\\\\n1343 (D.N.M. 1995) (citations omitted).   To strike a defense, its legal insufficiency must be\\\\n\\\"clearly apparent.\\\" Id. (same).   A court \\u201cmust be convinced that there are no questions of fact,\\\\nthat any questions of law are clear and not in dispute, and that under no set of circumstances\\\\ncould the defenses succeed.\\\" Id. (same). \\\\nMs. Roberts filed a charge of discrimination with EEOC in April, 2000.   In April 2001, the\\\\nEEOC issued an \\u201camended determination\\u201d that discrimination had occurred against Ms. Roberts\\\\n\\u201cand at least one other female employee in the form of harassment.\\u201d  See Marchbanks Affidavit\\\\n(Doc. 19).   The federal action was filed on July 13, 2001.   \\\\nLaches & Unclean Hands\\\\nAccording to Defendant\\u2019s brief, the basis for the affirmative defenses of laches and\\\\nunclean hands is that Ms. Wolfe never filed an administrative charge with the EEOC.   In the face\\\\nof this undisputed fact, Plaintiff contends that Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s failure to file a charge does not bar the\\\\nCommission from seeking relief on her behalf.   \\\\nBoth equitable doctrines have been applied as proper defenses to claims of discrimination\\\\nand retaliatory discharge under Title VII.   See Brown-Mitchell v. Kansas City Power & Light\\\\nCo., 267 F.3d 825 (8th Cir. 2001) (laches); Lingenfelter v. Keystone  Consolidated Industries,\\\\nInc., 691 F.2d 339, 340 (7th Cir.1982)(laches); Carpenter v. Ford Motor Company et al, 761\\\\nF.Supp. 62, 66 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (declining to strike unclean hands where affirmative defense of\\\\n\\\"unclean hands\\\" was not barred as a matter of law in Title VII action, but striking defense on basis\\\\nthat allegations of fraud were not pled with sufficient particularity).   There is not much in the way\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nof the bare chronological facts to support a defense of laches with regard to the timeliness of Ms.\\\\nRoberts\\u2019 filing, but the same cannot be said at this stage of the litigation regarding Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s\\\\nfailure to file an administrative charge.   See Bolden v. PRC, Inc., 43 F.3d 545, 552 (10th Cir.\\\\n1994)(plaintiff in a Title VII claim must exhaust administrative remedies before pursuing judicial\\\\nremedies).   Plaintiff argues that Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s failure to file a charge with EEOC does not preclude\\\\nits ability to represent her in this action. \\\\nThe Commission is entrusted by Congress with broad remedial powers to challenge a\\\\npolicy that represents ongoing discrimination.   See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a72000e-5; \\u00a72000e-5(f)(1).  This\\\\npower extends to the protection of unnamed individuals where an allegedly discriminatory policy\\\\nmay affect unidentifiable members of a known class, e.g., persons who have never applied for a\\\\njob because they were discouraged by a discriminatory practice.   EEOC v. United Parcel Serv.,\\\\n860 F.2d 372, 374-75 (10th Cir. 1988).   This class by definition would also include persons who\\\\nhave never filed an administrative charge with the EEOC.   However, application of this broad\\\\nstatutory directive to the Commission\\u2019s representation of Ms. Wolfe is misdirected because the\\\\nCommission is not requesting relief that is serving a public interest in freedom from employment\\\\ndiscrimination, but rather serving to financially compensate Ms. Wolfe.   See EEOC v. North\\\\nGibson Sch. Corp., 266 F.3d 607, 615, n.7 (7th Cir. 2001) (\\u201cIn cases brought under Title VII and\\\\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the EEOC also is precluded from seeking monetary relief for\\\\nindividuals who themselves are barred from bringing the same suit because, in such circumstances,\\\\nthe EEOC\\\\'s suit serves only a minimal public interest); (citing EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 193\\\\nF.3d 805, 812-13 (4th Cir.1999).  \\\\nMoreover, it is not so clear that Defendant was fully aware of the extent and depth of\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff\\u2019s investigation into Ms. Robert\\u2019s claims so as to put Defendant on notice that the\\\\nCommission was exploring claims made by Ms. Wolfe as well.   In light of Title VII\\u2019s\\\\nadministrative exhaustion requirements and the relief which the Commission seeks on her behalf,\\\\nand because I am unable to conclude that the defenses could not succeed under any circumstance,\\\\nsee Unger v. US West, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 419, 422 (D.Colo. 1995) (citation omitted), I find that\\\\nDefendant\\u2019s affirmative defenses of laches and unclean hands should not be stricken.   Whether or\\\\nnot Rule 12(f) envisions a showing of prejudice by the movant,1 such a requirement would not\\\\naffect the outcome here.   Plaintiff\\u2019s only asserted basis for prejudice is the unnecessary\\\\nexpenditure of time and resources on discovery.   Given that discovery is still open, see (Doc. 26),\\\\nPlaintiff is hardly prejudiced by the inclusion of several discrete issues into the discovery grist mill. \\\\nPunitive Damages.   \\\\nBoth parties concede that punitive damages may be available to a Title VII plaintiff.  \\\\nPunitive damages under Title VII and 41 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1981a may be awarded when there is a\\\\nshowing that the employer intentionally discriminated with malice or reckless indifference to a\\\\nplaintiff\\u2019s federally protected rights.   See Kolstad v. American Dental Assn., 527 U.S. 526 (1999).  \\\\nThere may also be situations where punitive damage awards may be excessive by constitutional\\\\nstandards.  See, e.g., EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 187 F.3d 1241, 1249 (10th Cir.1999)\\\\n(punitive damages in ADA claim that was below statutory maximum was \\u201cstrong indicator\\u201d that\\\\naward was not unconstitutional); Romano v. U-Haul Intenat\\u2019l et al, 233 F.3d 655 (1st Cir. 2000)\\\\n1  Defendant takes such a position, relying on Sierra Club v. Young Life Campaign, Inc.,\\\\n2001 WL 1402568 (D.Colo. 2001).   In turn, Plaintiff relies on the lack of Tenth Circuit precedent\\\\non the issue, and attaches to its Reply an unpublished District of New Mexico opinion which\\\\nignores the question completely. \\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n(finding punitive damages award in Title VII case constitutionally permissible).   At this point,\\\\nDefendant is challenging the constitutionality of damages which have not yet been awarded.  \\\\nWhile the defense is premature, I cannot conclude at this stage of the litigation that the defense\\\\ncould not succeed under any set of circumstances.  \\\\nTHEREFORE,\\\\nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff\\u2019s Motion to Strike Affirmative Defenses (Doc. 14) is\\\\nDENIED. \\\\n                                                                       \\\\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\\\\n5']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 7,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 60,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24,\n        \"samples\": [\n          11,\n          21,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(df)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Dqu0mTuf9ovK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747090895689,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Jiayi Gao","userId":"10756354987170970544"}},"outputId":"839b3b53-214d-4e4f-9661-899f22b4dd56"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["240"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["MODEL.to('cuda')\n","\n","BATCH_SIZE = 8\n","\n","for index, row in tqdm(df.iterrows(), total=len(df)):\n","    case_id = row[\"case_id\"]\n","    #print(f\"Processing: \", index)\n","\n","    chunks = ast.literal_eval(row[\"chunks\"])\n","\n","    all_embeddings = []\n","\n","    for i in range(0, len(chunks), BATCH_SIZE):\n","        batch = chunks[i:i + BATCH_SIZE]\n","\n","        # Tokenize and move inputs to GPU\n","        inputs = TOKENIZER(batch, max_length=8192, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n","        inputs = {k: v.to('cuda') for k, v in inputs.items()}\n","\n","        # Run model on batch\n","        with torch.no_grad():\n","            outputs = MODEL(**inputs)\n","            last_hidden_state = outputs.last_hidden_state  # shape: [batch, seq_len, hidden_dim]\n","            #print(\"lhs: \", last_hidden_state.shape)\n","\n","            mean_embeddings = last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)  # shape: [batch, hidden_dim]\n","            all_embeddings.append(mean_embeddings.cpu())\n","\n","        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n","\n","    # Combine all embeddings: [n_chunks, hidden_dim]\n","    all_embeddings_tensor = torch.cat(all_embeddings, dim=0)\n","    final_embedding = all_embeddings_tensor.mean(dim=0).numpy()\n","    #print(\"embed: \", final_embedding.shape)\n","\n","    df.at[index, 'mean_embedding'] = final_embedding.astype(object)\n","\n","    torch.cuda.empty_cache()"],"metadata":{"id":"YGJgZfMpgrPJ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"70dcf42a-6fc6-4edd-ccf7-fe4498dd558a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747093802940,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2907247,"user":{"displayName":"Jiayi Gao","userId":"10756354987170970544"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["100%|██████████| 240/240 [48:26<00:00, 12.11s/it]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#df[\"max_embedding\"] = df[\"max_embedding\"].apply(lambda x: x.tolist() if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) else x)\n","df[\"mean_embedding\"] = df[\"mean_embedding\"].apply(lambda x: x.tolist() if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) else x)\n","\n","df.to_json('/content/drive/MyDrive/metadata/embeddings/GENDER_embeddings.json')"],"metadata":{"id":"3sBYm3sR3b8L","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747093803276,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":140,"user":{"displayName":"Jiayi Gao","userId":"10756354987170970544"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"ZQcgupWJWNzl","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":293},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747093803777,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":481,"user":{"displayName":"Jiayi Gao","userId":"10756354987170970544"}},"outputId":"1b0da287-fe3f-4118-c044-4706852ef1ec"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   case_id                                      clean_content  \\\n","0       14  The case \"Rooks & U.S. v.

As set forth more fully below, the EEOC\\nalleges that Defendant retaliated against Mr. DeLambert and ultimately terminated him from\\nemployment for his opposition to sexual harassment and a hostile work environment in violation\\nof Sections 703(a) and 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-2(a), 2000e-3(a).\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\\nJurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 451, 1331, 1337,\\n1343,1345.\\n2. This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Sections 706(0(1) and (3) of\\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(I) and (3), and\\nSection 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1981(a).\\n3. The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were committed within the\\njurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming.\\nPARTIES\\n4. Plaintiff, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \\\"Commission\\\"), is the\\nagency of the United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and\\nenforcement of Title VII and is expressly authorized to bring this action under Sections 706(0(1)\\nand 707 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1), 2000e-6.\\n5. At all relevant times, Defendant, M & N Equipment, LLC (hereinafter \\\"M & N\\n\\nEquipment\\\" or \\\"Defendant\\\"), has continuously been a Wyoming limited liability corporation\\ndoing business in the State of Wyoming. The principals are Gary Brus and Mick McMurray.\\nDefendant operates an oil field construction business, including delivery of supplies for digging\\nwells and some aspects of constructing the wells.\\n6. At all relevant times, Defendant continuously employed at least fifteen employees.\\n7. At all relevant times, Defendant has continuously been an employer engaged in an\\nindustry affecting commerce within the meaning of Section 701 (b), (g) and (h) of Title VII, 42\\nU.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e(b), (g) and (h).\\nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS\\n8. More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Mr. DeLambert filed\\na charge with the Commission alleging violations of Title VII by Defendant.\\n9.     All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.\\n10.    Mr. DeLambert was employed by Defendant from on or about July 1, 2000, until\\nhe was discharged on March 2, 2001.\\n11.    Throughout the time Mr. DeLambert was employed by Defendant, he worked at\\nDefendant\\u2019s facility located at the Jonah Oil Field site near Pinedale, Wyoming.\\n12.    Until February, 2001, Mr. DeLambert\\u2019s immediate supervisor was Richard Marx.\\n13.    During his employment with Defendant, Mr. DeLambert engaged in protected\\n\\nactivity under Section 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-4(a), by opposing unlawful\\nemployment practices at Defendant\\u2019s Pinedale, Wyoming work site. On or about December 7,\\n2000, Mr. DeLambert accompanied several male co-workers, including Mr. Nicodemus and Mr.\\nSchilling, to meet with Mr. Brus and to complain of sexual harassment of a female coworker by\\ntwo M & N employees, Mr. Winkelman and Mr. Williams. This sexual harassment included, but\\nwas not limited to, such actions as male coworkers exposing their genitals and buttocks to the\\nfemale coworker, telling her \\\"show us your hooters\\\" and attempting to put the female employee\\u2019s\\nhand on a male co-workers genitals. The group complained that they had heard that the harassers\\nwere to be promoted to foreman and they stated that such a move would be a problem because\\nMr. Williams and Mr. Winkelman would retaliate against individuals who complained of\\nmisbehavior.\\n14. After Mr. DeLambert complained about the sexual harassment of a female co-\\nworker, Defendant, acting through its managers and supervisors, retaliatedagainst Mr.\\nDeLambert because of his protected activity. After his complaints regarding sexual harassment,\\nDefendant began to harass Mr. DeLambert by yelling at and verbally abusing him, arbitrarily\\nchanging his work assignments, denying him tools and equipment necessary to perform his\\nduties, and denying his requests for equipment repairs.\\n15.    Karen Stepp, a former M & N employee, reported that, sometime after December\\n8, 2000, Mr. Winkelman told her that DeLambert had \\\"slit his throat\\\" by making his complaint\\n4\\n\\n16. After several employees, including Mr. DeLambert complained about sexual\\nharassment and retaliation by Mr. Winkelman and Mr. Williams, both were promoted to a\\nsupervisory position in February 2001.\\n17.    Defendant took insufficient actions to investigate Mr. DeLambert\\u2019s complaints\\nabout retaliation, and instead, increased the harassment the more he complained. Defendant\\ncontinued to harass Mr. DeLambert by yelling at and verbally abusing him, arbitrarily changing\\nhis work assignments, denying him tools and equipment necessary to perform his duties, and\\ndenying his requests for equipment repairs.\\n18,    The harassment and retaliation culminated on or about March 2,2001, when Mr.\\nDeLambert was discharged.\\n19. The events and employment practices alleged in the foregoing paragraphs\\nconstitute retaliation in violation of Section 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-3(a).\\n20.    As a result of Defendant\\u2019s unlawful retaliation, Mr. DeLambert has suffered\\ndamages, including but not limited to emotional distress, lost earnings and benefits, medical and\\njob search expenses, in amounts subject to proof.\\n21. The unlawful employment practices complained of in the foregoing paragraphs\\nwere intentional, or were committed with reckless disregard for the federally protected rights of\\nMr. DeLambert.\\n\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court:\\nA. Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant, its officers, successors,\\nassigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in retaliation\\nand any other discriminatory employment practice.\\nB. Order Defendant to institute and carry out policies, practices, and\\nprograms that proscribe harassment and retaliation against individuals who oppose unlawful\\ndiscrimination, and that eradicate the effects of its past and present unlawful employment\\npractices.\\nC. Order Defendant to make Mr. Clifton DeLambert whole by providing\\nappropriate back pay, including all attendant rights and benefits, with prejudgment interest, in\\namounts to be determined at trial;\\nD. Order Defendant to make Mr. Clinton DeLambert whole, by providing\\ncompensatory damages for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful\\nemployment practices described herein, in amounts to be determined at trial.\\nE. Order Defendant to pay Mr. DeLambert punitive damages, in amounts to\\nbe determined at trial, as punishment for Defendant\\u2019s intentional conduct carried out with malice\\nor reckless disregard for the federally protected rights of Mr. DeLambert.\\nF. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems necessary and\\n\\nproper in the public interest.\\nG.    Award the Commission its costs in pursuing this action.\\nDated: September~, 2003                    Respectfully submitted,\\nJOSEPH H. MITCHELL\\nRegional Attorney\\nANCY A.

Defendants have failed and are continuing to fail to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities \\nAct of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 12101 et seq., and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, by excluding the persons \\nliving at NVMHI, by reason of their disability, from participation in or by denying them the benefits of services, \\nprograms, or activities, or by subjecting them to discrimination, and by failing to administer services, programs, and \\nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. \\nVIOLATIONS ALLEGED \\n26. The acts and omissions alleged in paragraphs 16 through 25 infringe upon the patients' legal rights and \\nsubstantive liberty interests and constitute resistance to their full enjoyment of rights, privileges or immunities \\nsecured or protected by the laws and Constitution of the United States, and deprive NVMHI patients of such rights, \\nprivileges or immunities. \\n27. Unless restrained by this Court, Defendants will continue to engage in the conduct and practices set forth in \\nparagraphs 16 through 25 that deprive NVMHI patients of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by \\nthe laws and Constitution of the United States, and cause irreparable harm to those patients. \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\n28. The Attorney General is authorized under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1997a to seek only equitable relief. \\n\\nWHEREFORE, the United States prays that this Court enter an order permanently enjoining Defendants, their \\nagents, employees, subordinates, successors in office, and all those acting in concert or participation with them from \\ncontinuing the acts, practices and omissions at the institutions set forth in paragraphs 16 through 25, and to require \\nDefendants to take such action as will bring Defendants into compliance with federal law and provide constitutional \\nconditions of care to persons who reside at NVMHI. The United States further prays that this Court grant such other \\nand further equitable relief as it may deem just and proper. \\nRespectfully submitted, \\nJANET RENO, Attorney General of the United States \\nHELEN FAHEY, United States Attorney, Eastern District of Virginia \\nISABELLE KATZ PINZLER, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division \\n_______________________________ \\nSTEVEN H.

Civil No. 01-815 WJ/KBM\\nLOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION,\\nd/b/a LOCKHEED MARTIN MISSION \\nSYSTEMS,\\nDefendant.\\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\\nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court upon Plaintiff\\u2019s Motion to Strike Affirmative\\nDefenses, filed September 27, 2001 (Doc. 14).  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\\n(\\u201cEEOC\\u201d or the \\u201cCommission\\u201d), on behalf of former employees Janna Roberts and Jeanette Wolf,\\nalleges that Defendant engaged in unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII, 42\\nU.S.C. \\u00a72000e-2(a).   Ms. Roberts and Ms. Wolfe claim that they were subjected to a hostile\\nwork environment when they were victims of both verbal and physical sexual harassment by their\\nimmediate supervisor. Plaintiff moves the Court to strike Defendant\\u2019s Fourteenth (in part) and\\nEighteenth Affirmative Defenses which state, respectively that: Plaintiff\\u2019s complaint is barred by\\nthe doctrines of laches and unclean hands; and that Plaintiff\\u2019s claim for punitive damages is barred\\nby the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.  \\nUnder Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court \\u201cmay order stricken\\n1\\n\\nfrom any pleading any insufficient defense.\\u201d However, motions to strike affirmative defenses are\\ngenerally disfavored.  See Friends of Santa Fe County v. LAC Minerals, Inc., 892 F.Supp. 1333,\\n1343 (D.N.M. 1995) (citations omitted).  To strike a defense, its legal insufficiency must be\\n\\\"clearly apparent.\\\"  Id. (same).  A court \\u201cmust be convinced that there are no questions of fact,\\nthat any questions of law are clear and not in dispute, and that under no set of circumstances\\ncould the defenses succeed.\\\" Id. (same).\\nMs. Roberts filed a charge of discrimination with EEOC in April, 2000.  In April 2001, the\\nEEOC issued an \\u201camended determination\\u201d that discrimination had occurred against Ms. Roberts\\n\\u201cand at least one other female employee in the form of harassment.\\u201d  See Marchbanks Affidavit\\n(Doc. 19).  The federal action was filed on July 13, 2001.  \\nLaches & Unclean Hands\\nAccording to Defendant\\u2019s brief, the basis for the affirmative defenses of laches and\\nunclean hands is that Ms. Wolfe never filed an administrative charge with the EEOC.  In the face\\nof this undisputed fact, Plaintiff contends that Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s failure to file a charge does not bar the\\nCommission from seeking relief on her behalf.  \\nBoth equitable doctrines have been applied as proper defenses to claims of discrimination\\nand retaliatory discharge under Title VII.  See Brown-Mitchell v. Kansas City Power & Light\\nCo., 267 F.3d 825 (8th Cir. 2001) (laches); Lingenfelter v. Keystone  Consolidated Industries,\\nInc., 691 F.2d 339, 340 (7th Cir.1982)(laches); Carpenter v. Ford Motor Company et al, 761\\nF.Supp. 62, 66 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (declining to strike unclean hands where affirmative defense of\\n\\\"unclean hands\\\" was not barred as a matter of law in Title VII action, but striking defense on basis\\nthat allegations of fraud were not pled with sufficient particularity).  There is not much in the way\\n2\\n\\nof the bare chronological facts to support a defense of laches with regard to the timeliness of Ms.\\nRoberts\\u2019 filing, but the same cannot be said at this stage of the litigation regarding Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s\\nfailure to file an administrative charge.  See Bolden v. PRC, Inc., 43 F.3d 545, 552 (10th Cir.\\n1994)(plaintiff in a Title VII claim must exhaust administrative remedies before pursuing judicial\\nremedies).  Plaintiff argues that Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s failure to file a charge with EEOC does not preclude\\nits ability to represent her in this action.\\nThe Commission is entrusted by Congress with broad remedial powers to challenge a\\npolicy that represents ongoing discrimination.  See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a72000e-5; \\u00a72000e-5(f)(1). This\\npower extends to the protection of unnamed individuals where an allegedly discriminatory policy\\nmay affect unidentifiable members of a known class, e.g., persons who have never applied for a\\njob because they were discouraged by a discriminatory practice.  EEOC v. United Parcel Serv.,\\n860 F.2d 372, 374-75 (10th Cir. 1988).  This class by definition would also include persons who\\nhave never filed an administrative charge with the EEOC.  However, application of this broad\\nstatutory directive to the Commission\\u2019s representation of Ms. Wolfe is misdirected because the\\nCommission is not requesting relief that is serving a public interest in freedom from employment\\ndiscrimination, but rather serving to financially compensate Ms. Wolfe.  See EEOC v. North\\nGibson Sch. Corp., 266 F.3d 607, 615, n.7 (7th Cir. 2001) (\\u201cIn cases brought under Title VII and\\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the EEOC also is precluded from seeking monetary relief for\\nindividuals who themselves are barred from bringing the same suit because, in such circumstances,\\nthe EEOC's suit serves only a minimal public interest); (citing EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 193\\nF.3d 805, 812-13 (4th Cir.1999). \\nMoreover, it is not so clear that Defendant was fully aware of the extent and depth of\\n3\\n\\nPlaintiff\\u2019s investigation into Ms. Robert\\u2019s claims so as to put Defendant on notice that the\\nCommission was exploring claims made by Ms. Wolfe as well.  In light of Title VII\\u2019s\\nadministrative exhaustion requirements and the relief which the Commission seeks on her behalf,\\nand because I am unable to conclude that the defenses could not succeed under any circumstance,\\nsee Unger v. US West, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 419, 422 (D.Colo. 1995) (citation omitted), I find that\\nDefendant\\u2019s affirmative defenses of laches and unclean hands should not be stricken.  Whether or\\nnot Rule 12(f) envisions a showing of prejudice by the movant,1 such a requirement would not\\naffect the outcome here.  Plaintiff\\u2019s only asserted basis for prejudice is the unnecessary\\nexpenditure of time and resources on discovery.  Given that discovery is still open, see (Doc. 26),\\nPlaintiff is hardly prejudiced by the inclusion of several discrete issues into the discovery grist mill.\\nPunitive Damages.  \\nBoth parties concede that punitive damages may be available to a Title VII plaintiff. \\nPunitive damages under Title VII and 41 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1981a may be awarded when there is a\\nshowing that the employer intentionally discriminated with malice or reckless indifference to a\\nplaintiff\\u2019s federally protected rights.  See Kolstad v. American Dental Assn., 527 U.S. 526 (1999). \\nThere may also be situations where punitive damage awards may be excessive by constitutional\\nstandards. See, e.g., EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 187 F.3d 1241, 1249 (10th Cir.1999)\\n(punitive damages in ADA claim that was below statutory maximum was \\u201cstrong indicator\\u201d that\\naward was not unconstitutional); Romano v. U-Haul Intenat\\u2019l et al, 233 F.3d 655 (1st Cir. 2000)\\n1  Defendant takes such a position, relying on Sierra Club v. Young Life Campaign, Inc.,\\n2001 WL 1402568 (D.Colo. 2001).  In turn, Plaintiff relies on the lack of Tenth Circuit precedent\\non the issue, and attaches to its Reply an unpublished District of New Mexico opinion which\\nignores the question completely.\\n4\\n\\n(finding punitive damages award in Title VII case constitutionally permissible).  At this point,\\nDefendant is challenging the constitutionality of damages which have not yet been awarded. \\nWhile the defense is premature, I cannot conclude at this stage of the litigation that the defense\\ncould not succeed under any set of circumstances. \\nTHEREFORE,\\nIT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff\\u2019s Motion to Strike Affirmative Defenses (Doc. 14) is\\nDENIED.\\n                                                                       \\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\\n5\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 240,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['The case \\\"EEOC v.

As set forth more fully below, the EEOC\\\\nalleges that Defendant retaliated against Mr. DeLambert and ultimately terminated him from\\\\nemployment for his opposition to sexual harassment and a hostile work environment in violation\\\\nof Sections 703(a) and 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-2(a), 2000e-3(a). \\\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\\\\nJurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 451, 1331, 1337,\\\\n1343,1345. \\\\n2.  This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Sections 706(0(1) and (3) of\\\\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(I) and (3), and\\\\nSection 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1981(a). \\\\n3.  The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were committed within the\\\\njurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. \\\\nPARTIES\\\\n4.  Plaintiff, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \\\"Commission\\\"), is the\\\\nagency of the United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and\\\\nenforcement of Title VII and is expressly authorized to bring this action under Sections 706(0(1)\\\\nand 707 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1), 2000e-6. \\\\n5.  At all relevant times, Defendant, M & N Equipment, LLC (hereinafter \\\"M & N\\\\n\\\\nEquipment\\\" or \\\"Defendant\\\"), has continuously been a Wyoming limited liability corporation\\\\ndoing business in the State of Wyoming.  The principals are Gary Brus and Mick McMurray. \\\\nDefendant operates an oil field construction business, including delivery of supplies for digging\\\\nwells and some aspects of constructing the wells. \\\\n6.  At all relevant times, Defendant continuously employed at least fifteen employees. \\\\n7.  At all relevant times, Defendant has continuously been an employer engaged in an\\\\nindustry affecting commerce within the meaning of Section 701 (b), (g) and (h) of Title VII, 42\\\\nU.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e(b), (g) and (h). \\\\nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS\\\\n8.  More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Mr. DeLambert filed\\\\na charge with the Commission alleging violations of Title VII by Defendant. \\\\n9.      All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled. \\\\n10.     Mr. DeLambert was employed by Defendant from on or about July 1, 2000, until\\\\nhe was discharged on March 2, 2001. \\\\n11.     Throughout the time Mr. DeLambert was employed by Defendant, he worked at\\\\nDefendant\\u2019s facility located at the Jonah Oil Field site near Pinedale, Wyoming. \\\\n12.     Until February, 2001, Mr. DeLambert\\u2019s immediate supervisor was Richard Marx. \\\\n13.     During his employment with Defendant, Mr. DeLambert engaged in protected\\\\n\\\\nactivity under Section 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-4(a), by opposing unlawful\\\\nemployment practices at Defendant\\u2019s Pinedale, Wyoming work site.  On or about December 7,\\\\n2000, Mr. DeLambert accompanied several male co-workers, including Mr. Nicodemus and Mr.\\\\nSchilling, to meet with Mr. Brus and to complain of sexual harassment of a female coworker by\\\\ntwo M & N employees, Mr. Winkelman and Mr. Williams.  This sexual harassment included, but\\\\nwas not limited to, such actions as male coworkers exposing their genitals and buttocks to the\\\\nfemale coworker, telling her \\\"show us your hooters\\\" and attempting to put the female employee\\u2019s\\\\nhand on a male co-workers genitals.  The group complained that they had heard that the harassers\\\\nwere to be promoted to foreman and they stated that such a move would be a problem because\\\\nMr. Williams and Mr. Winkelman would retaliate against individuals who complained of\\\\nmisbehavior. \\\\n14.  After Mr. DeLambert complained about the sexual harassment of a female co-\\\\nworker, Defendant, acting through its managers and supervisors, retaliatedagainst Mr.\\\\nDeLambert because of his protected activity.  After his complaints regarding sexual harassment,\\\\nDefendant began to harass Mr. DeLambert by yelling at and verbally abusing him, arbitrarily\\\\nchanging his work assignments, denying him tools and equipment necessary to perform his\\\\nduties, and denying his requests for equipment repairs. \\\\n15.     Karen Stepp, a former M & N employee, reported that, sometime after December\\\\n8, 2000, Mr. Winkelman told her that DeLambert had \\\"slit his throat\\\" by making his complaint\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n16.  After several employees, including Mr. DeLambert complained about sexual\\\\nharassment and retaliation by Mr. Winkelman and Mr. Williams, both were promoted to a\\\\nsupervisory position in February 2001. \\\\n17.     Defendant took insufficient actions to investigate Mr. DeLambert\\u2019s complaints\\\\nabout retaliation, and instead, increased the harassment the more he complained.  Defendant\\\\ncontinued to harass Mr. DeLambert by yelling at and verbally abusing him, arbitrarily changing\\\\nhis work assignments, denying him tools and equipment necessary to perform his duties, and\\\\ndenying his requests for equipment repairs. \\\\n18,    The harassment and retaliation culminated on or about March 2,2001, when Mr.\\\\nDeLambert was discharged. \\\\n19.  The events and employment practices alleged in the foregoing paragraphs\\\\nconstitute retaliation in violation of Section 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-3(a). \\\\n20.     As a result of Defendant\\u2019s unlawful retaliation, Mr. DeLambert has suffered\\\\ndamages, including but not limited to emotional distress, lost earnings and benefits, medical and\\\\njob search expenses, in amounts subject to proof. \\\\n21.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in the foregoing paragraphs\\\\nwere intentional, or were committed with reckless disregard for the federally protected rights of\\\\nMr. DeLambert. \\\\n\\\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\\\\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court:\\\\nA. Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant, its officers, successors,\\\\nassigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in retaliation\\\\nand any other discriminatory employment practice. \\\\nB. Order Defendant to institute and carry out policies, practices, and\\\\nprograms that proscribe harassment and retaliation against individuals who oppose unlawful\\\\ndiscrimination, and that eradicate the effects of its past and present unlawful employment\\\\npractices. \\\\nC. Order Defendant to make Mr. Clifton DeLambert whole by providing\\\\nappropriate back pay, including all attendant rights and benefits, with prejudgment interest, in\\\\namounts to be determined at trial;\\\\nD. Order Defendant to make Mr. Clinton DeLambert whole, by providing\\\\ncompensatory damages for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful\\\\nemployment practices described herein, in amounts to be determined at trial.\\\\nE. Order Defendant to pay Mr. DeLambert punitive damages, in amounts to\\\\nbe determined at trial, as punishment for Defendant\\u2019s intentional conduct carried out with malice\\\\nor reckless disregard for the federally protected rights of Mr. DeLambert. \\\\nF.

Defendants have failed and are continuing to fail to provide reasonably safe conditions and to ensure the \\\\nreasonable safety of the NVMHI patients.  \\\\n17.  Defendants have failed and are continuing to fail to provide adequate medical and mental health care to patients.  \\\\n18.

The acts and omissions alleged in paragraphs 16 through 25 infringe upon the patients\\\\' legal rights and \\\\nsubstantive liberty interests and constitute resistance to their full enjoyment of rights, privileges or immunities \\\\nsecured or protected by the laws and Constitution of the United States, and deprive NVMHI patients of such rights, \\\\nprivileges or immunities.  \\\\n27.

The Commission alleges that Janna Roberts and Jeanette \\\\nWolfe were subjected to a hostile work environment when tbey were victims of both verbal and \\\\nphysical sexual harassment by tbeir immediate supervisor.   The Commission also alleges Jeanette \\\\nWolfe was subjected to harassment based upon her gender and that she was forced to resign as a \\\\nresult of Lockheed\\\\'s failure to effectively remedy her work environment.  \\\\n\\\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \\\\n1.   Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7451, 1331, 1337, \\\\n1343 and 1345.

The Plaintiff, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \\\"Commission \\\"), \\\\nis an agency of the United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and \\\\nenforcement of Title VII and is expressly authorized to bring this action by Section 706(t)(1) and \\\\n(3) ofTitle VII, 42 US.C.  \\u00a72000e-5(t)(I) and (3).  \\\\n4.   At all relevant times, Defendant Lockheed Martin Corporation was a Maryland \\\\ncorporation, which continuously did and is now doing business in the State of New Mexico and \\\\nthe metropolitan Albuquerque, New Mexico area as Lockheed Martin Mission Systems.   At all \\\\nrelevant times, Defendant has continuously had at least fifteen employees.  \\\\n5.   At all relevant times, the Defendant has continuously been and is now an employer \\\\nengaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of Section 701 (b), (g) and (h) of \\\\nTitle VII, 42 US.C.  \\u00a72000e-(b), (g) and (h).  \\\\nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \\\\n6.   More than thirty days prior to the institution ofthis lawsuit, Janna Roberts filed a \\\\ncharge with the  Commission alleging  violations  of Title VII by  Defendant.

The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraph 7 above were done \\\\nwith malice and/or reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of Janna Roberts and \\\\nJeanette Wolfe.  \\\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\\\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: \\\\nA.  Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant, its officers, successors, assigns \\\\n3 \\\\n\\\\nand all persons in active concert or participation with it,  from engaging in any employment \\\\npractice which discriminates on the basis of sex or gender, including sexual harassment and/or \\\\ngender harassment or discrimination.  \\\\nB.

Civil No. 01-815 WJ/KBM\\\\nLOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION,\\\\nd/b/a LOCKHEED MARTIN MISSION \\\\nSYSTEMS,\\\\nDefendant. \\\\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\\\\nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court upon Plaintiff\\u2019s Motion to Strike Affirmative\\\\nDefenses, filed September 27, 2001 (Doc. 14).   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\\\\n(\\u201cEEOC\\u201d or the \\u201cCommission\\u201d), on behalf of former employees Janna Roberts and Jeanette Wolf,\\\\nalleges that Defendant engaged in unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII, 42\\\\nU.S.C. \\u00a72000e-2(a).    Ms. Roberts and Ms. Wolfe claim that they were subjected to a hostile\\\\nwork environment when they were victims of both verbal and physical sexual harassment by their\\\\nimmediate supervisor.  Plaintiff moves the Court to strike Defendant\\u2019s Fourteenth (in part) and\\\\nEighteenth Affirmative Defenses which state, respectively that: Plaintiff\\u2019s complaint is barred by\\\\nthe doctrines of laches and unclean hands; and that Plaintiff\\u2019s claim for punitive damages is barred\\\\nby the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.   \\\\nUnder Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court \\u201cmay order stricken\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nfrom any pleading any insufficient defense.\\u201d However, motions to strike affirmative defenses are\\\\ngenerally disfavored.   See Friends of Santa Fe County v. LAC Minerals, Inc., 892 F.Supp. 1333,\\\\n1343 (D.N.M. 1995) (citations omitted).   To strike a defense, its legal insufficiency must be\\\\n\\\"clearly apparent.\\\" Id. (same).   A court \\u201cmust be convinced that there are no questions of fact,\\\\nthat any questions of law are clear and not in dispute, and that under no set of circumstances\\\\ncould the defenses succeed.\\\" Id. (same). \\\\nMs. Roberts filed a charge of discrimination with EEOC in April, 2000.   In April 2001, the\\\\nEEOC issued an \\u201camended determination\\u201d that discrimination had occurred against Ms. Roberts\\\\n\\u201cand at least one other female employee in the form of harassment.\\u201d  See Marchbanks Affidavit\\\\n(Doc. 19).   The federal action was filed on July 13, 2001.   \\\\nLaches & Unclean Hands\\\\nAccording to Defendant\\u2019s brief, the basis for the affirmative defenses of laches and\\\\nunclean hands is that Ms. Wolfe never filed an administrative charge with the EEOC.   In the face\\\\nof this undisputed fact, Plaintiff contends that Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s failure to file a charge does not bar the\\\\nCommission from seeking relief on her behalf.   \\\\nBoth equitable doctrines have been applied as proper defenses to claims of discrimination\\\\nand retaliatory discharge under Title VII.   See Brown-Mitchell v. Kansas City Power & Light\\\\nCo., 267 F.3d 825 (8th Cir. 2001) (laches); Lingenfelter v. Keystone  Consolidated Industries,\\\\nInc., 691 F.2d 339, 340 (7th Cir.1982)(laches); Carpenter v. Ford Motor Company et al, 761\\\\nF.Supp. 62, 66 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (declining to strike unclean hands where affirmative defense of\\\\n\\\"unclean hands\\\" was not barred as a matter of law in Title VII action, but striking defense on basis\\\\nthat allegations of fraud were not pled with sufficient particularity).   There is not much in the way\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nof the bare chronological facts to support a defense of laches with regard to the timeliness of Ms.\\\\nRoberts\\u2019 filing, but the same cannot be said at this stage of the litigation regarding Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s\\\\nfailure to file an administrative charge.   See Bolden v. PRC, Inc., 43 F.3d 545, 552 (10th Cir.\\\\n1994)(plaintiff in a Title VII claim must exhaust administrative remedies before pursuing judicial\\\\nremedies).   Plaintiff argues that Ms. Wolfe\\u2019s failure to file a charge with EEOC does not preclude\\\\nits ability to represent her in this action. \\\\nThe Commission is entrusted by Congress with broad remedial powers to challenge a\\\\npolicy that represents ongoing discrimination.   See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a72000e-5; \\u00a72000e-5(f)(1).  This\\\\npower extends to the protection of unnamed individuals where an allegedly discriminatory policy\\\\nmay affect unidentifiable members of a known class, e.g., persons who have never applied for a\\\\njob because they were discouraged by a discriminatory practice.   EEOC v. United Parcel Serv.,\\\\n860 F.2d 372, 374-75 (10th Cir. 1988).   This class by definition would also include persons who\\\\nhave never filed an administrative charge with the EEOC.   However, application of this broad\\\\nstatutory directive to the Commission\\u2019s representation of Ms. Wolfe is misdirected because the\\\\nCommission is not requesting relief that is serving a public interest in freedom from employment\\\\ndiscrimination, but rather serving to financially compensate Ms. Wolfe.   See EEOC v. North\\\\nGibson Sch. Corp., 266 F.3d 607, 615, n.7 (7th Cir. 2001) (\\u201cIn cases brought under Title VII and\\\\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the EEOC also is precluded from seeking monetary relief for\\\\nindividuals who themselves are barred from bringing the same suit because, in such circumstances,\\\\nthe EEOC\\\\'s suit serves only a minimal public interest); (citing EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 193\\\\nF.3d 805, 812-13 (4th Cir.1999).  \\\\nMoreover, it is not so clear that Defendant was fully aware of the extent and depth of\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nPlaintiff\\u2019s investigation into Ms. Robert\\u2019s claims so as to put Defendant on notice that the\\\\nCommission was exploring claims made by Ms. Wolfe as well.   In light of Title VII\\u2019s\\\\nadministrative exhaustion requirements and the relief which the Commission seeks on her behalf,\\\\nand because I am unable to conclude that the defenses could not succeed under any circumstance,\\\\nsee Unger v. US West, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 419, 422 (D.Colo. 1995) (citation omitted), I find that\\\\nDefendant\\u2019s affirmative defenses of laches and unclean hands should not be stricken.   Whether or\\\\nnot Rule 12(f) envisions a showing of prejudice by the movant,1 such a requirement would not\\\\naffect the outcome here.   Plaintiff\\u2019s only asserted basis for prejudice is the unnecessary\\\\nexpenditure of time and resources on discovery.   Given that discovery is still open, see (Doc. 26),\\\\nPlaintiff is hardly prejudiced by the inclusion of several discrete issues into the discovery grist mill. \\\\nPunitive Damages.   \\\\nBoth parties concede that punitive damages may be available to a Title VII plaintiff.  \\\\nPunitive damages under Title VII and 41 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1981a may be awarded when there is a\\\\nshowing that the employer intentionally discriminated with malice or reckless indifference to a\\\\nplaintiff\\u2019s federally protected rights.   See Kolstad v. American Dental Assn., 527 U.S. 526 (1999).  \\\\nThere may also be situations where punitive damage awards may be excessive by constitutional\\\\nstandards.  See, e.g., EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 187 F.3d 1241, 1249 (10th Cir.1999)\\\\n(punitive damages in ADA claim that was below statutory maximum was \\u201cstrong indicator\\u201d that\\\\naward was not unconstitutional); Romano v. U-Haul Intenat\\u2019l et al, 233 F.3d 655 (1st Cir. 2000)\\\\n1  Defendant takes such a position, relying on Sierra Club v. Young Life Campaign, Inc.,\\\\n2001 WL 1402568 (D.Colo. 2001).   In turn, Plaintiff relies on the lack of Tenth Circuit precedent\\\\non the issue, and attaches to its Reply an unpublished District of New Mexico opinion which\\\\nignores the question completely. \\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n(finding punitive damages award in Title VII case constitutionally permissible).
