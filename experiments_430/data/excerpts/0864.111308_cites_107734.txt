 Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, §§ 2(c), 9, 75 Stat. 65 , 71.  Five years later, Congress extended FLSA coverage to state and local-government employees for the first time by withdrawing the minimum-wage and overtime exemptions from public hospitals, schools, and mass-transit carriers whose rates and services were subject to state regulation.  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, §§ 102(a) and (b), 80 Stat. 831 .  At the same time, Congress eliminated the overtime exemption for all mass-transit employees other than drivers, operators, and conductors.  § 206(c), 80 Stat. 836 .  The application of the FLSA to public schools and hospitals was ruled to be within Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.  Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968).  The FLSA obligations of public mass-transit systems like SATS were expanded in 1974 when Congress provided for the progressive repeal of the surviving overtime exemption for mass-transit employees.  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, § 21(b), 88 Stat. 68 .  Congress simultaneously brought the States and their subdivisions further within the ambit of the FLSA by extending FLSA coverage to virtually all state and local-government employees.  §§ 6(a)(1) and (6), 88 Stat. 58 , 60, 29 U. S. C. §§ 203 (d) and (x).  SATS complied with the FLSA’s overtime requirements until 1976, when this Court, in National League of Cities , overruled <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , and held that the FLSA could not be *534 applied constitutionally to the “traditional governmental functions” of state and local governments.  Four months after National League of Cities was handed down, SATS informed its employees that the decision relieved SATS of its overtime obligations under the FLSA.  3 Matters rested there until September 17, 1979, when the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor issued an opinion that SAMTA’s operations “are not constitutionally immune from the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act” under National League of Cities .  Opinion WH-499, 6 LRR 91:1138.  On November 21 of that year, SAMTA filed this action against the Secretary of Labor in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.  It sought a declaratory judgment that, contrary to the Wage and Hour Administration’s determination, National League of Cities precluded the application of the FLSA’s overtime requirements to SAMTA’s operations.  The Secretary counterclaimed under 29 U. S. C. §217 for enforcement of the overtime and recordkéeping requirements of the FLSA.

 If there are to be limits on the Federal Government’s power to interfere with state functions — as undoubtedly there are — we must look elsewhere to find them.  We accordingly return to the underlying issue that confronted this Court in National League of Cities — the manner in which the Constitution insulates States from the reach of Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.  Ill The central theme of National League of Cities was that the States occupy a special position in our constitutional system and that the scope of Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause must reflect that position.  Of course, the Commerce Clause by its specific language does not provide any special limitation on Congress’ actions with respect to the States.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 248 (1983) (concurring opinion).  It is equally true, however, that the text of the Constitution provides the beginning rather than the final answer to every inquiry into questions of federalism, for “[bjehind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control.” Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 322 (1934).  National League of Cities reflected the general conviction that the Constitution precludes “the National Government [from] devouring] the essentials of state sovereignty.” <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 205</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  In order to be faithful to the underlying federal premises of the Constitution, courts must look for the “postulates which limit and control.” What has proved problematic is not the perception that the Constitution’s federal structure imposes limitations on the Commerce Clause, but rather the nature and content of those limitations.  One approach to defining the limits on Con *548 gress’ authority to regulate the States under the Commerce Clause is to identify certain underlying elements of political sovereignty that are deemed essential to the States’ “separate and independent existence.” Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869).  This approach obviously underlay the Court’s use of the “traditional governmental function” concept in National League of Cities.  It also has led to the separate requirement that the challenged federal statute “address matters that are indisputably ‘attribute^] of state sovereignty.’” Hodel, 452 U. S., at 288 , quoting National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 845 .  In National League of Cities itself, for example, the Court concluded that decisions by a State concerning the wages and hours of its employees are an “undoubted attribute of state sovereignty.” 426 U. S., at 845 .  The opinion did not explain what aspects of such decisions made them such an “undoubted attribute,” and the Court since then has remarked on the uncertain scope of the concept.

 21 Services of this kind are precisely those with which citizens are more “familiarly and minutely conversant.” The Federalist No. 46, p. 316 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  State and local officials of course must be intimately familiar with these services and sensitive to their quality as well as cost.  Such *579 officials also know that their constituents and the press respond to the adequacy, fair distribution, and cost of these services.  It is this kind of state and local control and accountability that the Framers understood would insure the vitality and preservation of the federal system that the Constitution explicitly requires.  See National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 847-852 .  V Although the Court’s opinion purports to recognize that the States retain some sovereign power, it does not identify even a single aspect of state authority that would remain when the Commerce Clause is invoked to justify federal regulation.  In Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968), overruled by National League of Cities and today reaffirmed, the Court sustained an extension of the FLSA to certain hospitals, institutions, and schools.  Although the Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> was comparatively narrow, Justice Douglas, in dissent, wrote presciently that the Court’s reading of the Commerce Clause would enable “the National Government [to] devour the essentials of state sovereignty, though that sovereignty is attested by the Tenth Amendment.” <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 205</citedDecision> .  Today’s decision makes Justice Douglas’ fear once again a realistic one.  As I view the Court’s decision today as rejecting the basic precepts of our federal system and limiting the constitutional role of judicial review, I dissent.  National League of Cities , following some changes in the composition of the Court, had overruled Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968).  Unlike National League of Cities , the rationale of <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> had not been repeatedly accepted by our subsequent decisions.  Justice O’Connor, the only new Member of the Court since our decision in National League of Cities , has joined the Court in reaffirming its principles.  See Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678 (1982), and FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775 (1982) (O’Connor, J., dissenting in part).  As one commentator noted, stare decisis represents “a natural evolution from the very nature of our institutions.” Lile, Some Views on the Rule of Stare Decisis, 4 Va. L. Rev. 95 , 97 (1916).  In National League of Cities , we referred to the sphere of state sovereignty as including “traditional governmental functions,” a realm which is, of course, difficult to define with precision.  But the luxury of precise definitions is one rarely enjoyed in interpreting and applying the general provisions of our Constitution.  Not surprisingly, therefore, the Court’s attempt to demonstrate the impossibility of definition is unhelpful.

 [Additionally,] the proportion of people actually involved from the total population tends to be greater, the lower the level of govern *576 ment, and this, of course, better approximates the citizen participation ideal.” ACIR, Citizen Participation in the American Federal System 95 (1980).  Moreover, we have witnessed in recent years the rise of numerous special interest groups that engage in sophisticated lobbying, and make substantial campaign contributions to some Members of Congress.  These groups are thought to have significant influence in the shaping and enactment of certain types of legislation.  Contrary to the Court’s view, a “political process” that functions in this way is' unlikely to safeguard the sovereign rights of States and localities.  See n. 9, supra. The opinion of the Court in National League of Cities makes clear that the very essence of a federal system of government is to impose “definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.” 426 U. S., at 842 .  See also the Court’s opinion in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 547, n. 7 (1975).  As Justice Douglas observed in his dissent in <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 203</citedDecision> , extension of the FLSA to the States could “disrupt the fiscal policy of the States and threaten their autonomy in the regulation of health and education.” In Long Island R. Co. the unanimous Court recognized that “[t]his Court’s emphasis on traditional governmental functions and traditional aspects of state sovereignty was not meant to impose a static historical view of state functions generally immune from federal regulation.” 455 U. S.. at 686.

I join both JUSTICE POWELL'S and JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S thoughtful dissents.  JUSTICE POWELL'S reference to the "balancing test" approved in National League of Cities is not identical with the language in that case, which recognized that Congress could not act under its commerce power to infringe on certain fundamental aspects of state sovereignty that are essential to "the States' separate and independent existence." Nor is either test, or JUSTICE *580 O'CONNOR'S suggested approach, precisely congruent with JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S views in 1976, when he spoke of a balancing approach which did not outlaw federal power in areas "where the federal interest is demonstrably greater."
