**Dissenting Opinion**
 In all events, while I recognize that I may be misreading the Court’s opinion, I assume that its holding rests on the predicate that the concerted refusal to work overtime in this case, like the partial strike activity in Briggs-Stratton, is unprotected by § 7.  A scholar who has criticized Briggs-Stratton has observed: “The omission of a federal prohibition against 'quickie’ strikes certainly could not have implied a desire that unions be free to embrace the tactic without restraint; congressional silence almost surely is attributable to the happy circumstance that no prohibition is urgently required because American labor unions have almost unanimously *158 fected such tactics.” Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L, Rev. 1337, 1347 (1972).  The Union argues that Congress focused upon partial strike activity during passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136 , relying upon a provision passed by the House, but rejected in the Conference Committee, that declared unlawful “any sit-down strike or other concerted interference with an employer’s operations conducted by remaining on the employer’s premises.” H. R. 3020, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., § 12 (a)(3)(A) (1947).  See H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 27-28, 43-44 (1947); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38-39, 42-43, 58-59 (1947).  The concerted refusal to work overtime in this ease does not involve “concerted interference with an employer’s operations conducted by remaining on the employer’s premises.” In NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , the Court held that the partial strike activity in that case did not violate the union’s duty to bargain in good faith; in other words, even though the activity was not protected by § 7, it was not prohibited by § 8.  Contrary to the Court’s implication, ante, at 141, the case did not hold that the States could not prohibit such activity, but only that the NLRB had not been authorized to do so. Congress’ failure to grant power over such activity to the NLRB hardly amounts to withdrawal of the same power from the States.  The Court’s quotation, Ibid., from Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, <citedDecision>382 U. S. 181, 187</citedDecision> , when read in context, is nothing more than a reference to a statement in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 , which poses, but does not answer, the question whether pre-emption extends to activity that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.  See n. 2, supra. I cannot agree with the Court’s conclusion that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, overruled today, numbers among those that have been eroded rather than preserved.  See ante, at 151-154, and n. 12.  The decision in Insurance Agents, supra, is readily distinguishable.  See n. 3, supra. It is true that Briggs-Stratton has been limited to its facts insofar as it sanctions judicial determination whether conduct arguably protected by § 7 or prohibited by § 8 is actually protected or prohibited.  Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 291 ; San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra, at 245 n. 4; see Insurance Agents, supra, at 492-494 , and nn. 22, 23.  But the rule established in Garmon , and reaffirmed in Lockridge , is fully consistent with the conclusion that the States may regulate conduct that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.
