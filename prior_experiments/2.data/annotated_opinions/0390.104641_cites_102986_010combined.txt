Mason filed a brief in No. 40, as amici curiae, urging affirmance. Solicitor General Perlman, Assistant Attorney General Caudle, Arnold Raum and Hilbert P. Zarky filed a brief in Nos. 40 and 41 on behalf of the United States, as amicus curiae, urging reversal. MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE delivered the opinion of the Court. The principal question is whether a lessee of mineral rights in allotted and restricted Indian lands is immunized by the Constitution against payment of nondiscriminatory state gross production taxes and state excise taxes on petroleum produced from such lands. In effect the issue is whether this Court's previous decisions in Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U.S. 503 ; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U.S. 549 ; and Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, 296 U.S. 521 , invalidating such taxes as applied to like lessees, have been so undermined by later decisions, in particular Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., <targetCase>303 U.S. 376</targetCase> , that they should now be overruled. With certain exceptions, [1] the lands from which was extracted the petroleum sought to be taxed are held in *344 trust by the United States, pursuant to allotments made under the General Allotment Act, [2] for various members of the Pottawatomie, Apache, Comanche, and Otoe and Missouria Tribes. [3] All the lands are located within the State of Oklahoma and at all material times they were restricted [4] against alienation by the Indian cestui owners without the consent of the Secretary of the Interior. [5] He *345 approved each of the leases now in question. The respondents Texas Company (No. 40) and Magnolia Petroleum Company (No. 41) acquired their leases before Oklahoma levied the assessments now in issue, either as original lessees or by assignment from non-Indians who were such lessees.
**Combined Opinion**
After hearing, that court sustained the commission's demurrer to the company's amended petition and ordered it dismissed. Appeal was duly taken to the state supreme court. In No. 41, following a different statutory procedure, the Magnolia Company appealed from the assessments against it directly to that court. In both cases the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, with one judge dissenting, held the assessments invalid. The decisions rested flatly on the ground that the lessee was an instrumentality of the Federal Government and as such, under prior and controlling decisions of this Court, particularly in the Large Oil, Gipsy Oil, and Barnsdall Refineries cases, supra, not subject to the taxes in question. [15] In the Texas Company case the court expressly distinguished <targetCase>Helvering</targetCase> v. Mountain Producers Corp., <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , on the ground that the decision in that case related *349 to income taxes assessed against the lessee there situated as were the lessees here. The opinion, indicating the writer's personal view that reconsideration of the earlier decisions well might be sought, nevertheless stated: "But it is thought beyond the power of this court to now engage in such reconsideration, in view of the cited decisions of the higher authority which thus far wholly sustain the claim of [the Texas Company] to immunity from the tax here involved. "Upon questions of federal law, citizens and their attorneys have the right to rely upon decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, and upon such questions it is our fixed duty to follow such decisions, leaving to the United States Congress or Supreme Court the making of the necessary changes in such legal rules." From the state supreme court's decisions [16] the Oklahoma Tax Commission filed appeals in this Court. We dismissed the appeals for want of jurisdiction. But treating them as applications for certiorari, [17] we granted the writs and consolidated the cases for argument. 333 U.S. 870 .
**Combined Opinion**
They claim only that they are constitutionally immune from contributing *352 to the plan's support. As a matter entirely fresh, the contention would not seem weighty. II. But neither issue is fresh. Each is complicated by this Court's prior decisions squarely ruling that the taxes are invalid as unconstitutional intrusions by the state upon the performance of federal functions. Those decisions have not been explicitly overruled. But it is strongly urged that our later decisions, especially in <targetCase>Helvering</targetCase> v. Mountain Producers Corp., <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , have stricken the foundation from beneath the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions, supra, so that the latter no longer can stand in reason and consistency with the former. It is true that this Court's more recent pronouncements have beaten a fairly large retreat from its formerly prevailing ideas concerning the breadth of so-called intergovernmental immunities from taxation, a retreat which has run in both directions  to restrict the scope of immunity of private persons seeking to clothe themselves with governmental character from both federal and state taxation. The history of the immunity, by and large in both aspects, represents a rising or expanding curve, tapering off into a falling or contracting one. Our present problem lies on the constitutional level. It requires reconsideration of former decisions specifically in point, together with later ones deviating in rationale. It is of substantial importance both for the states' powers of taxation and for the subjects on which they may impinge. Moreover, even though the immediate questions are closely related to federal policies concerning Indian lands, they are equally tangent to considerations affecting other types of situation raising questions of immunity.
**Combined Opinion**
II, § 6. The Oklahoma court held that the 1910 reenactment of the statute [25] imposed a property tax. McAlester-Edwards Coal Co. v. Trapp, 43 Okla. 510 . But the statute, as applied to a lessee of restricted Indian coal lands, was held by this Court to be an occupational tax and so an unconstitutional burden on the lessee, who was held to be an instrumentality of the Federal Government. Choctaw, O. & G.R. Co. v. Harrison, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> . Next the Court held the lease itself a federal instrumentality immune from state taxation. Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> . The Oklahoma legislature revised the gross production tax statute in 1915 and again in 1916, a principal change being the provision that the tax was in lieu of all other ad valorem taxes. [26] The revised tax was held by the Oklahoma Supreme Court to be a property tax. [27] But this Court rejected that construction sub silentio and invalidated the tax in memorandum opinions citing only the Choctaw, O. & G.R. Co. case ( 235 U.S. 292 ) and *357 the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. case ( 240 U.S. 522 ). Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U.S. 503 ; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U.S. 549 . Suspicions that this Court had overlooked the fact that under the revised statute the gross production tax was in lieu of rather than in addition to all other ad valorem property taxes, [28] were dispelled by Mr. Justice Holmes' remark in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, <targetCase>supra at 504-505</targetCase>, that the statutory change had been noticed and regarded as immaterial. [29] If a gross receipts tax was a burden on the Federal Government "so as to interfere with the performance of its functions, it could not be saved because it was in lieu of a tax upon property or was so characterized." See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134 , 158. The high-water mark of immunity for non-Indian lessees of restricted and allotted Indian lands came in 1922 when the Gillespie decision, supra, invalidated an Oklahoma net income tax upon income derived by a lessee from sales of his share of oil produced from restricted lands. The non-Indian lessee's immunity was last sustained here by Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> . That decision held, on application of a rule of strict construction of congressional waivers, that Congress' express waiver of immunity from gross production taxes on oil produced from the specified Indian lands did not extend to petroleum excise taxes. The state did not challenge *358 the implied constitutional immunity but pitched its argument on the ground of statutory exemption. [30] The instrumentality doctrine has been applied to confer a correlative immunity upon private lessees of state-owned lands. The Texas rule that oil and gas leases are present sales to the lessees of the oil and gas in place caused this Court to sustain the imposition of the federal income tax upon income of the lessee derived from the sale of oil and gas produced from lands leased from that state. It was observed that ". .
**Combined Opinion**
Although this decision may be taken to mark a turning point in expansion of the lessee's immunity, it was not immediately permitted to impair the Gillespie rationale. A tax on income would be no greater burden where, under applicable state law, "title" to the oil did not "pass" until the oil was removed from the ground. And although Justices Brandeis, Stone, Roberts and Cardozo contended that the Gillespie decision could not stand consistently with the principles which had been reaffirmed in the Group No. 1 Oil case, a majority of one in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393 , provided a corollary to the rule of the Gillespie case. This was done by holding that the Federal Government was barred from taxing the income of a lessee of state lands as the state was barred from taxing the income of the lessee of federal lands. A parallel immunity from state occupational or privilege taxes was once accorded private contractors with, or agencies of, the Government, Williams v. Talladega, *359 226 U.S. 404 , notwithstanding the venerable rule that the property of such a contractor or agency is liable to state property taxation. See the cases cited <targetCase>supra</targetCase> in note 18. Decisions curtailing this immunity were presaged by Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U.S. 514 . It held subject to federal income taxation income received by a consulting engineer from a state for services in connection with temporary work. Equally significant was Alward v. Johnson, 282 U.S. 509 , 514, which sustained a state tax measured by gross receipts on the property of a stage line engaged in carrying the mails. [31] Later this Court sustained a state tax on the gross receipts of a contractor with the Federal Government, James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134 ; Silas Mason Co. v. Tax Commission, 302 U.S. 186 ; a state tax on the net income of such a contractor, Atkinson v. Tax Commission, 303 U.S. 20 ; state sales and use taxes on purchases of materials used by a contractor in performing a cost-plus contract with the United States, Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U.S. 1 ; Curry v. United States, 314 U.S. 14 ; and a state severance tax imposed on a contractor who severed and purchased timber from lands owned by the United States, Wilson v. Cook, 327 U.S. 474 . It was pointed out that ". .
**Combined Opinion**
. . [does not prohibit] a tax exacted from the contractors merely because it is passed on economically, by the terms of the contract or otherwise, as a part of the construction cost to the Government. So far as such a non-discriminatory state tax upon the contractor enters into the cost of the materials to the Government, that is but a normal *360 incident of the organization within the same territory of two independent taxing sovereignties. The asserted right of the one to be free of taxation by the other does not spell immunity from paying the added costs, attributable to the taxation of those who furnish supplies to the Government and who have been granted no tax immunity." Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U.S. 1 , 8-9. The opportunity to reexamine the Gillespie and Coronado cases arose in 1938 in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., <targetCase>303 U.S. 376</targetCase> , the decision upon which the Oklahoma commission relies most strongly to secure reversal of the judgments in the present cases. The Mountain Producers case involved the application of the federal income tax law to a cestui of an express trust which received the proceeds of the sale of oil taken from school lands owned by the State of Wyoming. The Court declined to distinguish the Gillespie and Coronado decisions on the narrow ground available, the fact that the taxpayer was a cestui of a trust which received the proceeds of the sale of the oil rather than the lessee itself. 303 U.S. at 383. [32] Rather the Court sought broader grounding, which lay in reconsideration of the foundations of the Gillespie and Coronado decisions. The opinion stated: "The ground of the decision in the Gillespie case, as stated by Mr. Justice Holmes in speaking for the Court, was that `a tax upon the leases' was `a tax upon the power to make them, and could be *361 used to destroy the power to make them' (240 U.S. p. 530) and that a tax `upon the profits of the leases' was `a direct hamper upon the effort of the United States to make the best terms that it can for its wards.' [ 257 U.S. at 506 .]
**Combined Opinion**
303 U.S. at 384. Noting that it had held that the Gillespie ruling should be limited strictly to cases closely analogous, [33] and asserting that "the distinctions thus maintained have attenuated its teaching and raised grave doubt as to whether it should longer be supported," 303 U.S. at 384-385, the Court went on to say: "In numerous decisions we have had occasion to declare the competing principle, buttressed by the most cogent considerations, that the power to tax should not be crippled `by extending the constitutional exemption from taxation to those subjects which fall within the general application of nondiscriminatory laws, and where no direct burden is laid upon the governmental instrumentality and there is only remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of government.' Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U.S. 216 , 225, and illustrations there cited." 303 U.S. at 385. That competing principle the Court found applicable to the case before it and to require that the decisions in the Gillespie and Coronado cases be overruled. Rejecting as insubstantial the distinction based on the passage of title to the oil at the time of making the lease, compare Group *362 No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , with Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , and after reviewing various other decisions denying the immunity when claimed by private persons, 303 U.S. at 385-386, the Court said: "These decisions in a variety of applications enforce what we deem to be the controlling view  that immunity from non-discriminatory taxation sought by a private person for his property or gains because he is engaged in operations under a government contract or lease cannot be supported by merely theoretical conceptions of interference with the functions of government. Regard must be had to substance and direct effects." 303 U.S. at 386. IV. Respondents strongly urge that the Mountain Producers decision is not controlling or effective to require reversal in these cases, since it involved a tax on net income rather than gross production and excise taxes. And they insist that a sharp line should be drawn between what they call lessees performing a governmental function and independent contractors doing work for the Government. [34] The latter distinction is largely, if not altogether verbal, in the context of the fact situations in these cases.
**Combined Opinion**
In the light of the broad groundings of the Mountain Producers decision and of later decisions, we cannot say that the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions remain immune to the effects of the Mountain Producers decision and others which have followed it. They "are out of harmony with correct principle," as were the Gillespie and Coronado decisions and, accordingly, they should be, and they now are, overruled. This accords with the result reached in Santa Rita Oil Co. v. State Board of Equalization, 112 Mont. 359 . Moreover, since the decisions in Choctaw, O. & G.R. Co. v. Harrison, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , and Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , rest upon the same foundations as those underlying the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions, indeed supplied those foundations, we think they too should be, and they now are, overruled. We do not imply, by this decision, that Congress does not have power to immunize these lessees from the taxes we think the Constitution permits Oklahoma to impose in the absence of such action. [37] The question whether immunity shall be extended in situations like these is *366 essentially legislative in character. But Congress has not created an immunity here by affirmative action, [38] and "The immunity formerly said to rest on constitutional implication cannot now be resurrected in the form of statutory implication." Oklahoma Tax Commission v. United States, 319 U.S. 598 , 604. And see Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U.S. 466 , 480: ".

[23] Distinguishing Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, 271 U.S. 609 , on the ground that there the interest of the Indian lessor had not been prepaid or segregated. [24] See The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall, 737; The New York Indians, 5 Wall. 761 . Those early decisions seem to rest on the basis that the Indian tribes possessed many attributes of sovereignty. As to the immunity from state taxation of lands acquired by individual Indians by treaty or under the general homestead laws rather than under the General Allotment Act, see Cohen, op. cit. <targetCase>supra note 5</targetCase>, at 257-258, 259-260. Lands outside a reservation purchased with restricted Indian funds from a person who did not hold the land tax exempt were held subject to state taxes in Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U.S. 575 . But Congress specifically exempted such lands from taxation. Act of June 20, 1936, 49 Stat. 1542 , as amended, 50 Stat. 188 (to limit the exemption to homesteads), 25 U.S.C. § 412a.
**Combined Opinion**
[34] Among the cases which one or the other of respondents attempts to distinguish on the ground that the tax was imposed on an independent contractor rather than a "true Federal instrumentality" are: James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134 ; Buckstaff Co. v. McKinley, 308 U.S. 358 ; Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U.S. 1 ; and Wilson v. Cook, 327 U.S. 474 . It is also contended that cases sustaining taxes on the property of a federal instrumentality, e.g., Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5 ; Alward v. Johnson, 282 U.S. 509 ; Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, 288 U.S. 325 , are not inconsistent with the view they ask us to take. Cf. Part I supra. [35] The incongruity of the doctrine respondents ask us to perpetuate is underscored by decisions subsequent to the Mountain Producers case withdrawing income tax immunity for state and federal official salaries. <targetCase>Helvering</targetCase> v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405 ; Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U.S. 466 . See generally, Powell, The Waning of Intergovernmental Tax Immunities, 58 Harv. L.

Production from the latter lands has been subject to Oklahoma's gross production tax since 1928. See note 42 infra. The Government, in its brief amicus curiae, states that, because differences in the value of different tracts of land would be reflected in the bonuses which lessees are willing to pay, an exact comparison of bonuses is impossible. [37] See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134 , 160-161; Pittman v. Home Owners Corp., 308 U.S. 21 , 32-33; Maricopa County v. Valley Bank, 318 U.S. 357 , 361; Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U.S. 705 , 715-719; Oklahoma Tax Commission v. United States, 319 U.S. 598 , 606-607; Mayo v. United States, 319 U.S. 441 , 446; Smith v. Davis, 323 U.S. 111 , 116-119.

Barnsdall Refineries, 296 U.S. 521 , held that this statute did not authorize the imposition of the state's petroleum excise tax. See text at note 30 supra. [40] 43 Stat. 176 .

Stat. § 832 (1941). Although respondents tell us that this argument was urged upon the Oklahoma Supreme Court, that court did not mention this possible state ground but rested its decision exclusively on the federal ground. We do not purport to decide whether Oklahoma law affords the exemption which federal law denies. See note 4 as to the assessments attributable to the undivided interests in lands held by non-Indians in No.
