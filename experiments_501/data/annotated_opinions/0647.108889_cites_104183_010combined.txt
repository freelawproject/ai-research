 The North Dakota statute, however, requires only that a majority of the stock be owned by pharmacists.  But the North Dakota Supreme Court held that the difference did not take this case out from under the Liggett case because under both statutes control of the corporation having a pharmacy license had to be in the hands of pharmacists responsible for the management and operation of the pharmacy.  That court therefore remanded the case, so that the Board could conduct “an administrative hearing on the application, sans the constitutional issue, pursuant to our Administrative Agencies Practice Act,” 202 N. W. 2d 140, 145 (italics added).  The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted, 411 U. S. 947 .  *159 I We are met at the outset with a suggestion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of North Dakota is not “final” within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 1257 which restricts our jurisdiction to review state court decisions.  3 The finality requirement of 28 U. S. C. § 1257 , which limits our review of state court judgments, serves several ends: (1) it avoids piecemeal review of state court decisions; (2) it avoids giving advisory opinions in cases where there may be no real “case” or “controversy” in the sense of Art. Ill; (3) it limits review of state court determinations of federal constitutional issues to leave at a minimum federal intrusion in state affairs.  Mr. Justice Frankfurter, writing for the Court in Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 120, 124</citedDecision> , summarized the requirement by Congress that in appeals from federal district courts as well as in review of state court decisions the judgments be “final”: “This requirement has the support of considerations generally applicable to good judicial administration.  It avoids the mischief of economic waste and of delayed justice.  Only in very few situations, where intermediate rulings may carry serious public consequences, has there been a departure from this requirement of finality for federal appellate jurisdiction.  This prerequisite to review derives added force when the jurisdiction of this Court is invoked to upset the decision of a State court. Here we are in the realm of potential conflict between the courts of two different governments.  And so, ever since 1789, Congress has granted this Court the power to intervene *160 in State litigation only after 'the highest court of a State in which a decision in the suit could be had’ has rendered a 'final judgment or decree.’ § 237 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. §344 (a).  This requirement is not one of those technicalities to be easily scorned.  It is an important factor in the smooth working of our federal system.” But, as he pointed out, this concept of “finality” has a “penumbral area.” Ibid. Speaking for the Court in that case, he held that Nebraska’s ruling on the legality of a radio license issued by the Federal Communications Commission could be reviewed even though the state court had not yet determined the final accounting.

 There were state law questions to be considered on the remand, for the state board had also rested its denial of a permit on the failure of Snyder’s to meet certain structural and safety standards.  The Supreme Court *163 remanded for an administrative hearing on those other issues.  If we deny review at this point, respondent has no constitutional barrier to the grant of a license.  The state licensing authority might, of course, after an administrative hearing reinstate its earlier findings that the respondent does not meet the necessary structural and safety standards.  If' respondent is denied a license for that reason, the denial will obviously be on a state ground.  If respondent is granted a license, the battle over the constitutionality of the new Act will be lost as far as this case is concerned.  There is no suggestion that “the remaining litigation may raise other federal questions,” <citedDecision>Radio Station WOW</citedDecision> v. Johnson, <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 127</citedDecision> , “such as is true of eminent domain cases.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> For in those cases the federal constitutional question embraces not only a taking, but a taking on payment of just compensation.  A state judgment is not final unless it covers both aspects of that integral problem.  See Grays Harbor Co. v. Coats-Fordney Co., 243 U. S. 251, 256 .  It would appear that, as & matter of North Dakota procedure, the only way in which the Board could preserve the constitutional issue would be to defy its own State Supreme Court and deny the application on the ground of failure to meet the ownership requirement.  The state Administrative Agencies Practice Act provides that: “Any party to any proceeding heard by an administrative agency” may appeal from the decision of the agency.  N. D. Cent. Code § 28-32-15.  The statute appears to treat the agency as a tribunal and not as a “party” able to appeal its own order.
