**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 Reinfeld thereupon delivered his own money to petitioner.  Petitioner’s control over the cash so received was such that, in the absence of Reinfeld’s unlikely repudiation of the transaction and demand for the money’s return, petitioner could enjoy its use as fully as though his title to it were unassailable.” Rutkin v. United States, 343 U. S. 130, 136-137 .  (Emphasis supplied.) The analogy between the borrower and the embezzler was lucidly analyzed by Judge Sibley in McKnight v. Commissioner, 127 F. 2d 572, 573-574 .  The several cases relied on by the Court do not, in our judgment, justify imposing a tax upon embezzled money.  Corliss v. Bowers, 281 U. S. 376 , involved income accumulating in a trust fund belonging to the taxpayer and over which he retained control.  North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet, 286 U. S. 417 ; United States v. Lewis, <citedDecision>340 U. S. 590</citedDecision> ; and Healy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 , were cases in which the taxpayer had asserted a bona fide, though mistaken, claim of right.  In North American Oil, the taxpayer not only had a bona fide claim to the money taxed, but there had been an adjudication that he was entitled to it, and there was only the tenuous possibility that a competing claimant might later upset that adjudication.  The <citedDecision>Lewis</citedDecision> and Healy cases involved a tax on payments made and received as a result of mutual mistake, and it was held that the administration of the tax laws on an annual basis need not be upset for the convenience of those who caused the mistaken payments to be made and reported as income.  By contrast, the victims do not cause embezzlements, and the Government is not misled or inconvenienced under Wilcox because the embezzler is always fully aware that the embezzled funds are not rightfully his and presumably will not report otherwise.  See the dissenting opinion in Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, 150 .  It is interesting to note that on July 22, 1959, shortly after the Bartkus decision, Illinois, in order to avoid the .danger of prosecuting men in both state and federal courts for the same crime, passed a statute making conviction or acquittal in a federal prosecution a defense to a state prosecution- for the same criminal act.  Illinois Laws, 1959, p. 1893, §1; 38 Ill. Ann. Stat. (Cum. Supp. 1960) § 601.1.  Thus, while Illinois is moving away from such double prosecutions, this Court is moving even further than Bartkus in the direction of authorizing such prosecutions.  The subsequent history of the Rutkin-Reinfeld controversy can, in part, be read in United States v. Rutkin, 208 F. 2d 647 , especially Judge Kalodner’s dissenting opinion, at 655; United States v. Rutkin, 212 F. 2d 641 , especially at 644; and Rutkin v. Reinfeld, 122 F. Supp. 265 , reversed, 229 F. 2d 248 .
