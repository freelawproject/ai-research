 39 In the only judicial test a Circuit Court held that the legislation was patently unconstitutional.  Ex parte Henderson, 11 Fed. Cas. 1067 , No. 6,349.  It is true that the Constitution expressly grants Congress power to make all rules necessary and proper to govern and regulate those persons who are serving in the “land and naval Forces.” But the Necessary and Proper *21 Clause cannot operate to extend military jurisdiction to any group of persons beyond that class described in Clause 14 — “the land and naval Forces.” Under the grand design of the Constitution civilian courts are the normal repositories of power to try persons charged with crimes against the United States.  And to protect persons brought before these courts, Article III and the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments establish the right to trial by jury, to indictment by a grand jury and a number of other specific safeguards.  By way of contrast the jurisdiction of military tribunals is a very limited and extraordinary jurisdiction derived from the cryptic language in Art. I, § 8, and, at most, was intended to be only a narrow exception to the normal and preferred method of trial in courts of law. 40 Every extension of military jurisdiction is an encroachment on the jurisdiction of the civil courts, and, more important, acts as a deprivation of the right to jury trial and of other treasured constitutional protections.  Having run up against the steadfast bulwark of the Bill of Rights, the Necessary and Proper Clause cannot extend the scope of Clause 14.  Nothing said here contravenes the rule laid down in McCulloch v. Maryland, <citedDecision>4 Wheat. 316, at 421</citedDecision> , that: “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.” *22 In <citedDecision>McCulloch</citedDecision> this Court was confronted with the problem of determining the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause in a situation where no specific restraints on governmental power stood in the way.  Here the problem is different.  Not only does Clause 14, by its terms, limit military jurisdiction to members of the “land and naval Forces,” but Art. Ill, § 2 and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments require that certain express safeguards, which were designed to protect persons from oppressive governmental practices, shall be given in criminal prosecutions — safeguards which cannot be given in a military trial. In the light of these as well as other constitutional provisions, and the historical background in which they were formed, military trial of civilians is inconsistent with both the “letter and spirit of the constitution.” Further light is reflected on the scope of Clause 14 by the Fifth Amendment.  That Amendment which was adopted shortly after the Constitution reads: “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; .  .  .  .” (Emphasis added.)

 .  Shall the Union be constituted the guardian of the common safety?  Are fleets and armies and revenues necessary to this purpose?  The government of the Union must be empowered to pass all laws, and to make all regulations which have relation to them.  ... “Every view we may take of the subject, as candid inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management.  ... A government, the constitution of .which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the powers which a free people ought to delegate to any government, would be an unsafe and improper depositary of the national interests.  Wherever these can with propriety be confided, the coincident powers may safely accompany them.” No less an authority than Chief Justice Marshall, in McCulloch v. Maryland, <citedDecision>4 Wheat. 316</citedDecision> , has taught us that the Necessary and Proper Clause is to be read with all the powers of Congress, so that “where the law is not prohibited, and is really calculated to effect any of the objects entrusted to the government, to undertake here to inquire into the degree of its necessity, would be to pass the line which circumscribes the judicial department, and to tread on legislative ground.” <citedDecision>Id., at 423</citedDecision> .  *70 I think it no answer to say, as my brother Black does, that “having run up against the steadfast bulwark of the Bill of Rights, the Necessary and Proper Clause cannot extend the scope of [Art. I] Clause 14.” Eor that simply begs the question as to whether there is such a collision, an issue to which I address myself below.  For analytical purposes, I think it useful to break down the issue before us into two questions: First, is there a rational connection between the trial of these army wives by court-martial and the power of Congress to make rules for the governance of the land and naval forces; in other words, is there any initial power here at all?  Second, if there is such a rational connection, to what extent does this statute, though reasonably calculated to subserve an enumerated power, collide with other express limitations on congressional power; in other words, can this statute, however appropriate to the Article I power looked at in isolation, survive against the requirements of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments?  I recognize that these two questions are ultimately one and the same, since the scope of the Article I power is not separable from the limitations imposed by Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  Nevertheless I think it will make for clarity of analysis to consider them separately.  A. I assume, for the moment, therefore, that we may disregard other limiting provisions of the Constitution, and examine the Article I power in isolation.
