 “ (b) Failure to Collect and Pay Over Tax, or Attempt to Defeat or Evade Tax. — Any person required under this chapter to collect, account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this chapter, who willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, and any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.” (26 U. S. C. (1952 ed.) § 145 (b).) § 7201.  Attempt to Evade or Defeat Tax. “Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than HOjOOO, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.” (26 U, S. C. § 7201.) The dissenters in Rutkin stated that the Court had rejected the Wilcox interpretation of § 22 (a).  Id., at 140.  The Government contends that the adoption in Wilcox of a claim of right test as a touchstone of taxability had no support in the prior cases of this Court; that the claim of right test was a doctrine invoked by the Court in aid of the concept of annual accounting, to determine when, not whether, receipts constituted income.  See North American Oil v. Burnet, 286 U. S. 417 ; United States v. Lewis, <citedDecision>340 U. S. 590</citedDecision> ; Nealy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 .  In view of our reasoning set forth below, we need not pass on this contention.  The use to which we put the claim of right test here is only to demonstrate that, whatever its validity as a test of whether certain receipts constitute income, it calls for no distinction between Wilcox and Rutkin .  In Marienfeld v. United States, 214 F. 2d 632 , the Eighth Circuit stated, “We find it difficult to reconcile the Wilcox case with the later opinion of the Supreme Court in Rutkin .  .  .  .” Id., at 636 .

 e., that a taxpayer must report in gross income, in the year in which received, money or property acquired under a ''claim of right” — a colorable claim of the right to exclusive possession of the money or property.  Thus, in its complete form, the sentence in North American Oil from which the above-quoted fragment was extracted reads: “If a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without *257 restriction as to its [sic] disposition, he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.” Id., at 424.  (Emphasis added.) But embezzled funds, like stolen property generally, are not “earnings” in any sense and are held without a vestige of a colorable claim of right; they constitute the principal of a debt.  Of no significance whatever is the formality of “consensual recognition, express or implied” of an obligation to repay.  By substituting this meaningless abstraction in place of the omitted portion of the North American Oil test of when a receipt constitutes taxable income, the prevailing opinion today goes far beyond overruling Wilcox — it reduces a substantial body of tax law into uncertainty and confusion.  The above-cited case of United States v. Lewis, <citedDecision>340 U. S. 590</citedDecision> , decided 19 years after North American Oil, demonstrates the truth of this.  For there we said: “The ‘claim of right’ interpretation of the tax laws has long been used to give finality to [the accounting] period, and is now deeply rooted in the federal tax system.  .  .  .  We see no reason why the Court should depart from this well-settled interpretation merely because it results in an advantage or disadvantage to a taxpayer.” <citedDecision>340 U. S., at 592</citedDecision> .  The same principle was reiterated and applied in Healy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 .  The supposed conflict between Wilcox and Rutkin, upon which The Chief Justice’s opinion seeks to justify its repudiation of Wilcox, 7 has been adequately treated in *258 the opinion of Mr. Justice Black, and I agree with him that those cases were fully intended to be, and are, reconcilable, both on their controlling facts and applicable law. If the unnecessarily broad language used in the Rutkin opinion has misled any of the lower federal courts in their understanding of the principles underlying Wilcox , we should clarify their understanding at this time, and continue our adherence to “a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 .  “A proper regard for its genesis, as well as its very clear language, requires also that [the Sixteenth] Amendment shall not be extended by loose construction .... Congress cannot by any definition [of income] it may adopt conclude the matter, since it cannot by legislation alter the Constitution, from which alone it derives its power to legislate, and within whose limitations alone that power can be lawfully exercised.” Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 206 .  See, e. g., Spear Box Co. v. Commissioner, 182 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Helvering v. Jane Holding Corp., 109 F. 2d 933 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Pacific Magnesium, Inc., v. Westover, 86 F. Supp. 644 (D. C. S. D. Cal.).  See, e. g., Schweppe v. Commissioner, 168 F. 2d 284 (C. A. 9th Cir.); North American Coal Corp. v. Commissioner, 97 F. 2d 325 (C. A. 6th Cir.); Securities Co. v. United States, 85 F. Supp. 532 (D. C. S. D. N.Y.).  26 U. S. C. §§ 6321-6323 , 6331; Bankruptcy Act, § 64 (a), 11 U. S. C. § 104 (a).
