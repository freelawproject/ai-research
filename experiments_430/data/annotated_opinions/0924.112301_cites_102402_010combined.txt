 476 U. S., at 576 .  Appellant Brown-Forman was a liquor distiller that offered "promotional allowances" to wholesalers purchasing Brown-Forman products.  The New York Liquor Authority, however, did not allow Brown-Forman to operate its rebate scheme in New York and, moreover, determined for the purposes of the affirmation law that the promotional allowances lowered the effective price charged to wholesalers outside New York. Because other States with affirmation laws similar to New York's did not deem the promotional allowances to lower the price charged to wholesalers, appellant argued that the New York law offered the company the Hobson's choice of lowering its New York prices, thereby violating the affirmation laws of other States, or of discontinuing the promotional allowances altogether.  This, appellant alleged, amounted to extraterritorial regulation of interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  Id., at 579-582 .  This Court agreed, reaffirming and elaborating on our established view that a state law that has the "practical effect" of regulating commerce occurring wholly outside that State's borders is invalid under the Commerce Clause.  We began by reviewing past decisions, starting with Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., <citedDecision>294 U. S. 511</citedDecision> (1935).  The Court in Seelig struck down a New York statute that set minimum prices for milk purchased from producers in New York and other States and banned the resale within New York of milk that had been purchased for a lower price.  Because Vermont dairy farmers produced milk at a lower cost than New York dairy farmers, the effect of the statute was to eliminate the competitive economic advantage they enjoyed by equalizing the price of milk from all sources.  Writing for the Court, Justice Cardozo pronounced that the Commerce Clause does not permit a State "to establish a wage scale or a scale of prices for use *333 in other states, and to bar the sale of the products .  .  .  unless the scale has been observed." <citedDecision>Id., at 528</citedDecision> .  Relying on Seelig, the Court in Brown-Forman concluded: "While a State may seek lower prices for its consumers, it may not insist that producers or consumers in other States surrender whatever competitive advantages they may possess." 476 U. S., at 580 ; see also Schwegmann Brothers Giant Super Markets v. Louisiana Milk Comm'n, 365 F. Supp. 1144, 1152-1156 (MD La. 1973), summarily aff'd, 416 U. S. 922 (1974).  After drawing upon Seelig, the Brown-Forman Court also discussed Healy I with approval.  There, as we have noted, the Court of Appeals struck down an earlier version of Connecticut's price-affirmation statute, which was essentially identical to the one at issue in Brown-Forman, because the statute "made it impossible for a brewer to lower its price in a bordering State in response to market conditions so long as it had a higher posted price in effect in Connecticut." 476 U. S., at 581-582 .  [9] *334 Applying these principles, we concluded that the New York statute had an impermissible extraterritorial effect: "Once a distiller has posted prices in New York, it is not free to change its prices elsewhere in the United States during the relevant month. Forcing a merchant to seek regulatory approval in one State before undertaking a transaction in another directly regulates interstate commerce." Id., at 582 (footnote omitted).  Although New York might regulate the sale of liquor within its borders, and might seek low prices for its residents, it was prohibited by the Commerce Clause from " `project[ing] its legislation into [other States] by regulating the price to be paid' " for liquor in those States.  Id., at 583 , quoting Seelig, <citedDecision>294 U. S., at 521</citedDecision> .  Despite the language in Seagram, the Court did not find the prospect of these extra-territorial effects to be speculative.  The majority rejected as "Pollyannaish" the dissent's suggestion that flexible application by the relevant administrative bodies would obviate the problem and noted that the proliferation of affirmation laws after Seagram had greatly multiplied the likelihood that distillers would be subject to blatantly inconsistent obligations.  [10] The Court squarely rejected New York's argument that the Twenty-first Amendment, which bans the importation or possession of intoxicating liquors into a State "in violation of the laws thereof," saved the statute from invalidation under the Commerce Clause.  Although the Court acknowledged that the Amendment vested in New York considerable authority *335 to regulate the domestic sale of alcohol, the Amendment did not immunize the State from the Commerce Clause's proscription of state statutes that regulate the sale of alcohol in other States.  476 U. S., at 585 .  Accordingly, the Court's conclusion that the New York law regulated out-of-state sales conclusively resolved the Twenty-first Amendment issue against New York. Ibid. The Court acknowledged that its Brown-Forman decision was in considerable tension with Seagram.

 [11] III In light of this history, we now must assess the constitutionality of the Connecticut statute, which is neither prospective nor retrospective, but rather "contemporaneous." As explained above, the statute requires only that out-of-state shippers affirm that their prices are no higher than the prices being charged in the border States as of the moment of affirmation.  The principles guiding this assessment, principles made clear in Brown-Forman and in the cases upon which it relied, reflect the Constitution's special concern both with the maintenance *336 of a national economic union unfettered by state-imposed limitations on interstate commerce [12] and with the autonomy of the individual States within their respective spheres.  [13] Taken together, our cases concerning the extra-territorial effects of state economic regulation stand at a minimum for the following propositions: First, the "Commerce Clause .  .  .  precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the State's borders, whether or not the commerce has effects within the State," Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U. S. 624, 642-643 (1982) (plurality opinion); see also Brown-Forman, 476 U. S., at 581-583 ; and, specifically, a State may not adopt legislation that has the practical effect of establishing "a scale of prices for use in other states," Seelig, <citedDecision>294 U. S., at 528</citedDecision> .  Second, a statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting State's authority and is invalid regardless of whether the statute's extraterritorial reach was intended by the legislature.  The critical inquiry is whether the practical effect of the regulation is to control conduct beyond the boundaries of the State.  Brown-Forman, 476 U. S., at 579 .  Third, the practical effect of the statute must be evaluated not only by considering the consequences of the statute itself, but also by considering how the challenged statute may interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes of other States and what effect would arise if not one, but many or every, State adopted similar legislation.  Generally speaking, the *337 Commerce Clause protects against inconsistent legislation arising from the projection of one state regulatory regime into the jurisdiction of another State.  Cf. CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, 481 U. S. 69, 88-89 (1987).

 It seems to me this rationale is not only unnecessary but also questionable, resting as it does upon the mere economic reality that the challenged law will require sellers in New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island to take account of the price that they must post and charge in Connecticut when setting their prices in those other States.  The difficulty with this is that innumerable valid state laws affect pricing decisions in other States  even so rudimentary a law as a maximum price regulation.  Suppose, for example, that the Connecticut Legislature had simply provided that beer could not be retailed in Connecticut above $10 a case. Sellers in those portions of New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island bordering Connecticut would have to take account of that requirement, just as sellers in those States had to take account of the Connecticut posting requirement here, because prices substantially above the maximum would cause their former in-state purchasers to drive to Connecticut and their former Connecticut purchasers to stay home.  The out-of-state impact in this particular example would not be as severe as that in the present cases, but I do not think our Commerce Clause jurisprudence should degenerate into disputes over degree of economic effect.  In any case, since this principle is both dubious and unnecessary to decide the present cases, I decline to endorse it.  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, dissenting.  In Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., <citedDecision>294 U. S. 511</citedDecision> (1935), the Court held that a New York statute setting minimum prices for milk sold in that State violated the Commerce Clause when applied to milk produced more cheaply in Vermont but imported into New York for sale.  Today the Court applies the doctrine of that case to invalidate a Connecticut statute which sets a maximum price for beer imported into *346 Connecticut from other States.  The Court's analysis seems wrong to me both as a matter of economics and as a matter of law: the maximum prices set by Connecticut in this case have a quite different effect than did the minimum prices set by New York in the <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> case, and by reason of the Twenty-first Amendment the States possess greater authority to regulate commerce in beer than they do commerce in milk.  The New York statute passed upon in <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> provided that no milk could be sold in the New York City metropolitan area unless it had been purchased from the producer for a price at least equal to the minimum specified by law. When this statute was applied to milk produced in Vermont but brought into the New York City metropolitan area for sale, the result was to require Vermont producers to give up the natural advantage which they would otherwise have obtained from the fact that the costs of production of milk in Vermont were lower than the costs of production in New York. The Court rightly held that this sort of a regulation violated the Commerce Clause because it "set a barrier to traffic between one state and another as effective as if customs duties, equal to the price differential, had been laid upon the thing transported." <citedDecision>Id., at 521</citedDecision> .  In Milk Control Board v. Eisenberg Farm Products, 306 U. S. 346 (1939), decided four years after <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> , the Court upheld a different state milk price regulation, and in so doing distinguished <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> as a case in which "this Court condemned an enactment aimed solely at interstate commerce attempting to affect and regulate the price to be paid for milk in a sister state." 306 U. S. at 353 .  The Connecticut statute here is markedly different from the New York statute condemned in <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> .  Connecticut has no motive to favor local brewers over out-of-state brewers, because there are no local brewers.  Ante, at 327, n. 2.  Its motive  unchallenged here  is to obtain from out-of-state brewers prices for Connecticut retailers and Connecticut beer drinkers as low as those charged by the brewers in neighboring States.  Connecticut does not seek to erect any *347 sort of tariff barrier to exclude out-of-state beer; its residents will drink out-of-state beer if they drink beer at all, and the State simply wishes its inhabitants to be treated as favorably as those of neighboring States by the brewers who sell interstate.  There is no "tariff wall" between Connecticut and other States; there is only a maximum price regulation with which the interstate brewer would rather not have to bother.  But that is not a sufficient reason for saying that such a regulation violates the Commerce Clause.

 These States subscribed to a standard sales contract that required distillers to guarantee that the price charged the State was no higher than the lowest price offered anywhere in the United States.  Twenty States had adopted statutes similar to the New York statute that was under challenge.  See 476 U. S., at 576 , and n. 1.  [11]  One Member of the Court concurred separately to advocate that Seagram then be overruled as a "relic of the past." Id., at 586 .  [12]  The entire Constitution was "framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not division." Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., <citedDecision>294 U. S. 511, 523</citedDecision> (1935).  [13]  The plurality in Edgar v. MITE Corp .  noted: "The limits on a State's power to enact substantive legislation are similar to the limits on the jurisdiction of state courts.  In either case, `any attempt "directly" to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction over persons or property would offend sister States and exceed the inherent limits of the State's power.' " 457 U. S., at 643 , quoting Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S., at 197 .  [14]  As a general matter, the Court has adopted a two-tiered approach to analyzing state economic regulation under the Commerce Clause.  We summarized in Brown-Forman: "When a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests, we have generally struck down the statute without further inquiry.
