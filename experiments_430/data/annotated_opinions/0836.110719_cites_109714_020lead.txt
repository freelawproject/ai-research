 Moreover, the probable-cause determination must be based on objective facts that could justify the issuance of a warrant by a magistrate and not merely on the subjective good faith of the police officers.  “ ‘[A]s we have seen, good faith is not enough to constitute probable cause.  That faith must be grounded on facts within knowledge of the [officer], which in the judgment of the court would make his faith reasonable.’ ” Id., at 161-162 (quoting Director General of Railroads v. Kastenbaum, 263 U. S. 25, 28 ).  10 *809 In short, the exception to the warrant requirement established in Carroll — the scope of which we consider in this case — applies only to searches of vehicles that are supported by probable cause.  11 In this class of cases, a search is not unreasonable if based on facts that would justify the issuance of a warrant, even though a warrant has not actually been obtained.  12 Ill The rationale justifying a warrantless search of an automobile that is believed to be transporting contraband arguably applies with equal force to any movable container that is believed to be carrying an illicit substance.  That argument, *810 however, was squarely rejected in United States v. Chadwick, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 1</citedDecision> .  <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> involved the warrantless search of a 200-pound footlocker secured with two padlocks.  Federal railroad officials in San Diego became suspicious when they noticed that a brown footlocker loaded onto a train bound for Boston was unusually heavy and leaking talcum powder, a substance often used to mask the odor of marihuana.  Narcotics agents met the train in Boston and a trained police dog signaled the presence of a controlled substance inside the footlocker.  The agents did not seize the footlocker, however, at this time; they waited until respondent Chadwick arrived and the footlocker was placed in the trunk of Chadwick’s automobile.  Before the engine was started, the officers arrested Chadwick and his two companions.  The agents then removed the footlocker to a secured place, opened it without a warrant, and discovered a large quantity of marihuana.  In a subsequent criminal proceeding, Chadwick claimed that the warrantless search of the footlocker violated the Fourth Amendment.

 The District Court rejected that argument, 13 and the Government did not pursue it on appeal.  14 Rather, the Government contended in this Court that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment applied only to searches of homes and *811 other “core” areas of privacy.  The Court unanimously rejected that contention.  15 Writing for the Court, The Chief Justice stated: “[I]f there is little evidence that the Framers intended the Warrant Clause to operate outside the home, there is no evidence at all that they intended to exclude from protection of the Clause all searches occurring outside the home.  The absence of a contemporary outcry against warrantless searches in public places was because, aside from searches incident to arrest, such warrantless searches were not a large issue in colonial America.  Thus, silence in the historical record tells us little about the Framers’ attitude toward application of the Warrant Clause to the search of respondents’ footlocker.  What we do know is that the Framers were men who focused on the wrongs of that day but who intended the Fourth Amendment to safeguard fundamental values which would far outlast the specific abuses which gave it birth.” <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 8-9</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  The Court in <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> specifically rejected the argument that the warrantless search was “reasonable” because a footlocker has some of the mobile characteristics that support warrantless searches of automobiles.  The Court recognized that “a person’s expectations of privacy in personal luggage are substantially greater than in an automobile,” <citedDecision>id., at 13</citedDecision> , and noted that the practical problems associated with the temporary detention of a piece of luggage during the period of time necessary to obtain a warrant are significantly less than those associated with the detention of an automobile.  <citedDecision>Id., at 13, n. 7</citedDecision> .  In ruling that the warrantless search of the *812 footlocker was unjustified, the Court reaffirmed the general principle that closed packages and containers may not be searched without a warrant.  Cf. Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727 ; United States v. Van Leeuwen, 397 U. S. 249 .  In sum, the Court in <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> declined to extend the rationale of the “automobile exception” to permit a warrantless search of any movable container found in a public place.  16 The facts in Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753 , were similar to those in <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> .  In Sanders , a Little Rock police officer received information from a reliable informant that Sanders would arrive at the local airport on a specified flight that afternoon carrying a green suitcase containing marihuana.  The officer went to the airport.  Sanders arrived on schedule and retrieved a green suitcase from the airline baggage service.  Sanders gave the suitcase to a waiting companion, who placed it in the trunk of a taxi.  Sanders and his companion drove off in the cab; police officers followed and stopped the taxi several blocks from the airport.  The officers opened the trunk, seized the suitcase, and searched it on the scene without a warrant.  As predicted, the suitcase contained marihuana.  The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that the warrantless search of the suitcase was impermissible under the Fourth Amendment, and this Court affirmed.  As in <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> , the mere fact that the suitcase had been placed in the trunk of the vehicle did not render the automobile exception of Carroll applicable; the police had probable cause to seize the suitcase before it was placed in the trunk of the cab and did not *813 have probable cause to search the taxi itself.  17 Since the suitcase had been placed in the trunk, no danger existed that its contents could have been secreted elsewhere in the vehicle.  18 As The Chief Justice noted in his opinion concurring in the judgment: “Because the police officers had probable cause to believe that respondent’s green suitcase contained marihuana before it was placed in the trunk of the taxicab, their duty to obtain a search warrant before opening it is clear under United States v. Chadwick, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1977).  .  .  .  “.  .  .  Here, as in <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> , it was the luggage being transported by respondent at the time of the arrest, not the automobile in which it was being carried, that was the suspected locus of the contraband.  The relationship between the automobile and the contraband was purely coincidental, as in <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> .  The fact that the suitcase was resting in the trunk of the automobile at the time of respondent’s arrest does not turn this into an ‘automobile’ exception case. The Court need say no more.” 442 U. S., at 766-767 .  The Court in Sanders did not, however, rest its decision solely on the authority of <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> .  In rejecting the State’s *814 argument that the warrantless search of the suitcase was justified on the ground that it had been taken from an automobile lawfully stopped on the street, the Court broadly suggested that a warrantless search of a container found in an automobile could never be sustained as part of a warrantless search of the automobile itself.  19 The Court did not suggest that it mattered whether probable cause existed to search the entire vehicle.  It is clear, however, that in neither <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> nor Sanders did the police have probable cause to search the vehicle or anything within it except the footlocker in the former case and the green suitcase in the latter.  Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 , however, was a case in which suspicion was not directed at a specific container.  In that case the Court for the first time was forced to consider whether police officers who are entitled to conduct a warrantless search of an automobile stopped on a public roadway may open a container found within the vehicle.  In the early morning of January 5, 1975, police officers stopped Robbins’ station wagon because he was driving erratically.  Robbins got out of the car, but later returned to obtain the vehicle’s registration papers.  When he opened the car door, the officers smelled marihuana smoke.  One of the officers searched Robbins and discovered a vial of liquid; in a search of the interior of the car the officer found marihuana.

 Robbins was charged with various drug offenses and moved to suppress the contents of the plastic packages.  The California Court of Appeal held that “[s]earch of the automobile was proper when the officers learned that appellant was smoking marijuana when they stopped him” 20 and that the warrantless search of the packages was justified because “the contents of the packages could have been inferred from their outward appearance, so that appellant could not have held a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the contents.” People v. Robbins, 103 Cal. App. 3d 34, 40 , 162 Cal. Rptr. 780, 783 (1980).  This Court reversed.  Writing for a plurality, Justice Stewart rejected the argument that the outward appearance of the packages precluded Robbins from having a reasonable expectation of privacy in their contents.  He also squarely rejected the argument that there is a constitutional distinction between searches of luggage and searches of “less worthy” containers.  Justice Stewart reasoned that all containers are equally protected by the Fourth Amendment unless their contents are in plain view.  The plurality concluded that the warrantless search was impermissible because <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> and Sanders had established that “a closed piece of luggage found in a lawfully searched car is constitutionally protected to the same extent as are closed pieces of luggage found anywhere else.” 453 U. S., at 425 .  In an opinion concurring in the judgment, JUSTICE POWELL, the author of the Court’s opinion in Sanders , stated that “[t]he plurality’s approach strains the rationales of our prior cases and imposes substantial burdens on law enforcement without vindicating any significant values of privacy.” 453 *816 U. S., at 429 .  21 He noted that possibly “the controlling question should be the scope of the automobile exception to the warrant requirement,” id., at 435 , and explained that under that view “when the police have probable cause to search an automobile, rather than only to search a particular container that fortuitously is located in it, the exigencies that allow the police to search the entire automobile without a warrant support the warrantless search of every container found therein.  See post, at 451, and n. 13 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This analysis is entirely consistent with the holdings in <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> and Sanders , neither of which is an ‘automobile case,’ because the police there had probable cause to search the double-locked footlocker and the suitcase respectively before either came near an automobile.” Ibid. The parties in Robbins had not pressed that argument, how *817 ever, and Justice Powell concluded that institutional constraints made it inappropriate to reexamine basic doctrine without full adversary presentation.  He concurred in the judgment, since it was supported — although not compelled— by the Court’s opinion in Sanders , and stated that a future case might present a better opportunity for thorough consideration of the basic principles in this troubled area.  That case has arrived.  Unlike <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> and Sanders , in this case police officers had probable cause to search respondent’s entire vehicle.  22 Unlike Robbins, in this case the parties have squarely addressed the question whether, in the course of a legitimate warrantless search of an automobile, police are entitled to open containers found within the vehicle.  We now address that question.  Its answer is determined by the scope of the search that is authorized by the exception to the warrant requirement set forth in Carroll .  IV In Carroll itself, the whiskey that the prohibition agents seized was not in plain view.  It was discovered only after an officer opened the rumble seat and tore open the upholstery of the lazyback.  The Court did not find the scope of the search unreasonable.
**Lead Opinion**
 In its application of Carroll , this Court in fact has sustained warrantless searches of containers found during a lawful search of an automobile.  In Husty v. United States, 282 U. S. 694 , the Court upheld a warrantless seizure of whiskey found during a search of an automobile, some of which was discovered in “whiskey bags” that could have contained other goods.  23 In Scher v. United States, 305 U. S. 251 , federal of- *819 fleers seized and searched packages of unstamped liquor found in the trunk of an automobile searched without a warrant.  As described by a police officer who participated in the search: “I turned the handle and opened the trunk and found the trunk completely filled with packages wrapped in brown paper, and tied with twine; I think somewhere around thirty packages, each one containing six bottles.” 24 In these cases it was not contended that police officers needed a warrant to open the whiskey bags or to unwrap the brown paper packages.  These decisions nevertheless “have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench.” Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (Marshall, C. J.).  The fact that no such argument was even made illuminates the profession’s understanding of the scope of the search permitted under Carroll .  Indeed, prior to the decisions in <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> and Sanders , courts routinely had held that containers and packages found during a legitimate warrantless search of an automobile also could be searched without a warrant.  25 *820 As we have stated, the decision in Carroll was based on the Court’s appraisal of practical considerations viewed in the perspective of history.  It is therefore significant that the practical consequences of the Carroll decision would be largely nullified if the permissible scope of a warrantless search of an automobile did not include containers and packages found inside the vehicle.  Contraband goods rarely are strewn across the trunk or floor of a car; since by their very nature such goods must be withheld from public view, they rarely can be placed in an automobile unless they are enclosed within some form of container.  26 The Court in Carroll held that “contraband goods concealed and illegally transported in an automobile or other vehicle may be searched for without a warrant.” 267 U. S., at 153 (emphasis added).  As we noted in Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98, 104 , the decision in Carroll “merely relaxed the requirements for a warrant on grounds of practicability.” It neither broadened nor limited the scope of a lawful search based on probable cause.  A lawful search of fixed premises generally extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found and is not limited by the possibility that separate acts of en *821 try or opening may be required to complete the search.

 It gives the owner of an automobile or other vehicle seized under Section 26, in absence of probable cause, a right to have restored to him the automobile, it protects him under the Weeks [Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 ] and Amos [Amos v. United States, 255 U. S. 313 ] cases from use of the liquor as evidence against him, and it subjects the officer making the seizures to damages.  On the other hand, in a case showing probable cause, the Government and its officials are given the opportunity which they should have, to make the investigation necessary to trace reasonably suspected contraband goods and to seize them.” 267 U. S., at 156 .  The District Court noted: “In this case, there was no nexus between the search and the automobile, merely a coincidence.  The challenged search in this case was one of a footlocker, not an automobile.  The search took place not in an automobile, but in [the federal building].  The only connection that the automobile had to this search was that, prior to its seizure, the footlocker was placed on the floor of an automobile’s open trunk.” United States v. Chadwick, 393 F. Supp. 763, 772 (Mass. 1975).  This Court specifically noted: “The Government does not contend that the footlocker’s brief contact with Chadwick’s car makes this an automobile search, but it is argued that the rationale of our automobile search cases *811 demonstrates the reasonableness of permitting warrantless searches of luggage; the Government views such luggage as analagous to motor vehicles for Fourth Amendment purposes.” <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 11-12</citedDecision> .  See <citedDecision>id., at 17</citedDecision> (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  The Court concluded that there is a significant difference between the seizure of a sealed package and a subsequent search of its contents; the search of the container in that case was “a far greater intrusion into Fourth Amendment values than the impoundment of the footlocker.” <citedDecision>Id., at 14, n. 8</citedDecision> .  A temporary seizure of a package or piece of luggage often may be accomplished without as significant an intrusion upon the individual — and without as great a burden on the police — as in the case of the seizure of an automobile.  See n. 9, supra. The Arkansas Supreme Court carefully reviewed the facts of the case and concluded: “The information supplied to the police by the confidential informant is adequate to support the State’s claim that the police had probable cause to believe that appellant’s green suitcase contained a controlled substance when the police confiscated the suitcase and opened it.” Sanders v. State, 262 Ark. 595, 599 , 559 S. W. 2d 704, 706 (1977).  The court also noted: “The evidence in this case supports the conclusion that the relationship between the suitcase and the taxicab is coincidental.” Id., at 600, n. 2 , 559 S. W. 2d, at 706, n. 2 .  Moreover, none of the practical difficulties associated with the detention of a vehicle on a public highway that made the immediate search in Carroll reasonable could justify an immediate search of the suitcase, since the officers had no interest in detaining the taxi or its driver.  The Court stated that “the extent to which the Fourth Amendment applies to containers and other parcels depends not at all upon whether they are seized from an automobile.” 442 U. S., at 764, n. 13 .  This general rule was limited only by the observation that “[n]ot all containers and packages found by police during the course of a search will deserve the full protection of the Fourth Amendment.
