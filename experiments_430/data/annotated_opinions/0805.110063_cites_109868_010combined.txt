 its use cannot be limited to the citizens of one State to the exclusion of citizens of another State." Geer v. Connecticut, supra, at 538 (Field, J., dissenting).  Reversed.  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.  This Court's seeming preoccupation in recent years with laws relating to wildlife must, I suspect, appear curious to casual observers of this institution.  [1] It is no more curious, however, than this Court's recent pronouncements on the validity of Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 (1896).  For less than one year ago we unreservedly reaffirmed the principles announced in Geer v. Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, <citedDecision>436 U. S. 371, 386</citedDecision> (1978).  Today, the Court overrules that decision.  Because I disagree with the Court's overruling of Geer and holding that Oklahoma's law relating to the sale of minnows violates the Commerce Clause, I dissent.  In its headlong rush to overrule Geer , the Court characterizes that decision as "rest[ing] on the holding that no interstate commerce was involved." Ante, at 327.  It is true that one of the rationales relied on by the Geer Court was that the State could exercise its power to control the killing and ownership of animals ferae naturae to prohibit such game *340 from leaving the borders of the State and thus prevent the game from ever becoming the objects of interstate commerce.  161 U. S., at 530-532 .
**Combined Opinion**
 It is obvious that the Court has simply set this theory up as a sort of strawman to facilitate the toppling of a decision which, in other respects, enunciates principles that have remained valid and vital, albeit somewhat refined, at least until today.  [4] The Court in Geer expressed the view derived from Roman law that the wild fish and game located within the territorial limits of a State are the common property of its citizens and that the State, as a kind of trustee, may exercise this common "ownership" for the benefit of its citizens.  161 U. S., at 529 .  Admittedly, a State does not "own" the wild creatures within its borders in any conventional sense of the word.  [5] Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n supra, at 386; Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265, 284 (1977); Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 401-402 (1948); Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 434 (1920).  But the concept expressed by the "ownership" doctrine is not obsolete.  <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, supra, at 392 (BURGER, C. J., concurring).  This Court long has recognized that the ownership *342 language of Geer and similar cases is simply a shorthand way of describing a State's substantial interest in preserving and regulating the exploitation of the fish and game and other natural resources within its boundaries for the benefit of its citizens.  <citedDecision>436 U. S., at 386</citedDecision> ; Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 284; Toomer v. Witsell, supra, at 402 .  In recognition of this important state interest, the Court has upheld a variety of regulations designed to conserve and maintain the natural resources of a State.  See, e. g., <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, supra ; Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440 (1960); Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545 (1924); Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 138 (1914); Geer v. Connecticut, supra ; Manchester v. Massachusetts, 139 U. S. 240 (1891); McCready v. Virginia, 94 U. S. 391 (1877); Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71 (1855).  To be sure, a State's power to preserve and regulate wildlife within its borders is not absolute.  [6] But the State is accorded wide latitude in fashioning regulations appropriate for protection of its wildlife.  Unless the regulation directly conflicts with a federal statute or treaty, Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 283-285; Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529, 546 (1976); Missouri v. Holland, supra, at 434 ; allocates access in a manner that violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, 334 U. S. 410 (1948); or represents a naked attempt to discriminate against out-of-state enterprises in favor of in-state businesses unrelated to any purpose of conservation, Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1, 13 (1928), the State's special interest in preserving its wildlife *343 should prevail.  And this is true no matter how "Balkanized" the resulting pattern of commercial activity.  [7] The Oklahoma law at issue in this case serves the special interest of the State, as representative of its citizens, in preserving and regulating exploitation of free-swimming minnows found within its waters.  "[T]he law serve[s] to protect against the depletion of minnows in Oklahoma's natural streams through commercial exportation." 572 P. 2d 573, 575 (Okla. Crim. App. 1977).  Oklahoma's statutory scheme may not be the most artfully designed to accomplish its purpose.  [8] *344 But the range of regulations that a State may adopt under these circumstances is extremely broad, particularly where, as here, the burden on interstate commerce is, at most, minimal.  See Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S., at 288 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, supra, at 552; cf. <citedDecision>Baldwin</citedDecision> v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, <citedDecision>436 U. S., at 391</citedDecision> ; Kleppe v. New Mexico, supra, at 545 .  Contrary to the view of the Court, I do not think that Oklahoma's regulation of the commercial exploitation of natural minnows either discriminates against out-of-state enterprises in favor of local businesses or that it burdens the interstate commerce in minnows.  At least, no such showing has been made on the record before us.  Cf. Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 154 (1963).  This is not a case where a State's regulation permits residents to export naturally seined minnows but prohibits nonresidents from so doing.  No person is allowed to export natural minnows for sale outside of Oklahoma; the statute is evenhanded in its application.  See Okla. Stat., Tit. 29, ยง 4-115 (B) (Supp. 1978).

 [15]  "In more recent years .  .  .  the Court has recognized that the States' interest in regulating and controlling those things they claim to `own,' including wildlife, is by no means absolute.  States may not compel the confinement of the benefits of their resources, even their wildlife, to their own people whenever such hoarding and confinement impedes interstate commerce.  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928); Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923); West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911)." Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, <citedDecision>436 U. S. 371, 385-386</citedDecision> (1978).  [16]  See, e. g., Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 , 285 n. 21 (1977).  [17]  "[W]hatever [a State's] ultimate purpose, it may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently." Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 626-627 .  [18]  See n. 1, supra. [19]  Section 4-115 (B) does not apply to persons transporting three dozen or less natural minnows outside the State.  See n. 1, supra. [20]  In its brief, Oklahoma argues, apparently for the first time, that the discrimination against out-of-state sales of natural minnows is justified because minnows purchased in the State are more likely to be used for bait in state waters.  Brief for Appellee 3.  The State contends that minnows "returned" to state waters as bait do not upset the ecological balance as much as those that never "return." The late appearance of this argument and the total absence of any record support for the questionable factual assumptions that underlie it give it the flavor of a post hoc rationalization.  The State's bare assertion is certainly inadequate to survive the scrutiny invoked by the facial discrimination of ยง 4-115 (B).  In any case, Oklahoma itself concedes that the "return" of natural minnows as bait is irrelevant to most aspects of preserving ecological balance.  Brief for Appellee 4.  [1]  See, e. g., TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153 (1978) (snail darters); Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, <citedDecision>436 U. S. 371</citedDecision> (1978) (elk); Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 (1977) (menhaden); Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529 (1976) (wild horses and burros).  [2]  "The fact that internal commerce may be distinct from interstate commerce, destroys the whole theory upon which the argument of the plaintiff in error proceeds.  The power of the State to control the killing of and ownership in game being admitted, the commerce in game, which the state law permitted, was necessarily only internal commerce, since the restriction that it should not become the subject of external commerce went along with the grant and was a part of it." Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S., at 532 .  [3]  The Court in Geer assigned an alternative basis for its decision.  The Court held that a State, in the exercise of its police power, could act to preserve for its people a valuable food supply, even though interstate commerce was remotely and indirectly affected.  "Aside from the authority of the State, derived from the common ownership of game and the trust for the benefit of its people which the State exercises in relation thereto, there is another view of the power of the State in regard to the property in game, which is equally conclusive.
