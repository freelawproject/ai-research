 Could not the purpose of the prohibition be wholly thwarted if this avenue of attack were left open?  Certainly there is nothing in the words of the prohibition indicating that it is directed against one legislative power and not another; and in our opinion due regard for its spirit and principle requires that it be taken as directed against them all.” .  Mr. Justice Holmes wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brandéis joined.  With that expression his opposition to the decision ended.  Two years later, in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501 , writing for the Court, invalidating a state tax upon- net income of a lessee from sales of his share of oil and gas received under leases of restricted Indian land, he said (p. 505): “In cases where the principal is' absolutely immune from interference an inquiry is allowed into the sources from which net income is derived and if a part of it comes from-,such a source the tax is pro tanto void; Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429 ; 158 U. S. 601 ; a.rule lately illustrated by Evans v. Gore .  .  .” And in that case he relied on the truth, as put by Chief Justice Marshall in M’Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431 , that “the power to tax involves the power to destroy.” He quoted (p,-505) with approval from Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522 , the statement of the opinion (p. 530) that “A tax upon the leases is a tax upon’the power to make them, and could be used to destroy - the power, to make them.” 15 *295 Miles v. Graham (1925), <citedDecision>268 U. S. 501</citedDecision> , held invalid § 213 (a), Revenue Act of 1918, (condemned in Evans v. Gore) when applied to compensation of Judge Graham, *296 appointed after its enactment.  Mr. Justice Holmes joined in the decision.  Mr. Justice Brandéis merely noted dissent.  In the course of the opinion, we said: “Does the circumstance that defendant in error’s appointment came after the taxing Act require a different view concerning his right to exemption ?  The answer depends upon the import of the word ‘compensation’ in the constitutional provision.  “The words and history of the clause indicate that the purpose was to impose upon Congress the duty definitely to declare what sum shall be received by each judge out of the public funds and the times for payment.  When this duty has been complied with the amount specified becomes the compensation which is protected against diminution during his continuance in office.

 No "judge is required to pay a definite percentage of his salary, but all are commanded to return, as a part of ‘gross income,’ ‘the compensation received as such’ from the United States.  From the ‘gross income’ various deductions and credits are allowed, as for interest paid, contributions or gifts made, personal exemptions varying with family relations, etc., and upon the net result assessment is made.  The plain purpose was to require all judges to return their compensation as an item of ‘gross income,’ and to tax this as other salaries.  This is forbidden by the Constitution.  *297 “The power of Congress definitely to fix the compensation to be received at stated intervals by judges thereafter appointed is clear.  It is equally clear, we think, that there is no power to tax a judge of a court of the United States on account of the salary prescribed for him by law ” In O’Donoghue v. United States (1933), 289 U. S. 516 , we construed the Act of June 30, 1932 16 reducing the salaries of all judges “except judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office.” We there held that the supreme court and court of- appeals of the District of Columbia were constitutional courts and therefore that the judges of those courts were excepted from the salary reduction.  We cited the authorities, adopted the reasoning, and reaffirmed the conclusions on which rest the Court’s judgments in Evans v. Gore and <citedDecision>Miles</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Graham</citedDecision> .  And see Booth v. United States, 291 U. S. 339 .  Evidently the, Court intends to destroy the decision in Evans v. Gore .  Without suggesting that there is any distinction between that case and <citedDecision>Miles</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Graham</citedDecision> , it declares that the latter “cannot survive.” But the decision of today fails to deal with, much less to detract from the reasoning of those cases. The opinion would imply that the letter of Chief Justice Taney to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the separate opinion of Mr. Justice Field in the Pollock case were treated as having weight as' judicial decisions.  But nowhere has that ever been suggested.  However,, all who are familiar with our judicial history know .  that entitled to great respect are the reasoned conclusions of these eminent American jurists as to the true, intent and meaning of the Constitution of the United States.  And similarly worthy of attention are, the opinions of the Attorneys General and other public officials following the reasoning of Chief Justice Taney. *298 Now the Court cites, as if entitled to prevail against those well-sustained opinions and the deliberate judgments of this Court, opposing views — if indeed upon examination they reasonably may be so deemed — of English speaking judges in foreign countries.  It refers, footnote 6, to the decision of the Privy Council in Judges v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan (1937), 2 D. L. R. 209, construing income tax statutes of Saskatchewan.  Neither the Dominion nor the Province has any law forbidding diminution of compensation of judges while in office and that decision has nothing to do with the question before us.
