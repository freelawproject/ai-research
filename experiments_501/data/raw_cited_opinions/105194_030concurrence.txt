<p id="b212-6">Had I been here in 1949 when <em>Wolf </em>was decided, I would have applied the doctrine of <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U. S. 383 (1914), to the states. But the Court refused to do so then, and it still refuses today. Thus <em>Wolf </em>remains the law and, as such, is entitled to the respect of this Court’s membership.</p>
<p id="b212-7">Of course, we could sterilize the rule announced in <em>Wolf </em>by adopting a case-by-case approach to due process, in which inchoate notions of propriety concerning local police conduct guide our decisions. But this makes for such uncertainty and unpredictability that it would be impossible to foretell — other than by guesswork — just how brazen the invasion of the intimate privacies of one’s home must be in order to shock itself into the protective arms of the Constitution. In truth, the practical result of this <em>ad hoc </em>approach is simply that when five Justices are sufficiently revolted by local police action, a conviction is overturned and a guilty man may go free. <em>Rochin </em>bears witness to this. We may thus vindicate the abstract principle of due process, but we do not shape the conduct of local police one whit; unpredictable reversals on dissimilar fact situations are not likely to curb the zeal of those police and prosecutors' who may be intent on racking up a high percentage of successful prosecu<page-number citation-index="1" label="139">*139</page-number>tions. I do not believe that the extension of such a vacillating course beyond the clear cases of physical coercion and brutality, such as <em>Rochin, </em>would serve a useful purpose.</p>
<p id="b213-5">In light of the “incredible” activity of the police here, it is with great reluctance that I follow <em>Wolf. </em>Perhaps strict adherence to the tenor of that decision may produce needed converts for its extinction. Thus I merely concur in the judgment of affirmance.</p>
