**Lead Opinion**
 See generally Note, Civil Disabilities of Felons, 53 Va. L. Rev. 403 (1967).  See 28 U. S. C. §§ 2241 , 2242, 2243, 2244, 2245, 2249, 2252, 2254.  See 9 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 108-125 (1926).  E. g., Article 39 of the Magna Carta (see 9 W. Holdsworth, at 112-125).  The federal habeas corpus statute grants jurisdiction to inquire into violations of the United States Constitution.  If there has been, or will be, an unconditional release from custody before inquiry can be made into the legality of detention, it has been held that there is no habeas corpus jurisdiction.  See *239 Parker v. Ellis, supra, at 582, n. 8 (WARREN, C. J., dissenting); Ex parte Baez, 177 U. S. 378 (1900); United States ex rel. Rivera v. Reeves, <citedDecision>246 F. Supp. 599</citedDecision> (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1965); Burnett v. Gladden, 228 F. Supp. 527 (D. C. D. Ore. 1964).  Petitioner was convicted in 1960.  He took his case through the state appellate process, and this Court denied a writ of certiorari in March 1963.  372 U. S. 948 .  In June 1963 petitioner began his quest for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts.  The District Court denied the petition without prejudice, suggesting, in view of what the judge thought was the unsettled state of New York law, that petitioner reapply to the state courts.  See 28 U. S. C. § 2254 .
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring. Although we joined the per curiam decision in Parker v. Ellis, 362 U. S. 574 , we are now persuaded that what the Court there decided was wrong insofar as it held that even though a man be in custody when he initiates *243 a habeas corpus proceeding, the statutory power of the federal courts to proceed to a final adjudication of his claims depends upon his remaining in custody. Consequently we concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court. Mr. Justice Harlan also notes that his views upon the issue discussed in his separate concurring opinion in Parker, id., at 576 , have not changed.
