 .  against introduction of evidence seized without probable cause.” The Amendment is designed to prevent, not simply to redress, unlawful police action.  In any event, we cannot join in characterizing the invasion *767 of privacy that results from a top-to-bottom search of a man’s house as “minor.” And we can see no reason why, simply because some interference with an individual’s privacy and freedom of movement has lawfully taken place, further intrusions should automatically be allowed despite the absence of a warrant that the Fourth Amendment would otherwise require.  Although the warrant was issued at 10:39 a. m. and the arrest was not made until late in the afternoon, the State suggests that the delay is accounted for by normal police procedures and by the heavy workload of the officer in charge.  In addition, that officer testified that he and his colleagues went to the petitioner’s house “to keep from approaching him at his place of business to cause him any problem there.” See, e. g., J. Landynski, Search and Seizure and the Supreme Court 87-117 (1966); Way, Increasing Scope of Search Incidental to Arrest, 1959 Wash. U. L. Q. 261; Note, Scope Limitations for Searches Incident to Arrest, 78 Yale L. J. 433 (1969); Note, The Supreme Court 1966 Term, 81 Harv. L. Rev. 69 , 117-122 (1967).  Cf. Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg.

The State has made various subsidiary contentions, including arguments that it would have been unduly burdensome to obtain a warrant specifying the coins to be seized and that introduction of the fruits of the search was harmless error.  We reject those contentions as being without merit.

*769 Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring.  I join the Court’s opinion with these remarks concerning a factor to which the Court has not alluded.  The only thing that has given me pause in voting to overrule Harris and Rabinowitz is that as a result of Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), and Ker v. California, <citedDecision>374 U. S. 23</citedDecision> (1963), every change in Fourth Amendment law must now be obeyed by state officials facing widely different problems of local law enforcement.  We simply do not know the extent to which cities and towns across the Nation are prepared to administer the greatly expanded warrant system which will be required by today’s decision; nor can we say with assurance that in each and every local situation, the warrant requirement plays an essential role in the protection of those fundamental liberties protected against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Thus, one is now faced with the dilemma, envisioned in my separate opinion in Ker, <citedDecision>374 U. S., at 45-46</citedDecision> , of choosing between vindicating sound Fourth Amendment principles at the possible expense of state concerns, long recognized to be consonant with the Fourteenth Amendment before Mapp and <citedDecision>Ker</citedDecision> came on the books, or diluting the Federal Bill of Rights in the interest of leaving the States at least some elbow room in their methods of criminal law enforcement.  No comparable dilemma exists, of course, with respect to the impact of today’s decision within the federal system itself.  This federal-state factor has not been an easy one for me to resolve, but in the last analysis I cannot in good conscience vote to perpetuate bad Fourth Amendment law. I add only that this case, together with Benton v. Maryland, post, p. 784, North Carolina v. Pearce, ante, p. 711, and Simpson v. Rice, ante, p. 711, all decided *770 today, serve to point up, as few other cases have, the profound changes that the “incorporation doctrine” has wrought both in the workings of our federal system and upon the adjudicative processes of this Court.

 Accord, that year, McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 (1948) (gambling game seen through transom before entry).  Less than two years later, however, the Court returned to the Harris rule in United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950), where the Court held that the reasonableness of a search does not depend upon the practicability of obtaining a search warrant, and that the fact of a valid arrest is relevant to reasonableness.  Trupiano was pro tanto overruled.  Such rapid reversals have occurred before, 1 but they are rare.  Here there had been two about-faces, one following hard upon the other.  Justice Frankfurter objected in this language: “Especially ought the Court not reenforce needlessly the instabilities of our day by giving fair ground for the belief that Law is the expression of *772 chance — for instance, of unexpected changes in the Court’s composition and the contingencies in the choice of successors.” 339 U. S., at 86 .  Since that time, the rule of Weeks, Marron, Harris, and Rabinowitz has clearly been the law. E. g., Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., writing for the Court) ; Ker v. California, <citedDecision>374 U. S. 23</citedDecision> (1963).  2 II.  The rule which has prevailed, but for very brief or doubtful periods of aberration, is that a search incident to an arrest may extend to those areas under the control of the defendant and where items subject to constitutional seizure may be found. The justification for this rule must, under the language of the Fourth Amendment, lie in the reasonableness of the rule.  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 9 (1968); Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 (1968); Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 222 (1960).  The Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” In terms, then, the Court must decide whether a given search is reasonable.  The Amendment does not proscribe “warrantless searches” but instead it proscribes “unrea *773 sonable searches” and this Court has never held nor does the majority today assert that warrantless searches are necessarily unreasonable.  Applying this reasonableness test to the area of searches incident to arrests, one thing is clear at the outset.

 Jamison v. United States, post, p. 986.  See also my dissent in Shipley v. California, post, p. 821.  The judgment of Congress is that federal law enforcement officers may reasonably make warrantless arrests upon probable cause, and no judicial experience suggests that this judgment is infirm.  Indeed, past cases suggest precisely the contrary conclusion.  The validity of federal arrests was long governed by state law, United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 589-592 (1948), and no requirement that warrants be sought whenever there is time to do so was imposed either by common-law history 14 or by decisions of this Court. This Court has upheld an execu *779 tive arrest warrant for deportation, permitting the arrest to occur without prior judicial scrutiny, Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217 (1960).  And this Court has regularly affirmed the validity of warrantless arrests without any indication whatever that there was no time to get a warrant, and indeed where all the circumstances pointed to the opposite conclusion.  E. g., Ker v. California, <citedDecision>374 U. S. 23</citedDecision> (1963); Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307 (1959).  The lower federal courts have certainly been of the view that warrants are unnecessary even where there is time to obtain them.  Dailey v. United States, 261 F. 2d 870 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 359 U. S. 969 (1959) (statutory warrantless arrest by federal narcotics agents); Smith v. United States, 103 U. S. App. D. C. 48, 52, 254 F. 2d 751, 755 , cert. denied, 357 U. S. 937 (1958); Mills v. United States, 90 U. S. App. D. C. 365, 196 F. 2d 600 , cert. denied, 344 U. S. 826 (1952) (sub silentio).  In light of the uniformity of judgment of the Congress, past judicial decisions, and common practice rejecting the proposition that arrest warrants are essential wherever it is practicable to get them, the conclusion is inevitable that such arrests and accompanying searches are reasonable, at least until experience teaches the contrary.  It must very often be the case that by the time probable cause to arrest a man is accumulated, the man is aware of police interest in him or for other good reasons is on the verge of flight.  Moreover, it will likely be very difficult to determine the probability of his flight.  Given this situation, it may be best in all cases simply to allow the arrest if there is probable cause, especially since that issue can be determined very shortly after the arrest.
**Combined Opinion**
 The search here went far beyond the petitioner's person and the area from within which he might have obtained either a weapon or something that could have been used as evidence against him.  There was no constitutional justification, in the absence of a search warrant, for extending the search beyond that area.  The scope of the search was, therefore, "unreasonable" under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the petitioner's conviction cannot stand.  [16] Reversed.  *769 MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, dissenting.  Few areas of the law have been as subject to shifting constitutional standards over the last 50 years as that of the search "incident to an arrest." There has been a remarkable instability in this whole area, which has seen at least four major shifts in emphasis.  Today's opinion makes an untimely fifth.  In my view, the Court should not now abandon the old rule.
