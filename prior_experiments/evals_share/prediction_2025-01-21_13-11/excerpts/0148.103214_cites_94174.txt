Case of interest: Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. (1895)
-----------------------
statutory origins, are filled by separate nominations and confirmations, and enjoy different emoluments. A new appointee to a circuit court of appeals occupies a new office no less when he is taken from the district bench than when he is drawn from the bar.
By means of § 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932, Congress sought to avoid, at least in part, the consequences of Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245. That case, decided on June 1, 1920, ruled for the first time that a provision requiring the compensation received by the judges of the United States to be included in the "gross income" from which the net income is to be computed, although merely part of a taxing measure of general, non-discriminatory application to all earners of incomes, is contrary to Article III, § 1, of the Constitution which provides that the "Compensation" of the "Judges" "shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office." See also the separate opinion of Mr. Justice Field in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., <caseOfInterest>157 U.S. 429</caseOfInterest>, 586, 604 et seq. To be sure, in a letter to Secretary Chase, Chief Justice Taney expressed similar views.[1] In doing so, he merely gave his extra-judicial opinion, asserting at the same time that the question could not be adjudicated.[2] Chief Justice Taney's vigorous views were shared by Attorney General Hoar.[3] Thereafter, both the Treasury Department[4] and Congress[5]*281 acted upon this construction of the Constitution. However, the meaning which Evans v. Gore imputed to the history which explains Article III, § 1, was contrary to the way in which it was read by other English-speaking courts.[6] The decision met wide and steadily growing disfavor from legal scholarship and professional opinion.[7]Evans v. Gore itself was rejected by most of the courts before whom the matter came after that decision.[8]
Having regard to these circumstances, the question immediately before us is whether Congress exceeded its constitutional power in providing that United States judges *282 appoin

ce 1862, said:[9]
"The Constitution of the United States has placed several limitations upon the general power [of taxation], and . . . some of them are implied. One of its provisions is that neither the President of the United States (Art. II, sec. 1, par 6), nor a judge of the Supreme or inferior courts (Art III, sec. 1), shall have his salary diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, or during his continuance in office. It is very clear that *290 when Congress, during the late [Civil] war, levied an income tax, and placed it as well upon the salaries of the President and the judges of the courts as those of other people, that it was a diminution of them to just that extent."
Although the Income Tax Act of 1894 said nothing about the compensation of the judges, Mr. Justice Field construed § 33[10] to tax that compensation and assigned that ground among others for joining in the decision that the Act was unconstitutional. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., <caseOfInterest>157 U.S. 429</caseOfInterest>, 604-606. Mr. Justice Field, who was confirmed the day this Court ordered Chief Justice Taney's letter entered on its records, had taken his place upon this bench at the beginning of the following term. His opinion recited the facts of that incident and quoted extensively from the letter, which was printed as an appendix to the volume of the reports containing the opinions in the Pollock case. 157 U.S. 701. The Justice ended his discussion of the matter by stating his belief, based on information, that the opinion of Attorney General Hoar had been followed ever since without question by the Treasury. And, upon reargument of the cause, Attorney General Olney said in his brief: "There has never been a doubt since the opinion of Attorney General Hoar that the salaries of the President and judges were exempt."
The Revenue Acts of 1913[11] and 1916,[12] being the first two after adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, expressly *291 excluded from gross income the compensation of judges then i

m of a tax? Could not the purpose of the prohibition be wholly thwarted if this avenue of attack were left open? Certainly there is nothing in the words of the prohibition indicating that it is directed against one legislative power and not another; and in our opinion due regard for its spirit and principle requires that it be taken as directed against them all."
Mr. Justice Holmes wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brandeis joined. With that expression his opposition to the decision ended. Two years later, in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U.S. 501, writing for the Court, invalidating a state tax upon net income of a lessee from sales of his share of oil and gas received under leases of restricted Indian land, he said (p. 505): "In cases where the principal is absolutely immune from interference an inquiry is allowed into the sources from which net income is derived and if a part of it comes from such a source the tax is pro tanto void; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., <caseOfInterest>157 U.S. 429</caseOfInterest>; 158 U.S. 601; a rule lately illustrated by Evans v. Gore . . ." And in that case he relied on the truth, as put by Chief Justice Marshall in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431, that "the power to tax involves the power to destroy." He quoted (p. 505) with approval from Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U.S. 522, the statement of the opinion (p. 530) that "A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to destroy the power to make them."[15]
*295 Miles v. Graham (1925), 268 U.S. 501, held invalid § 213 (a), Revenue Act of 1918, (condemned in Evans v. Gore) when applied to compensation of Judge Graham, *296 appointed after its enactment. Mr. Justice Holmes joined in the decision. Mr. Justice Brandeis merely noted dissent.
In the course of the opinion, we said:
"Does the circumstance that defendant in error's appointment came after the taxing Act require a different view concerning his right to exemption? The answer depends upon the import of the word

ence. And, from the beginning, statesmen and jurists have agreed that the clause forbids diminution of judges' compensation by any form of legislation. The clause in question is plain: no exception is expressed; none may be implied. Its unqualified command should be given effect.
For one convinced that the judgment now given is wrong, it is impossible to acquiesce or merely to note dissent. And so this opinion is written to indicate the grounds of opposition and to evidence regret that another landmark has been removed.
I am of opinion that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed.
