 Id., §4086.  Secretary of State Blaine referred to these consular powers as “greater than ever the Roman law conferred on the pro-consuls of the empire, to an officer who, under the terms of the commitment of this astounding trust, is practically irresponsible.” S. Exec. Doc. No. 21, 47th Cong., 1st Sess. 4.  Seward, at a time when he was Consul-General, declared: “[t]here is no reason, excepting the absence of appropriate legislation, why American citizens in China, charged with grave offenses, should not have the privilege of a trial by jury as elsewhere throughout the world where the institution of civilization prevails.” Id., at 7.

Bidwell, 182 U. S. 244 , the first of the “Insular Cases” was decided over vigorous dissents from Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, joined by Justices Harlan, Brewer, and Peckham, and from Mr. Justice Harlan separately.  The four dissenters took the position that all the restraints of the Bill of Rights and of other parts of the Constitution were applicable to the United States Government wherever it acted.  This was the position which the Court had consistently followed prior to the “Insular Cases.” See, e. g., Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 ; Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540 .

 .  .  the trial should be in our courts.” I see no reason for not applying the same principle to any case where a civilian *78 dependent stands trial on pain of life itself.  The number of such cases would appear to be so negligible that the practical problems of affording the defendant a civilian trial would not present insuperable problems.  On this narrow ground I concur in the result in these cases. 50 U. S. C. § 552 (11).  The cases were argued on May 3, 1956, and decided on June 11, 1956.  Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 244 ; Hawaii v.
