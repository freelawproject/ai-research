 e., it had determined that the set-aside was “a necessary means of advancing a compelling governmental interest” — and had done so correctly.  448 U. S., at 496 (concurring opinion).  Justice Stewart (joined by then-Justice Rehnquist) dissented, arguing that the Constitution required the Federal Government to meet the same strict standard as the States when enacting racial classifications, id., at 523 , and n. 1, and that the program before the Court failed that standard.  Justice Stevens also dis *220 sented, arguing that “[rjacial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification,” id., at 537 , and that the program before the Court could not be characterized “as a ‘narrowly tailored’ remedial measure.” Id., at 541 .  Justice Marshall (joined by Justices Brennan and Blackmun) concurred in the judgment, reiterating the view of four Justices in Bakke that any race-based governmental action designed to “remed[y] the present effects of past racial discrimination” should be upheld if it was “substantially related” to the achievement of an “important governmental objective”— i.  e., such action should be subjected only to what we now call “intermediate scrutiny.” 448 U. S., at 518-519 .  In Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., <citedDecision>476 U. S. 267</citedDecision> (1986), the Court considered a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to another form of remedial racial classification.  The issue in <citedDecision>Wygant</citedDecision> was whether a school board could adopt race-based preferences in determining which teachers to lay off.  Justice Powell’s plurality opinion observed that “the level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification operates against a group that historically has not been subject to governmental discrimination,” <citedDecision>id., at 273</citedDecision> , and stated the two-part inquiry as “whether the layoff provision is supported by a compelling state purpose and whether the means chosen to accomplish that purpose are narrowly tailored.” <citedDecision>Id., at 274</citedDecision> .  In other words, “racial classifications of any sort must be subjected to ‘strict scrutiny.’” <citedDecision>Id., at 285</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The plurality then concluded that the school board’s interest in “providing minority role models for its minority students, as an attempt to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination,” <citedDecision>id., at 274</citedDecision> , was not a compelling interest that could justify the use of a racial classification.  It added that “[sjocietal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy,” <citedDecision>id., at 276</citedDecision> , and insisted instead that “a public employer ... must *221 ensure that, before it embarks on an affirmative-action program, it has convincing evidence that remedial action is warranted.  That is, it must have sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that there has been prior discrimination,” <citedDecision>id., at 277</citedDecision> .  Justice White concurred only in the judgment, although he agreed that the school board’s asserted interests could not, “singly or together, justify this racially discriminatory layoff policy.” <citedDecision>Id., at 295</citedDecision> .  Four Justices dissented, three of whom again argued for intermediate scrutiny of remedial race-based government action.  <citedDecision>Id., at 301-302</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting).  The Court’s failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove, and <citedDecision>Wygant</citedDecision> left unresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-based governmental action.  See United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S., at 166 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.) (“[Although this Court has consistently held that some elevated level of scrutiny is required when a racial or ethnic distinction is made for remedial purposes, it has yet to reach consensus on the appropriate constitutional analysis”); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 480 (1986) (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.).  Lower courts found this lack of guidance unsettling.  See, e. g., Kromnick v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 739 F. 2d 894 , 901 (CA3 1984) (“The absence of an Opinion of the Court in either Bakke or Fullilove and the concomitant failure of the Court to articulate an analytic framework supporting the judgments makes the position of the lower federal courts considering the constitutionality of affirmative action programs somewhat vulnerable”), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1107 (1985); Williams v. New Orleans, 729 F. 2d 1554, 1567 (CA5 1984) (en banc) (Hig-ginbotham, J., concurring specially); South Florida Chapter of Associated General Contractors of America, Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., 723 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA11), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 871 (1984).  The Court resolved the issue, at least in part, in 1989.  Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), concerned a *222 city’s determination that 30% of its contracting work should go to minority-owned businesses.  A majority of the Court in Croson held that “the standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification,” and that the single standard of review for racial classifications should be “strict scrutiny.” Id., at 493-494 (opinion of O’Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (“I agree ... with Justice O’Connor’s conclusion that strict scrutiny must be applied to all governmental classification by race”).  As to the classification before the Court, the plurality agreed that “a state or local subdivision .  .  .  has the authority to eradicate the effects of private discrimination within its own legislative jurisdiction,” id., at 491-492 , but the Court thought that the city had not acted with “a ‘strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary,’” id., at 500 (majority opinion) (quoting <citedDecision>Wygant, supra, at 277</citedDecision> (plurality opinion)).  The Court also thought it “obvious that [the] program is not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination.” 488 U. S., at 508 .  With Croson, the Court finally agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict scrutiny of all race-based action by state and local governments.  But Croson of course had no occasion to declare what standard of review the Fifth Amendment requires for such action taken by the Federal Government.  Croson observed simply- that the Court’s “treatment of an exercise of congressional power in Fulli-love cannot be dispositive here,” because Croson’s facts did not implicate Congress’ broad power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id., at 491 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 522 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (“[Wjithout revisiting what we held in Fullilove ... , I do not believe our decision in that case controls the one before us here”).  On the other hand, the Court subsequently indicated that Croson had at least some bearing on federal race-based ac *223 tion when it vacated a decision upholding such action and remanded for further consideration in light of Croson.  H. K. Porter Co. v. Metropolitan Dade County, 489 U. S. 1062 (1989); see also Shurberg Broadcasting of Hartford, Inc. v. FCC, 876 F. 2d 902, 915, n. 16 (CADC 1989) (opinion of Silber-man, J.) (noting the Court’s action in H. K. Porter Co.), rev’d sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990).  Thus, some uncertainty persisted with respect to the standard of review for federal racial classifications.  See, e. g., Mann v. Albany, 883 F. 2d 999, 1006 (CA11 1989) (Cro-son “may be applicable to race-based classifications imposed by Congress”); Shurberg, 876 F. 2d, at 910 (noting the difficulty of extracting general principles from the Court’s fractured opinions); id., at 959 (Wald, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (“Croson certainly did not resolve the substantial questions posed by congressional programs which mandate the use of racial preferences”); Winter Park Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 873 F. 2d 347 , 366 (CADC 1989) (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The unresolved ambiguity of Fullilove and Croson leaves it impossible to reach a firm opinion as to the evidence of discrimination needed to sustain a congressional mandate of racial preferences”), aff’d sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, supra. Despite lingering uncertainty in the details, however, the Court’s cases through Croson had established three general propositions with respect to governmental racial classifications.  First, skepticism: “Any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination,’ ” Wygant, <citedDecision>476 U. S., at 273</citedDecision> (plurality opinion of Powell, J.); Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 491 (opinion of Burger, C. J.); see also id., at 523 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (“[A]ny official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect”); McLaughlin, 379 U. S., at 192 (“[R]acial classifications [are] ‘constitutionally suspect’ ”); Hirabayashi, 320 U. S., at 100 (“Distinctions *224 between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people”).  Second, consistency: “[T]he standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification,” Croson, 488 U. S., at 494 (plurality opinion); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289-290 (opinion of Powell, J.), i.  e., all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized.  And third, congruence: “Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 93 ; see also Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 638, n. 2 ; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S., at 500 .  Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the.  Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.  Justice Powell’s defense of this conclusion bears repeating here: “If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather than the individual only because of his membership in a particular group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join the opinion of the Court, except Part III-C, and except insofar as it may be inconsistent with the following: In my view, government can never have a “compelling interest” in discriminating on the basis of race in order to “make up” for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction. See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 520 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Individuals who have been wronged by unlawful racial discrimination should be made whole; but under our Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or a debtor race. That concept is alien to the Constitution’s focus upon the individual, see Arndt. 14, § 1 (“[N]or shall any State ... deny to any person” the equal protection of the laws) (emphasis added), and its rejection of dispositions based on race, see Arndt. 15, § 1 (prohibiting abridgment of the right to vote “on account of race”), or based on blood, see Art. Ill, §3 (“[N]o Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood”); Art. I, § 9, cl. 8 (“No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States”). To pursue the concept of racial entitlement — even for the most admirable and benign of purposes — is to reinforce and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced race slavery, race privilege and race hatred. In the eyes of government, we are just one race here. It is American. It is unlikely, if not impossible, that the challenged program would survive under this understanding of strict scrutiny, but I am content to leave that to be decided on remand.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 For example, as the law currently stands, the Court will apply “intermediate scrutiny” to cases of invidious gender discrimination and “strict scrutiny” to cases of invidious race discrimination, while applying the same standard for benign classifications as for invidious ones.  If this remains the law, then today’s lecture about “consistency” will produce the anomalous result that the Government can more easily enact affirmative-action programs to remedy discrimination against women than it can enact affirmative-action programs to remedy discrimination against African-Americans — even though the primary purpose of the Equal Protection Clause was to end discrimination against the former slaves.  See Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. San Francisco, 813 F. 2d 922 (CA9 1987) (striking down racial preference under strict scrutiny while upholding gender preference under intermediate scrutiny).  When a court becomes preoccupied with abstract standards, it risks sacrificing common sense at the altar of formal consistency.  As a matter of constitutional and democratic principle, a decision by representatives of the majority to discriminate against the members of a minority race is fundamentally different from those same representatives’ decision to impose incidental costs on the majority of their constituents in order to provide a benefit to a disadvantaged minority.  5 Indeed, *248 as I have previously argued, the former is virtually always repugnant to the principles of a free and democratic society, whereas the latter is, in some circumstances, entirely consistent with the ideal of equality.  Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., <citedDecision>476 U. S. 267, 316-317</citedDecision> (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  6 *249 By insisting on a doctrinaire notion of “consistency” in the standard applicable to all race-based governmental actions, the Court obscures this essential dichotomy.  III The Court s concept of congruence assumes that there is no significant difference between a decision by the Congress of the United States to adopt an affirmative-action program and such a decision by a State or a municipality.  In my opinion that assumption is untenable.  It ignores important practical and legal differences between federal and state or local decisionmakers.  These differences have been identified repeatedly and consistently both in opinions of the Court and in separate opinions authored by Members of today’s majority.  Thus, in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990), in which we upheld a federal program designed to foster racial diversity in broadcasting, we identified the special “institu *250 tional competence” of our National Legislature.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 But two decisive distinctions separate those two cases. First, Metro Broadcasting involved a federal program, whereas Croson involved a city ordinance.  Metro Broadcasting thus drew primary support from Fullilove , which predated Croson and which Croson distinguished on the grounds of the federal-state dichotomy that the majority today discredits.  Although Members of today’s majority trumpeted the importance of that distinction in Croson, they now reject it in the name of “congruence.” It is therefore *257 quite wrong for the Court to suggest today that overruling Metro Broadcasting merely restores the status quo ante, for the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the Court reached.  Today's decision is an unjustified departure from settled law. Second, Metro Broadcasting’s holding rested on more than its application of “intermediate scrutiny.” Indeed, I have always believed that, labels notwithstanding, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program we upheld in that case would have satisfied any of our various standards in affirmative-action cases — including the one the majority fashions today.  What truly distinguishes Metro Broadcasting from our other affirmative-action precedents is the distinctive goal of the federal program in that case. Instead of merely seeking to remedy past discrimination, the FCC program was intended to achieve future benefits in the form of broadcast diversity.  Reliance on race as a legitimate means of achieving diversity was first endorsed by Justice Powell in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 311-319 (1978).  Later, in Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., <citedDecision>476 U. S. 267</citedDecision> (1986), I also argued that race is not always irrelevant to governmental decisionmaking, see <citedDecision>id., at 314-315</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., dissenting); in response, Justice O’Connor correctly noted that, although the school board had relied on an interest in providing black teachers to serve as role models for black students, that interest “should not be confused with the very different goal of promoting racial diversity among the faculty.” <citedDecision>Id., at 288</citedDecision> , n. She then added that, because the school board had not relied on an interest in diversity, it was not “necessary to discuss the magnitude of that interest or its applicability in this case.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Thus, prior to Metro Broadcasting, the interest in diversity had been mentioned in a few opinions, but it is perfectly clear that the Court had not yet decided whether that interest had sufficient magnitude to justify a racial classification.  Metro Broadcasting, of course, answered that question in the *258 affirmative.  The majority today overrules Metro Broadcasting only insofar as it is “inconsistent with [the] holding” that strict scrutiny applies to “benign” racial classifications promulgated by the Federal Government.  Ante, at 227.  The proposition that fostering diversity may provide a sufficient interest to justify such a program is not inconsistent with the Court’s holding today — indeed, the question is not remotely presented in this case — and I do not take the Court’s opinion to diminish that aspect of our decision in Metro Broadcasting.  The Court’s suggestion that it may be necessary in the future to overrule Fullilove in order to restore the fabric of the law, ante, at 235, is even more disingenuous than its treatment of Metro Broadcasting.  For the Court endorses the “strict scrutiny” standard that Justice Powell applied in Bakke , see ante, at 224, and acknowledges that he applied that standard in Fullilove as well, ante, at 218-219.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 That, in any event, is a judgment the political branches can be trusted to make.  In enacting affirmative-action programs, a legislature intends to remove obstacles that have unfairly placed individuals of equal qualifications at a competitive disadvantage.  See Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 521 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).  I do not believe such action, whether wise or unwise, deserves such an invidious label as “racial paternalism,” ante, at 240 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  If the legislature is persuaded that its program is doing more harm than good to the individuals it is designed to benefit, then we can expect the legislature to remedy the problem.  Significantly, this is not true of a government action based on invidious discrimination.  As I noted in <citedDecision>Wygant</citedDecision> : “There is ... a critical difference between a decision to exclude a member of a minority race because of his or her skin color and a decision *249 to include more members of the minority in a school faculty for that reason.  “The exclusionary decision rests on the false premise that differences in race, or in the color of a person’s skin, reflect real differences that are relevant to a person’s right to share in the blessings of a free society.  As noted, that premise is ‘utterly irrational,’ Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U. S. 432, 452 (1985), and repugnant to the principles of a free and democratic society.  Nevertheless, the fact that persons of different races do, indeed have differently colored skin, may give rise to a belief that there is some significant difference between such persons.  The inclusion of minority teachers in the educational process inevitably tends to dispel that illusion whereas their exclusion could only tend to foster it.  The inclusionary decision is consistent with the principle that all men are created equal; the exclusionary decision is at war with that principle.  One decision accords with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the other does not.

H. K. Porter Co. v. Metropolitan Dade County, 489 U. S. 1062 (1989); see also Shurberg Broadcasting of Hartford, Inc. v. FCC, 876 F. 2d 902, 915, n. 16 (CADC 1989) (opinion of Silberman, J.) (noting the Court's action in H. K. Porter Co. ), rev'd sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990).  Thus, some uncertainty persisted with respect to the standard of review for federal racial classifications.  See, e. g., Mann v.

S., at 100 ("Distinctions *224 between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people").  Second, consistency: "[T]he standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification," Croson, 488 U. S., at 494 (plurality opinion); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289-290 (opinion of Powell, J.), i.  e., all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized.  And third, congruence: "Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment," Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 93 ; see also Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 638, n. 2 ; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S., at 500 .  Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.  Justice Powell's defense of this conclusion bears repeating here: "If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather than the individual only because of his membership in a particular group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently.  Political judgments regarding the necessity for the particular classification may be weighed in the constitutional balance, [Korematsu] , but the standard of justification will remain constant.
**Combined Opinion**
 For example, as the law currently stands, the Court will apply "intermediate scrutiny" to cases of invidious gender discrimination and "strict scrutiny" to cases of invidious race discrimination, while applying the same standard for benign classifications as for invidious ones.  If this remains the law, then today's lecture about "consistency" will produce the anomalous result that the Government can more easily enact affirmative-action programs to remedy discrimination against women than it can enact affirmative-action programs to remedy discrimination against African-Americanseven though the primary purpose of the Equal Protection Clause was to end discrimination against the former slaves.  See Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. San Francisco, 813 F. 2d 922 (CA9 1987) (striking down racial preference under strict scrutiny while upholding gender preference under intermediate scrutiny).  When a court becomes preoccupied with abstract standards, it risks sacrificing common sense at the altar of formal consistency.  As a matter of constitutional and democratic principle, a decision by representatives of the majority to discriminate against the members of a minority race is fundamentally different from those same representatives' decision to impose incidental costs on the majority of their constituents in order to provide a benefit to a disadvantaged minority.  [5] Indeed, *248 as I have previously argued, the former is virtually always repugnant to the principles of a free and democratic society, whereas the latter is, in some circumstances, entirely consistent with the ideal of equality.  Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., <citedDecision>476 U. S. 267, 316-317</citedDecision> (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  [6] *249 By insisting on a doctrinaire notion of "consistency" in the standard applicable to all race-based governmental actions, the Court obscures this essential dichotomy.  III The Court's concept of "congruence" assumes that there is no significant difference between a decision by the Congress of the United States to adopt an affirmative-action program and such a decision by a State or a municipality.  In my opinion that assumption is untenable.  It ignores important practical and legal differences between federal and state or local decisionmakers.  These differences have been identified repeatedly and consistently both in opinions of the Court and in separate opinions authored by Members of today's majority.  Thus, in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990), in which we upheld a federal program designed to foster racial diversity in broadcasting, we identified the special "institutional *250 competence" of our National Legislature.
**Combined Opinion**
 Although Members of today's majority trumpeted the importance of that distinction in Croson, they now reject it in the name of "congruence." It is therefore *257 quite wrong for the Court to suggest today that overruling Metro Broadcasting merely restores the status quo ante, for the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the Court reached.  Today's decision is an unjustified departure from settled law. Second, Metro Broadcasting `s holding rested on more than its application of "intermediate scrutiny." Indeed, I have always believed that, labels notwithstanding, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program we upheld in that case would have satisfied any of our various standards in affirmative-action casesincluding the one the majority fashions today.  What truly distinguishes Metro Broadcasting from our other affirmative-action precedents is the distinctive goal of the federal program in that case. Instead of merely seeking to remedy past discrimination, the FCC program was intended to achieve future benefits in the form of broadcast diversity.  Reliance on race as a legitimate means of achieving diversity was first endorsed by Justice Powell in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 311-319 (1978).  Later, in Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., <citedDecision>476 U. S. 267</citedDecision> (1986), I also argued that race is not always irrelevant to governmental decisionmaking, see <citedDecision>id., at 314-315</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., dissenting); in response, Justice O'Connor correctly noted that, although the school board had relied on an interest in providing black teachers to serve as role models for black students, that interest "should not be confused with the very different goal of promoting racial diversity among the faculty." <citedDecision>Id., at 288</citedDecision> , n. She then added that, because the school board had not relied on an interest in diversity, it was not "necessary to discuss the magnitude of that interest or its applicability in this case." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Thus, prior to Metro Broadcasting, the interest in diversity had been mentioned in a few opinions, but it is perfectly clear that the Court had not yet decided whether that interest had sufficient magnitude to justify a racial classification.  Metro Broadcasting, of course, answered that question in the *258 affirmative.  The majority today overrules Metro Broadcasting only insofar as it is "inconsistent with [the] holding" that strict scrutiny applies to "benign" racial classifications promulgated by the Federal Government.  Ante, at 227.  The proposition that fostering diversity may provide a sufficient interest to justify such a program is not inconsistent with the Court's holding todayindeed, the question is not remotely presented in this caseand I do not take the Court's opinion to diminish that aspect of our decision in Metro Broadcasting.  The Court's suggestion that it may be necessary in the future to overrule Fullilove in order to restore the fabric of the law, ante, at 235, is even more disingenuous than its treatment of Metro Broadcasting.  For the Court endorses the "strict scrutiny" standard that Justice Powell applied in Bakke , see ante, at 224, and acknowledges that he applied that standard in Fullilove as well, ante, at 218-219.
**Combined Opinion**
 That, in any event, is a judgment the political branches can be trusted to make.  In enacting affirmative-action programs, a legislature intends to remove obstacles that have unfairly placed individuals of equal qualifications at a competitive disadvantage.  See Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 521 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).  I do not believe such action, whether wise or unwise, deserves such an invidious label as "racial paternalism," ante, at 240 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  If the legislature is persuaded that its program is doing more harm than good to the individuals it is designed to benefit, then we can expect the legislature to remedy the problem.  Significantly, this is not true of a government action based on invidious discrimination.  [5]  As I noted in <citedDecision>Wygant</citedDecision> : "There is .  .  .  a critical difference between a decision to exclude a member of a minority race because of his or her skin color and a decision to include more members of the minority in a school faculty for that reason.  "The exclusionary decision rests on the false premise that differences in race, or in the color of a person's skin, reflect real differences that are relevant to a person's right to share in the blessings of a free society.  As noted, that premise is `utterly irrational,' Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U. S. 432, 452 (1985), and repugnant to the principles of a free and democratic society.  Nevertheless, the fact that persons of different races do, indeed have differently colored skin, may give rise to a belief that there is some significant difference between such persons.  The inclusion of minority teachers in the educational process inevitably tends to dispel that illusion whereas their exclusion could only tend to foster it.  The inclusionary decision is consistent with the principle that all men are created equal; the exclusionary decision is at war with that principle.  One decision accords with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the other does not.  Thus, consideration of whether the consciousness of race is exclusionary or inclusionary plainly distinguishes the Board's valid purpose in this case from a race-conscious decision that would reinforce assumptions of inequality." <citedDecision>476 U. S., at 316-317</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  [6]  Despite the majority's reliance on Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944), ante, at 214-215, that case does not stand for the proposition that federal remedial programs are subject to strict scrutiny.  Instead, Korematsu specifies that "all legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect." 323 U. S., at 216, quoted ante, at 214 (emphasis added).  The programs at issue in this case (as in most affirmative-action cases) do not "curtail the civil rights of a single racial group"; they benefit certain racial groups and impose an indirect burden on the majority.  [7]  We have rejected this proposition outside of the affirmative-action context as well.  In Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 100 (1976), we held: "The federal sovereign, like the States, must govern impartially.

To pretend .  .  .  that the issue presented in Bakke was the same as the issue in Brown is to pretend that history never happened and that the present doesn't exist. ").
