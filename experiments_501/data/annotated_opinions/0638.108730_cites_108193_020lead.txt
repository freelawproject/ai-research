 But on November 13, 1967, he escaped from the custody of Kentucky officials and remained at large until his arrest in Alabama on February 24, 1968.  Petitioner was convicted of certain unspecified felonies in the Alabama state courts, and was sentenced to the Alabama state prison, where he was confined when he filed this action.  The validity of petitioner’s conviction on the Alabama felonies is not at issue here, just as it was not at issue before the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.  Nor does petitioner challenge the “present effect being given the [Kentucky] detainer by the [Alabama] authorities .  .  .  .” Nelson v. George, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 224, 225</citedDecision> (1970).  He attacks, rather, the validity of the *487 Kentucky indictment which underlies the detainer lodged against him by officials of that State.  In a pro se application for habeas corpus relief to the Federal District Court in the Western District of Kentucky, petitioner alleged that he had made repeated demands for a speedy trial on the Kentucky indictment, that he had been denied his right to a speedy trial, that further delay in trial would impair his ability to defend himself, and that the existence of the Kentucky indictment adversely affected his condition of confinement in Alabama by prejudicing his opportunity for parole.  In response to an order to show cause, respondent argued that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because the petitioner was not confined within the district.  Respondent added that “petitioner in the case at bar may challenge the legality of any of the adverse effects of any Kentucky detainer against him in Alabama by habeas corpus in the Alabama Federal District Court.” App. 6-7.  The District Court held, citing Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969), that Kentucky must “attempt to effect the return of a prisoner from a foreign jurisdiction for trial on pending state charges when such prisoner so demands .... Since it is the State of Kentucky which must take action, it follows that jurisdiction rests in this district which has jurisdiction over the necessary state officials.” App. 9.  Under the constraint of its earlier decision, 1 the Court of Appeals reversed but stated that it “reach [ed] this conclusion reluctantly” because of the possibility that the decision would “result in Braden’s inability to find a forum in which to assert his constitutional right to a speedy trial — a right which he is legally entitled to assert at this time under Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 *488 (1968).

 Nothing in this opinion should be taken to preclude the exercise of concurrent habeas corpus jurisdiction over the petitioner’s claim by a federal district court in the district of confinement.  But as we have made clear above, that forum will not in the ordinary ease prove as convenient as the district court in the State which has lodged the detainer.  Where a prisoner brings an action in the district of confinement attacking a detainer lodged by another State, the court can, of course, transfer the suit to a more convenient forum.  28 U. S. C. § 1404 (a).  Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U. S. 335 (1960).  Obviously, since petitioner could not have presented his habeas corpus claim prior to our 1968 decision in Peyton v. Rowe, supra, and since the choice-of-forum provisions in the habeas corpus statute were most recently amended in 1966, see n. 13, supra, we can hardly draw any inference from the fact that the amendment did not specifically overrule Ahrens with respect to the type of case now before us.  In Nelson v. George, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 224</citedDecision> , 228 n. 5 (1970), we adverted to, but reserved judgment on, the precise question at issue here.  We did point out, however, that the “obvious, logical, and practical solution is an amendment to § 2241 to remedy the shortcoming that has become apparent following the holding in Peyton v. Rowe .  Sound judicial administration calls for such an amendment.” We note that an amendment to § 2241 drafted by the Administrative Conference of the United States Courts was introduced during the 92d Congress, but no action was taken upon it.
