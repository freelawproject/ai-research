 P. 295.  Those cases, though exceptional on their facts, illustrate the reach of the taxing power of the state of the domicile as contrasted to that of the other states.  But they have no application here since most, if not all, of the barges and boats which Ohio has taxed were almost continuously outside Ohio during the taxable year.  No one vessel may have been continuously in another state during the taxable year.  But we do know that most, if not all, of them were operating in other waters and therefore under Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co., supra , could be taxed by the several states on an apportionment basis.  The rule which permits taxation by two or more states on an apportionment basis precludes taxation of all of the property by the state of the domicile.  See Union Transit *385 Co. v. Kentucky, <citedDecision>199 U. S. 194</citedDecision> .  Otherwise there would be multiple taxation of interstate operations and the tax would have no relation to the opportunities, benefits, or protection which the taxing state gives those operations.  Reversed.  MR. JUSTICE BLACK dissents.  MR. JUSTICE MINTON, dissenting.  I assume for the purposes of this dissent that none of the vessels in question were within Ohio during the tax year, and that they were taxed to their full value by Ohio.  The record shows that the vessels were all registered in Cincinnati, Ohio, as the home port, and that Ohio is the domicile of the owner.

 [*] The navigation channel might be on either side of the center line or right on the center line. Who is to say what state the vessels were in?  The doctrine of apportionment applied in Ott v. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., 336 U. S. 169 , is not in point.  In that case the domiciliary state had not sought to tax the vessels.  The tax was approved in the Ott case only on the assurance of the Louisiana Attorney General that the taxing statute "was intended to cover and actually covers here, an average portion of property permanently within the StateÂ—and by permanently is meant throughout the taxing year." Ibid., at 175.  Without such assurance there would have been no basis for applying the apportionment rule.  New York Central R. Co. v. Miller, 202 U. S. 584 ; Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141 U. S. 18, 26 ; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, <citedDecision>199 U. S. 194, 206</citedDecision> .  The record in this case is silent as to whether any proportion of the vessels were in any one state for the whole *387 of a taxable year.  The record does show that no other state collected taxes on the vessels for the year in question or any other year.  Until this case, it has not been the law that the state of the owner's domicile is prohibited from taxing under such circumstances.  Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, supra , is a case in point.  There the owner of the vessels was a Kentucky corporation which operated between various coastal ports.  None of the vessels were ever near Kentucky, but Kentucky was allowed to tax them because it was the state of the owner's domicile.
