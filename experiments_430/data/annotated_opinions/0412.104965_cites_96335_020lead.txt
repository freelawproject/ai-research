**Lead Opinion**
 Those cases, though exceptional on their facts, illustrate the reach of the taxing power of the state of the domicile as contrasted to that of the other states.  But they have no application here since most; if not all, of the barges and boats which Ohio has taxed were almost continuously outside Ohio during the taxable year.  No one vessel may have been continuously in another state during the taxable year.  But we do know that most, if not all, of them were operating in other waters and therefore under Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co., supra, could be taxed by the.several states on an apportionment basis.  The rule which permits taxatioft by two or more states on.  an apportionment basis precludes taxation of all of the property by the state of the domicile.  See Union Transit *385 Co. v. Kentucky, <citedDecision>199 U. S. 194</citedDecision> .  Otherwise there would be multiple taxation of interstate operations and the tax would have no relation to the opportunities, benefits, or protection which the taxing state gives those operations.  Reversed.  Mr. Justice Black dissents.
