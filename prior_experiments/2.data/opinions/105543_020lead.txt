<p id="AhT">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b456-13">Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr., petitioner, and Patricia Vanderbilt, respondent, were married in 1948. They separated in 1952 while living in California. The wife moved to New York where she has resided since February 1953. In March of that year the husband filed suit for <page-number citation-index="1" label="417">*417</page-number>divorce in Nevada. This proceeding culminated, in June 1953, with a decree of final divorce which provided that both husband and wife were “freed and released from the bonds of matrimony and all the duties and obligations thereof . ...” <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The wife was not served with process in Nevada and did not appear before the divorce court.</p>
<p id="b457-5">In April 1954, Mrs. Vanderbilt instituted an action in a New York court praying for separation from petitioner and for alimony. The New York court did not have personal jurisdiction over him, but in order to satisfy his obligations, if any, to Mrs. Vanderbilt, it sequestered his property within the State.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He appeared specially and, among other defenses to the action, contended that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> compelled the New York court to treat the Nevada divorce as having ended the marriage and as having destroyed any duty of support which he owed the respondent. While the New York court found the Nevada decree valid and held that it had effectively dissolved the marriage, it nevertheless entered an order, under § 1170-b <page-number citation-index="1" label="418">*418</page-number>of the New York Civil Practice Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> directing petitioner to make designated support payments to respondent. 207 Misc. 294, 138 N. Y. S. 2d 222. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the support order. 1 N. Y. 2d 342, 135 N. E. 2d 553. Petitioner then applied to this Court for certiorari contending that § 1170-b, as applied, is unconstitutional because it contravenes the Full Faith and Credit Clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We granted certiorari, 352 U. S. 820.</p>
<p id="b458-6">In <em>Estin </em>v. <em>Estin, </em>334 U. S. 541, this Court decided that a Nevada divorce court, which had no personal jurisdiction over the wife, had no power to terminate a husband’s obligation to provide her support as required in a preexisting New York separation decree. The factor which distinguishes the present case from <em>Estin </em>is that here the wife’s right to support had not been reduced to judgment prior to the husband’s <em>ex parte </em>divorce. In our opinion this difference is not material on the question before us. Since the wife was not subject to its jurisdiction, the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which she had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband. It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, the Nevada divorce court <page-number citation-index="1" label="419">*419</page-number>was as powerless to cut off the wife’s support right as it would have been to order the husband to pay alimony if the wife had brought the divorce action and he had not been subject to the divorce court’s jurisdiction. Therefore, the Nevada decree, to the extent it purported to affect the wife’s right to support, was void and the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not obligate New York to give it recognition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b459-5">Petitioner claims that this case is governed by <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>226 U. S. 551. For the reasons given in a concurring opinion in <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>350 U. S. 568, 575, at 580-581, the <em>Thompson </em>case, insofar as it held that an <em>ex parte </em>divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.</p>
