 See ante, at 310.  Thus, the Court concludes, Bellas Hess “did not automatically fall with Free *323 man and its progeny” in our decision in Complete Auto. See ante, at 311.  I am unpersuaded by this attempt to distinguish Bellas Hess from Freeman and Spector, both of which were repudiated by this Court. See Complete Auto, supra, at 288-289 , and n. 15.  What we disavowed in Complete Auto was not just the “formal distinction between ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ taxes on interstate commerce,” ante, at 310, but also the whole notion underlying the Bellas Hess physical-presence rule — that “interstate commerce is immune from state taxation,” Complete Auto, supra, at 288 .  The Court compounds its misreading by attempting to show that Bellas Hess “is not inconsistent with Complete Auto and our recent cases.” Ante, at 311.  This will be news to commentators, who have rightly criticized Bellas Hess.  1 Indeed, the majority displays no small amount of audacity in claiming that our decision in National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 551, 559</citedDecision> (1977), which was rendered several weeks after Complete Auto, reaffirmed the continuing vitality of Bellas Hess.  See ante, at 311.  Our decision in that case did just the opposite.  National Geographic held that the National Geographic Society was liable for use tax collection responsibilities in California.  The Society conducted an out-of-state mail-order business similar to the one at issue here and in Bellas Hess, and in addition, maintained two small offices in California that solicited advertisements for National Geographic Magazine.  The Society argued that its physical presence in California was unrelated to its mail-order sales, and thus that the Bel- *324 las Hess rule compelled us to hold that the tax collection responsibilities could not be imposed.  We expressly rejected that view, holding that the “requisite nexus for requiring an out-of-state seller [the Society] to collect and pay the use tax is not whether the duty to collect the use tax relates to the seller’s activities carried on within the State, but simply whether the facts demonstrate ‘some definite link, some minimum connection, between (the State and) the person... it seeks to tax.’” 430 U. S., at 561 (citation omitted).

 I would think that protectionist rules favoring a $180-billion-a-year industry might come within the scope of such “structural concerns.” See Brief for State of New Jersey as Amicus Curiae 4.  IV The Court attempts to justify what it rightly acknowledges is an “artificial” rule in several ways.  See ante, at 315.  First, it asserts that the Bellas Hess principle “firmly establishes the boundaries of legitimate state authority to impose a duty to collect sales and use taxes and reduces litigation concerning those taxes.” Ante, at 315.  It is very doubtful, *330 however, that the Court’s opinion can achieve its aims.  Certainly our cases now demonstrate two “bright-line” rules for mail-order sellers to follow: Under the physical-presence requirement reaffirmed here, they will not be subjected to use tax collection if they have no physical presence in the taxing State; under the National Geographic rule, mail-order sellers will be subject to use tax collection if they have some presence in the taxing State even if that activity has no relation to the transaction being taxed.  See National Geographic, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 560-562</citedDecision> .  Between these narrow lines lies the issue of what constitutes the requisite “physical presence” to justify imposition of use tax collection responsibilities.  Instead of confronting this question head on, the majority offers only a cursory analysis of whether Quill’s physical presence in North Dakota was sufficient to justify its use tax collection burdens, despite briefing on this point by the State.  3 See Brief for Respondent 45-47.  North Dakota contends that even should the Court reaffirm the Bellas Hess rule, Quill’s physical presence in North Dakota was sufficient to justify application of its use tax collection law. Quill concedes it owns software sent to its North Dakota customers, but suggests that such property is insufficient to justify a finding of nexus.  In my view, the question of Quill’s actual physical presence is sufficiently close to cast doubt on the majority’s confidence that it is propounding a truly “bright-line” rule.  Reasonable minds surely can, and will, differ over what showing is required to make out a “physical pres *331 ence” adequate to justify imposing responsibilities for use tax collection.

 Since we specifically limited the question on which certiorari was granted in order not to consider the potential retroactive effects of overruling Bellas Hess, I believe we should leave that issue for another day. If indeed fears about retroactivity are driving the Court’s decision in this case, we would be better served, in my view, to address *333 those concerns directly rather than permit them to infect our formulation of the applicable substantive rule.  Although Congress can and should address itself to this area of law, we should not adhere to a decision, however right it was at the time, that by reason of later cases and economic reality can no longer be rationally justified.  The Commerce Clause aspect of Bellas Hess, along with its due process holding, should be overruled.  See, e. g., P. Hartman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxation § 10.8 (1981); Hartman, Collection of Use Tax on Out-of-State Mail-Order Sales, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 993 , 1006-1015 (1986); Hellerstein, Significant Sales and Use Tax Developments During the Past Half Century, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 961 , 984-985 (1986); McCray, Overturning Bellas Hess: Due Process Considerations, 1985 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 265, 288-290; Rothfeld, Mail Order Sales and State Jurisdiction to Tax, 53 Tax Notes 1405 , 1414-1418 (1991).  Similarly, I am unconvinced by the majority’s reliance on subsequent decisions that have cited Bellas Hess.  See ante, at 311.  In D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988), for example, we distinguished Bellas Hess on the basis of the company’s “significant economic presence in Louisiana, its many connections with the State, and the direct benefits it receives from Louisiana in conducting its business.” We then went on to note that the situation presented was much more analogous to that in National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1977).  See 486 U. S., at 33-34 .  In Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981), the Court cited Bellas Hess not to revalidate the physical-presence requirement, but rather to establish that a “nexus” must exist to justify imposition of a state tax. And finally, in *325 Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 437 (1980), the Court cited Bellas Hess for the due process requirements necessary to sustain a tax. In my view, these citations hardly signal the continuing support of Bellas Hess that the majority seems to find persuasive.  Instead of remanding for consideration of whether Quill’s ownership of software constitutes sufficient physical presence under its new Commerce Clause nexus requirement, the majority concludes as a matter of law that it does not.  See ante, at 315, n. 8.  In so doing, the majority rebuffs North Dakota’s challenge without setting out any clear standard for what meets the Commerce Clause physical-presence nexus standard and without affording the State an opportunity on remand to attempt to develop facts or otherwise to argue that Quill’s presence is constitutionally sufficient.  For the federal rule, see Flora v. United States, 357 U. S. 63 (1958); see generally J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation § 58A.05 (1992).
