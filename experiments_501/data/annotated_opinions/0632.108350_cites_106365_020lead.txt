Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court. This case raises an important issue concerning the construction of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution— whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1163 (B) (1956), which is part of Arizona's Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, is invalid under that clause as being in conflict with the mandate of § 17 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. § 35 , providing that receipt of a discharge in bankruptcy fully discharges all but certain specified judgments.  The courts below, concluding that this case was controlled by Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, <citedDecision>369 U. S. 153</citedDecision> (1962), and Reitz v. Mealey, 314 U. S. 33 (1941), two earlier opinions of this Court dealing with alleged conflicts between the Bankruptcy Act and state financial responsibility laws, ruled against the claim of conflict and upheld the Arizona statute.  On July 8, 1965, petitioner Adolfo Perez, driving a car registered in his name, was involved in an automobile accident in Tucson, Arizona.  The Perez automobile was not covered by liability insurance at the time of the collision.  The driver of the second ca,r was the minor daughter of Leonard Pinkerton, and in September 1966 the Pinkertons sued Mr. and Mrs. Perez in state court for personal injuries and property damage sustained in the accident.  On October 31, 1967, the petitioners confessed judgment in this suit, and a judgment order was entered against them on November 8, 1967, for $2,425.98 plus court costs.  Mr. and Mrs. Perez each filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in Federal District Court on November 6, 1967.  Each of them duly scheduled the judgment debt *639 to the Pinkertons.

 until the person gives proof of financial responsibility” for a future period.  8 Again, the validity of this limited requirement that some drivers post evidence of financial responsibility for the future in order to regain driving privileges is not questioned here.  Nor is the broader issue of whether a *643 State may require proof of financial responsibility as a precondition for granting driving privileges to anyone before us for decision.  What is at issue here is the power of a State to include as part of this comprehensive enactment designed to secure compensation for automobile accident victims a section providing that a discharge in bankruptcy of the automobile accident tort judgment shall have no effect on the judgment debtor’s obligation to repay the judgment creditor, at least insofar as such repayment may be enforced by the withholding of driving privileges by the State.  It was that question, among others, which petitioners raised after suspension of their licenses and registration by filing a complaint in Federal District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and requesting a three-judge court. They asserted several constitutional violations, and also alleged that § 28-1163 (B) was in direct conflict with the Bankruptcy Act and was thus violative of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.  9 In support of their complaint, Mr. and Mrs. Perez filed affidavits stating that the suspension of their licenses and registration worked both physical and financial hardship upon them and their children.  The District Judge granted the petitioners leave to proceed in forma pauperis, but thereafter granted the respondents’ motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, citing <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz.  10 The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on *644 the same two decisions.  421 F. 2d 619 (CA9 1970).  We granted certiorari.  400 U. S. 818 (1970).  I Deciding whether a state statute is in conflict with a federal statute and hence invalid under the Supremacy-Clause is essentially a two-step process of first ascertaining the construction of the two statutes and then determining the constitutional question whether they are in conflict.  In the present case, both statutes have been authoritatively construed.

 .  [i]nthe final analysis,” our function is to determine whether a challenged state statute “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941).  Since Hines the Court has frequently adhered to this articulation of the meaning of the Supremacy Clause.  See, e. g., Nash v. Florida Industrial Comm’n, 389 U. S. 235, 240 (1967); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225, 229 (1964); Colorado Anti-Discrimination Comm’n v. Continental Air Lines, Inc., 372 U. S. 714, 722 (1963) (dictum); Free v. Bland, 369 U. S. 663, 666 (1962); Hill v. Florida, 325 U. S. 538 , 542-543 (1945); Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., 317 U. S. 173, 176 (1942).  Indeed, in Florida Lime & *650 Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132 (1963), a recent case in which the Court was closely divided, all nine Justices accepted the Hines test.  Id., at 141 (opinion of the Court), 165 (dissenting opinion).  Both <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> 13 and Reitz , however, ignored this controlling principle.  The Court in <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> conceded that Utah’s financial responsibility law left “the bankrupt to some extent burdened by the discharged debt,” 369 U. S., at 171, made “it more probable that the debt will be paid despite the discharge,” id., at 173, and thereby made “some inroad ... on the consequences of bankruptcy .  .  .  .” Id., at 171.  Utah’s statute, in short, frustrated Congress’ policy of giving discharged debtors a new start.  But the <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> majority was not concerned by this frustration.  In upholding the statute, the majority opinion did not look to the effect of the legislation but simply asserted that the statute was “not an Act for the Relief of Mulcted Creditors,” <citedDecision>id., at 174</citedDecision> , and was “not designed to aid collection of debts but to enforce a policy against irresponsible driving .  .  .  .” <citedDecision>Id., at 169</citedDecision> .  The majority, that is, looked to the purpose of the state legislation and upheld it because the purpose was not to circumvent the Bankruptcy Act but to promote highway safety; those in dissent, however, were concerned that, whatever the purpose of the Utah Act, its “plain and inevitable effect .  .  .  [was] to create a powerful weapon for collection of a debt from which [the] bankrupt [had] been released by federal law.” <citedDecision>Id., at 183</citedDecision> .  Such a result, they argued, left “the States free ... to impair ... an important and historic policy *651 of this Nation .  .  .  embodied in its bankruptcy laws.” <citedDecision>Id., at 185</citedDecision> .  The opinion of the Court in Reitz was similarly concerned, not with the fact that New York’s financial responsibility law frustrated the operation of the Bankruptcy Act, but with the purpose of the law, which was divined as the promotion of highway safety.  As the Court said: “The penalty which § 94-b imposes for injury due to careless driving is not for the protection of the creditor merely, but to enforce a public policy that irresponsible drivers shall not, with impunity, be allowed to injure their fellows.  The scheme of the legislation would be frustrated if the reckless driver were permitted to escape its provisions by the simple expedient of voluntary bankruptcy, and, accordingly, the legislature declared that a discharge in bankruptcy should not interfere with the operation of the statute.  Such legislation is not in derogation of the Bankruptcy Act.  Rather it is an enforcement of permissible state policy touching highway safety.” 314 U. S., at 37 .  The dissenting opinion written by Mr. Justice Douglas for himself and three others noted that the New York legislation put “the bankrupt ... at the creditor’s mercy,” with the results that “[i]n practical effect the bankrupt may be in as bad, or even worse, a position than if the state had made it possible for a creditor to attach his future wages” and that “[bankruptcy .  .  .  [was not] the sanctuary for hapless debtors which Congress intended.” Id., at 41 .  We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than *652 one of frustration.  Apart from the fact that it is at odds with the approach taken in nearly all our Supremacy Clause cases, such a doctrine would enable state legislatures to nullify nearly all unwanted federal legislation by simply publishing a legislative committee report articulating some state interest or policy — other than frustration of the federal objective — that would be tapgentially furthered by the proposed state law. In view of the consequences, we certainly would not apply the <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> doctrine in all Supremacy Clause cases. Although it is possible to argue that <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz are somehow confined to cases involving either bankruptcy or highway safety, analysis discloses no reason why the States should have broader power to nullify federal law in these fields than in others.  Thus, we conclude that <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz can have no authoritative effect to the extent they are inconsistent with the controlling principle that any state legislation which frustrates the full effectiveness of federal law is rendered invalid by the Supremacy Clause.  Section 28-1163 (B) thus may not stand.  III Even accepting the Supremacy Clause analysis of <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz — that is, looking to the purpose rather than the effect of state laws — those decisions are not dispositive of this case. Just as <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> went a step beyond Reitz and broadened the holding of the earlier case, 369 U. S., at 184 (dissenting opinion), so in the present case the respondents asked the courts below and this Court to expand the holdings of the two previous cases. The distinction between <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz and this case lies in the State’s expressed legislative purpose.  <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz were aberrational in their treatment of this question as well.  The majority opinions in both cases assumed, without citation of state court authority or any indication that such precedent was unavailable, *653 that the purpose of the state financial responsibility laws there under attack was not provision of relief to creditors but rather deterrence of irresponsible driving.  The assumption was, in effect, that all state legislatures which had enacted prdvisions such as § 28-1163 (B) had concluded that an uninsured motorist about to embark in his car would be more careful on the road if he did not have available what the majority in <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> cavalierly characterized as an “easy refuge in bankruptcy.” 369 U. S., at 173.  14 Passing the question of whether the Court gave sufficient attention to binding state interpretations of state legislative purpose and conceding that it employed proper technique in divining as obvious from their face the aim of the state enactments, the present case raises doubts about whether the Court was correct even in its basic assumptions.  The Arizona Supreme Court has declared that Arizona’s Safety Responsibility Act “has for its principal purpose the protec *654 tion of the public .  .  .  from financial hardship” resulting from involvement in traffic accidents with uninsured motorists unable to respond to a judgment.  Schecter v. Killingsworth, 93 Ariz., at 280 , 380 P. 2d, at 140 .  The Court in <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> was able to declare, although the source of support is unclear, that the Utah statute could be upheld because it was “not an Act for the Relief of Mulcted Creditors” or a statute “designed to- aid collection of debts.” 369 U. S., at 174, 169.  But here the respondents urge us to- uphold precisely the sort of statute that <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> would have stricken down — one with a declared purpose to protect judgment creditors “from financial hardship” by giving them a powerful weapon with which to force bankrupts to pay their debts despite their discharge.  Whereas the Acts in <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz had the effect of frustrating federal law but had, the Court said, no such purpose, the Arizona Act has both that effect and that purpose.  Believing as we do that <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz are not in harmony with sound constitutional principle, they certainly should not be extended to cover this new and distinguishable case. IV One final argument merits discussion.  The dissent points out that the District of Columbia Code contains an anti-discharge provision similar to that included in the Arizona Act.  Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act of the District of Columbia, D. C. Code Ann. § 40-464 (1967), 68 Stat. 132 .  In light of our decision today, the sum of the argument is to draw into question the constitutional validity of the District's anti-discharge section, for as noted in the dissent the Constitution confers upon Congress the power “[t]o establish .  .  .  uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.” U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 4 (emphasis *655 added).

 U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  Mr. and Mrs. Perez also alleged in their complaint that certain provisions of the Arizona Act imposed involuntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment, and denied Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection.  They also claimed that portions of the Arizona Act operated as a bill of attainder in violation of Art. I, § 10, of the Constitution.  The District Judge, in refusing to request the convening of a three-judge court, ruled that these constitutional claims were “obviously insubstantial.” The Court of Appeals agreed.  421 F. 2d 619 , 625 (CA9 1970).  Because *644 of our resolution of this case, we express no opinion as to the substantiality of any of petitioners’ other constitutional claims.  As discussed below, the majorities in <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz also seemed unwilling to be bound by, or even to look for, state court constructions of the financial responsibility laws before them.  See *645 infra, at 652-654.  It is clear, however, from even a cursory examination of decisions in other States that the conclusion of the Arizona Supreme Court as to the purpose of the financial responsibility law is by no means unusual.  See, e. g., Sullivan v. Cheatham, 264 Ala. 71, 76 , 84 So. 2d 374, 378 (1955) (“The purpose of the [Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility] Act is clearly to require and establish financial responsibility for every owner or operator of a motor vehicle ‘in any manner involved in an accident.’.  .  .  The Act is designed to protect all persons having claims arising out of highway accidents.”); Escobedo v. State Dept. of Motor Vehicles, 35 Cal. 2d 870, 876 , 222 P. 2d 1, 5 (1950) (“[T]he state chose to allow financially irresponsible licensed operators to drive until they became involved in an accident with the consequences described in the [financial responsibility law] and their financial irresponsibility was thus brought to the attention of the department, and then to require suspension of their licenses.”); People v. Nothaus, 147 Colo. 210, 215-216 , 363 P. 2d 180, 183 (1961) (“The requirement of C. R. S. ’53, 13-7-7, that the director of revenue, '.

 See Reitz, 314 U. S., at 40-43 (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Under Art. 3 of the Arizona Act, dealing with the posting of security for damages arising from a particular accident, the victim may cut the superintendent out by executing a release from liability or agreeing to some other written settlement or confession of judgment providing for payment of some damages, in installments or otherwise.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1143 (A) (4) discussed in n. 2, supra. Assuming that such an agreement or confession of judgment providing for installment payments is filed with the superintendent, it prevents him from suspending driving privileges for failure to post the amount of financial security the superintendent determines to be necessary; however, if the careless driver later defaults on one installment, the victim may give notice to the superintendent, who must then use his power of suspension to either coerce full payment or the posting of security.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1144 (3), discussed in n. 3, supra. Under Art. 4, dealing with suspension for nonpayment of a judgment, the victim who has chosen to reduce his claim to judgment maintains substantial control over the suspension of driving privileges if the judgment remains unsatisfied 60 days after entry.  He may consent that the judgment debtor’s driving privileges not be suspended, but the debtor still must furnish proof of financial responsibility for the future.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §28-1162 (B).  For an argument that a similar provision delegating to judgment creditors the right to choose which careless drivers who do not pay judgments shall escape suspension conflicts with the Bankruptcy Act see Kesler, <citedDecision>369 U. S., at 179-182</citedDecision> (Warren, C. J., dissenting) .  If the judgment debtor is able to secure a discretionary court order permitting him to pay a judgment in installments under §28-1165 (A), the creditor may cause suspension of driving privileges until the judgment is fully satisfied by notifying the superintendent of any default in payment of the installments.  Ariz. Rev. *648 Stat. Ann. §28-1165 (C).  Again, however, the judgment debtor must still give proof of financial responsibility for the future.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1165 (B).  <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> also decided a jurisdictional question, holding that a Supremacy Clause challenge to a state statute was required to be heard by a three-judge district court under 28 U. S. C. §2281 .  See 369 U. S., at 155-158.  This jurisdictional part of the decision was overruled almost four years later in Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965).  It also seems clear that even under the logic of <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz Mrs. Perez should not have lost her driving privileges.  She was not present when the accident occurred, and no act or omission on her part contributed to it.  Because the automobile was community property under Arizona law and because judgment was confessed as to her in the Pinkerton negligence action, the Court of Appeals reasoned that loss of Mrs. Perez’ license “is the price an Arizona wife must pay for negligent driving by her husband of the community vehicle” when the resulting judgment is not paid.  421 F. 2d, at 624.  The <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz assumption that depriving uninsured motorists of the full relief afforded by a discharge in bankruptcy would prompt careful driving is without foundation when applied to Mrs. Perez.  As the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated in a recent decision involving similar facts: “Even accepting the fiction that, as applied to drivers, motor vehicle responsibility statutes are intended to promote safety, it is just too much fiction to contend that, applied to a judgment debtor held vicariously liable for the omission of a sub-agent, the statute is anything but a means for the enforcement of judgments.” Miller v. Anckaitis, 436 F. 2d 115, 118 (CA3 1970) (en banc).  See S. Rep. No. 10, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935); H. R. Rep. No. 208, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935) (both presenting a summary of the provisions of the proposed statute dealing with “Financial Responsibility of Motor Vehicle Operators in the District of Columbia,” but failing to mention the fact that a discharge in bankruptcy of an accident judgment would have no effect on suspension of driving privileges for failure to satisfy such judgment); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 799, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935) (Conference Report making no mention of anti-discharge provision); 79 Cong. Rec. 272-273 (Senate); 79 Cong. Rec. 3416-3417, 4621-4629, 4631-4641, 6556-6564 (House).  Some members of the House, which debated some aspects of the financial responsibility law concept rather extensively in 1935, demonstrated in debate that they were totally unaware of any of the provisions designed to enforce payment of a judgment for injuries caused by the first accident of a financially irresponsible driver.  See 79 Cong. Rec. 4624 (remarks of Reps. Fitzpatrick and Sisson); id,., at 4625 (remarks of Rep. Hull).  When the present District of Columbia financial responsibility law was enacted in 1954, debate was much more limited and the reports of the House and Senate District Committees were quite brief.  Except for the reading of the bill, no mention was made of the anti-discharge provision.
