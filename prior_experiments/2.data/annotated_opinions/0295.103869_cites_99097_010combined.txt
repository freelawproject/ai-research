Such power exists to prevent impairment of the manner in, or means by which Congress effectuates its Indian policy, at least so long as Congress has not determined that the interests of the Indians require their complete release from tutelage or the final termination of the United States' guardian hip over them.

Both devices had a common purpose, to protect a dependent people against loss of their property through their own improvidence or the greed of others during the period of transition in which they began to assume the responsibilities of citizenship. To achieve this purpose the protection afforded by Congress was not niggardly. See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U.S. 286 , 31 S.Ct. 578 , 55 L.Ed. 738 ; Heckman v. United States, 224 U.S. 413 , 32 S.Ct. 424 , 56 L.Ed. 820 ; Brader v. James, <targetCase>246 U.S. 88</targetCase> , <targetCase>38 S.Ct. 285</targetCase> , 62 L.Ed. 591 . 36 State taxation of 'restricted' lands as well as taxation of 'trust' lands, in the absence of Congressional authorization, is a possible cause of the loss which Congress has said shall not occur. The restrictions are not limited to voluntary sale consistently with their purpose they extend to all forms of transfer or encumbrance, involuntary as well as voluntary. Cf. Goudy v. Meath, 203 U.S. 146 , 27 S.Ct. 48 , 51 L.Ed.
