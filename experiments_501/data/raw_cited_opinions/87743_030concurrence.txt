<p id="b692-9">In addition to what has been said by my brother Field, in all of which I concur, I desire to state, that .on the 8th of January, 1866, the Supreme Court of Iowa, by a decision which was unanimous, held the bonds .which are the foundation of this suit to be void, on the ground that the charter conferred no authority on the city to lend its credit, and that the transaction in this case was'a loan of credit, and not a borrowing of money.</p>
