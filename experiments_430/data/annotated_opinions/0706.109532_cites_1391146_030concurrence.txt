 The court also has the obligation of determining whether the penalty was “imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.” §27-2537 (c)(1) (Supp. 1975).  The Georgia Supreme Court has interpreted the appellate review statute to require it to set aside the death sentence whenever juries across the State impose it only rarely for the type of crime in question; but to require it to affirm death sentences whenever juries across the State generally impose it for the crime in question.  *224 Thus, in this case the Georgia Supreme Court concluded that the death penalty was so rarely imposed for the crime of robbery that it set aside the sentences on the robbery counts, and effectively foreclosed that penalty from being imposed for that crime in the future under the legislative scheme now in existence.  Similarly, the Georgia Supreme Court has determined that juries impose the death sentence too rarely with respect to certain classes of rape.  Compare Coley v. State, 231 Ga. 829 , 204 S. E. 2d 612 (1974), with Coker v. State, 234 Ga. 555 , 216 S. E. 2d 782 (1975).  However, it concluded that juries “generally throughout the state” have imposed the death penalty for those who murder witnesses to armed robberies.  Jarrell v. State, <citedDecision>234 Ga. 410, 425</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>216 S. E. 2d 258, 270</citedDecision> .  (1975).  Consequently, it affirmed the sentences in this case on the murder counts.  If the Georgia Supreme Court is correct with respect to this factual judgment, imposition of the death penalty in this and similar cases is consistent with Furman .  Indeed, if the Georgia Supreme Court properly performs the task assigned to it under the Georgia statutes, death sentences imposed for discriminatory reasons or wantonly or freakishly for any given category of crime will be set aside.  Petitioner has wholly failed to establish, and has not even attempted to establish, that the Georgia Supreme Court failed properly to perform its task in this case or that it is incapable of performing its task adequately in all cases; and this Court should not assume that it did not do so. Petitioner also argues that decisions made by the prosecutor — either in negotiating a plea to some lesser offense than capital murder or in simply declining to charge capital murder — are standardless and will inexorably result in the wanton and freakish imposition of the penalty condemned by the judgment in Furman .  I address this *225 point separately because the cases in which no capital offense is charged escape the view of the Georgia Supreme Court and are not considered by it in determining whether a particular sentence is excessive or disproportionate.

 All kidnapping cases were likewise reviewed.  The comparison involved a search for similarities in addition to the similarity of offense charged and sentence imposed.  “All of the murder cases selected for comparison involved mur *220 ders wherein all of the witnesses were killed or an attempt was made to kill all of the witnesses, and kidnapping eases where the victim was killed or seriously injured.  “The cases indicate that, except in some special circumstance such as a juvenile or an accomplice driver of a get-away vehicle, where the murder was committed and trial held at a time when the death penalty statute was effective, juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty.  The death penalty has also been imposed when the kidnap victim has been mistreated or seriously injured.  In this case the victim was murdered.  “The cold blooded and callous nature of the offenses in this case are the types condemned by death in other cases. This defendant's death sentences for murder and kidnapping are not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Using the standards prescribed for our review by the statute, we conclude that the sentences of death imposed in this case for murder and kidnapping were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.” Jarrell v. State, <citedDecision>234 Ga. 410, 425-426</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>216 S. E. 2d 258, 270</citedDecision> (1975).  See Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 240 (Douglas, J., concurring).  See id., at 306 (Stewart, J., concurring).  See id., at 310 (White, J., concurring).  Petitioner also argues that the differences between murder — for which the death penalty may be imposed — and manslaughter — -for which it may not be imposed- — -are so difficult to define and the jury’s ability to disobey the trial judge’s instructions so unfettered that juries will use the guilt-determination phase of a trial arbitrarily to convict some,of a capital offense while convicting similarly situated individuals only of noncapital offenses.  I believe this argument is enormously overstated.  However, since the jury has discretion not to impose the death penalty at the sentencing phase of a case in Georgia, the problem of offense definition and jury nullification loses virtually all its significance in this case. The factor relevant to this case is that the “murder .
