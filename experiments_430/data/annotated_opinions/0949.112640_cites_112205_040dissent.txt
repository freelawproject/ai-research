**Dissenting Opinion**
 Indeed, the duty arose out of a distinct distrust of state courts, which this Court perceived as attempting to evade federal review.  See Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina ex rel. Daniel, 281 U. S. 537, 540 (1930) (“Even though the constitutional protection invoked be denied on non-federal grounds, it is the province of this Court to inquire whether the decision of the state court rests upon a fair and substantial basis.  If unsubstantial, constitutional obligations may not thus be evaded”).  From these noble beginnings, the Court has managed to transform the duty to protect federal rights into a self-fashioned abdication.  Defying the constitutional allocation *762 of sovereign authority, the Court now requires a federal court to scrutinize the state-court judgment with an eye to denying a litigant review of his federal claims rather than enforcing those provisions of the Federal Bill of Rights that secure individual autonomy.  II Even if one acquiesced in the majority s unjustifiable elevation of abstract federalism over fundamental precepts of liberty and fairness, the Court’s conclusion that the plain-statement rule of Michigan v. Long does not apply to a summary order defies both settled understandings and compassionate reason.  A As an initial matter, it cannot seriously be disputed that the Court’s opinion in Harris v. Reed, <citedDecision>489 U. S. 255</citedDecision> (1989), expressly considered this issue and resolved the question quite contrary to the Court’s holding today.  Both Long and <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> involved a federal review of a state-court opinion that, on its face, addressed the merits of the underlying claims and resolved those claims with express reference to both state and federal law. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1037 , and n. 3; Harris, <citedDecision>489 U. S., at 257-258</citedDecision> .  In each case, it was not disputed that the alleged state ground had been invoked: The Court was faced with the question whether that state ground was adequate to support the judgment and independent of federal law. Accordingly, the Long and <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> Courts spoke of state-court judgments that “fairly appea[r] to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law,” Long, 463 U. S., at 1040 , or that contained “ambiguous .  .  .  references to state law.” Harris, <citedDecision>489 U. S., at 263</citedDecision> .  The majority asserts that these statements establish a factual predicate for the application of the plain-statement rule.  Ante, at 735-736.  Neither opinion, however, purported to limit the application of the plain-statement rule to the narrow *763 circumstances presented in the case under review.  In fact, the several opinions in <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> make plain that for purposes of federal habeas, the Court was adopting the Long presumption for all cases where federal claims are presented to state courts.  The <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> Court expressed its understanding of Long unequivocally: “We held in Long that unless the state court clearly expressed its reliance on an adequate and independent state-law ground, this Court may address a federal issue considered by the state court.” <citedDecision>489 U. S., at 262-263</citedDecision> .  Armed with that understanding, the Court concluded that “a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case ‘“clearly and expressly” ’ states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar.” <citedDecision>Id., at 263</citedDecision> , quoting Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 327 (1985), in turn quoting Long, 463 U. S., at 1041 .  Justice O’Connor, in a concurring opinion joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, echoed the majority’s indication that the Long presumption applied to all cases where a federal claim is presented to the state courts.  She wrote separately to emphasize that the Court’s opinion did not alter the well-settled rule that federal courts may look to state procedural-default rules in determining whether a federal claim has been properly exhausted in the state courts.  See <citedDecision>489 U. S., at 268-270</citedDecision> .  “[I]t is simply impossible,” according to the concurrence, “to ‘[r]equir[e] a state court to be explicit in its reliance on a procedural default’ .  .  .  where a claim raised on federal habeas has never been presented to the state courts at all.” <citedDecision>Id., at 270</citedDecision> .  Certainly, if the Court’s opinion had been limited to cases where the state court’s judgment fairly appeared to rest on federal law or was interwoven with federal law, the point painstakingly made in this concurrence would have been unnecessary.  That Harris’ adoption of the plain-statement rule for federal habeas cases was intended to apply to all cases where *764 federal claims were presented to the state courts is confirmed by the exchange there between the majority and the dissent.  In his dissenting opinion, Justice Kennedy maintained that the Court’s formulation of the plain-statement rule would encourage habeas prisoners whose claims would otherwise be procedurally barred to file “a never-ending stream of petitions for postconviction relief” in hope of being “rewarded with a suitably ambiguous rebuff, perhaps a one-line order finding that a prisoner’s claim ‘lacks merit’ or stating that relief is ‘denied.’” Id., at 282 (emphasis added).  The Court responded that “the dissent’s fear .  .  .  that our holding will submerge courts in a flood of improper prisoner petitions is unrealistic: a state court that wishes to rely on a procedural bar rule in a one-line pro forma order easily can write that ‘relief is denied for reasons of procedural default.  ’ ” <citedDecision>Id., at 265, n. 12</citedDecision> .  The <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> Court’s holding that the plain-statement rule applies to a summary order could not itself have been more plain.  Because the majority acknowledges that the Virginia Supreme Court’s dismissal order “adds some ambiguity,” ante, at 744, <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> compels a federal ha-beas court to provide a forum for the consideration of Coleman’s federal claims.  B Notwithstanding the clarity of the Court’s holding in <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> , the majority asserts that Coleman has read the rule- announced therein “out of context.” Ante, at 736.  I submit, however, that it is the majority that has wrested <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> out of the context of a preference for the vindication of fundamental constitutional rights and that has set it down in a vacuum of rhetoric about federalism.  In its attempt to justify a blind abdication of responsibility by the federal courts, the majority’s opinion marks the nadir of the Court’s recent ha-beas jurisprudence, where the discourse of rights is routinely replaced with the functional dialect of interests.  The Court’s habeas jurisprudence now routinely, and without evident reflection, subordinates fundamental constitutional rights to *765 mere utilitarian interests.  See, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991).  Such unreflective cost-benefit analysis is inconsistent with the very idea of rights.  See generally Cover & Aleinikoff, Dialectical Federalism: Habeas Corpus and the Court, 86 Yale L. J. 1035, 1092 (1977).  The Bill of Rights is not, after all, a collection of technical interests, and “surely it is an abuse to deal too casually and too lightly with rights guaranteed” therein.
