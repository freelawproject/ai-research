 .  .  .” Petitioners, *476 New York State Tax Commissioners, rejected respondent’s claim for a refund of the tax based on the ground that his salary was constitutionally exempt from state taxation because the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation is an instrumentality of the United States Government and that he, during the.  taxable year, was an employee of the federal government engaged in the performance of a governmental function.  On review by certiorari the Board’s action was set aside by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, 253 App. Div. 91 ; 1 N. Y. S. 2d 195, whose order was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  278 N. Y. 691 ; 16 N. E. 2d 404 .  Both courts held respondent’s salary was free from tax on the authority of New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, <citedDecision>299 U. S. 401</citedDecision> , which sustained the claim that New York could not constitutionally tax the salary of an employee of the Panama Rail Road Company, a wholly-owned corporate instrumentality of the United States.  We granted certiorari, 305 U. S. 592 , the constitutional question presented by the record being of public importance.  The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation was created pursuant to § 4 (a) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 128 , 12 U. S. C. § 1461 et seg., which was enacted to provide emergency relief to home owners, particularly to assist them with respect to home mortgage indebtedness.  The corporation, which is authorized to lend money to home owners on mortgages and to refinance home mortgage loans within the purview of the Act, is declared by § 4 (a) to be an instrumentality of the United States.  Its shares of stock are wholly government-owned.  § 4 (b).  Its funds are deposited in the Treasury of the United States, and the compensation of its employees is paid by drafts upon the Treasury.  *477 For the purposes of this case we may assume that the creation of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation was,a constitutional exercise of the powers of the federal government.  Cf. Kay v. United States, 303 U. S. 1 .  As that government derives its authority wholly from powers delegated to it by the Constitution, its every action within its constitiitional power is governmental action, and since Congress is made the sole judge of what powers within the constitutional grant are to be, exercised, all' activities of government constitutionally authorized by Congress must stand on a parity with respect to their constitutional immunity from taxation.  McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 432 ; Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U. S. 151, 158-159 ; South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437 , 451—452; Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405 , 412—415.  And when the national government lawfully acts through a corporation which it owns and controls, those activities are governmental functions entitled to whatever tax immunity attaches to those functions when carried on by the government itself through its departments.  See McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 421- 422; Smith v. Kansas City Title Co., 255 U. S. 180, 208 ; Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, 261 U. S. 374 ; <citedDecision>New York ex rel. Rogers</citedDecision> v. Graves, supra. The single question with which we are now concerned is whether the tax laid by the state upon the salary of respondent, employed by a corporate instrumentality of the federal government, imposes an unconstitutional burden upon that government.  The theory of the tax immunity of either government, state or national, and its instrumentalities, from taxation by the other, has been rested Upon an implied liniitation on the taxing power of each, such as to forestall undue interference, through the exercise of that power, with the govern *478 mental activities of the other.  That the two types of immunity may not, in all respects, stand on a parity has been recognized from the beginning, McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 435-436 , and possible differences in application, deriving from differences in the source, nature and extent of the immunity of the governments and their agencies, were pointed out and discussed by this Court in detail during the last term. Helvering v. Gerhardt, supra, 412-413, 416 .  So far as now relevant, those differences have been thought to be traceable to the fact that the federal government, is one of delegated powers in the exercise of which Congress is supreme; so that every agency which Congress can constitutionally create is a governmental agency.  And since the power to create the -agency includes the implied power to do whatever is needful or appropriate, if not expressly prohibited, to protect the agency, there has been attributed to Congress some scope, the limits of which it is not now necessary to define, for granting or withholding immunity of federal agencies from state taxation.  See Van Allen v. The Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 583, 585 ; Bank v. Supervisors, 7 Wall. 26, 30, 31 ; Thomson v. Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall. 579, 588, 590 ; People v. Weaver, 100 U. S. 539, 543 ; Mercantile Bank v. New York, 121 U. S. 138, 154 ; Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, 173 U. S. 664, 668 ; Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U. S. 575, 581 ; Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, Inc., 296 U. S. 521, 525-526 ; Baltimore National Bank v. State Tax Comm’n, 297 U. S. 209, 211-212 ; British-American Oil Co. v. Board, 299 U. S. 159 ; James v. Bravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134, 161 ; Helvering v. Gerhardt, supra, 411, 412, 417 ; cf. United States v. Bekins, 304 U. S. 27, 52 .  Whether its power to grant tax exemptions as an incident to the exercise of powers specifically granted by the Constitution can ever, in any circumstances, extend beyond the con *479 stitutional immunity of federal- agencies which courts have implied, is a question which need not now be determined.
**Lead Opinion**
 The burden on government of a non-discriminatory income tax applied to the salary of the employee of a government or its instrumentality is the same, whether a state or national government is concerned.  The determination in the Gerhardt case that the federal income tax imposed on the employees of the Port Authority was not a burden on the Port Authority made it unnecessary to consider whether the Authority itself was immune from federal taxation; the claimed immunity failed because even if the Port Authority were *486 • itself immune from federal income tax, the tax upon the income of its employees cast upon it no unconstitutional burden.  Assuming, as we do, that the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation is clothed with the same immunity from state taxation as the government itself, we cannot say that the present tax on the income of its employees lays any unconstitutional burden upon it.  All the reasons for refusing to imply a constitutibnal prohibition of .federal income taxation of salaries of state employees, stated at length in the Gerhardt case, are of'equal force when immunity is-claimed from state income tax on salaries paid by the national government or its agencies.  In this respect we perceive no basis for a difference in result whether the taxed income 'be salary or some other form of compensation, or whether the taxpayer be an employee or an officer of either a .state or the national government, or of its instrumentalities.  In no case is there basis for the assumption that any such tangible or certain economic burden is imposed on the government concerned, as would justify a court’s declaring that the taxpayer is clothed with the implied constitutional tax immunity of the government by which he is employed.  That assumption, made in Collector v. Day, supra, and in <citedDecision>New York ex rel. Rogers</citedDecision> v. Graves, supra, is contrary to the reasoning and to the conclusions reached in the Gerhardt case and in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra; Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, 283 U. S. 279 ; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., supra; McLoughlin v. Commissioner, 303 U. S. 218 .  In their light the assumption can no longer be made.  Collector v. Day, supra, and <citedDecision>New York ex rel. Rogers</citedDecision> v. Graves, supra, are overruled so far as they recognize an implied constitutional immunity from income taxation of the salaries of officers or employees of the national or a state government or their instrumentalities.  *487 So much of tke burden of a non-discriminatory general tax upon the incomes of employees of a government, state or national, as may be passed on economically to that government, through the effect of the tax on the price level of labor or materials, is but the normal incident of the organization within the same, territory of two governments, each possessing the taxing power.  The burden, so far as it can be said to exist or to affect the- government in any indirect or incidental way, is one which the Constitution presupposes, and hence it cannot rightly be deemed to be within an implied restriction upon the taxing power of the national and state governments which the Constitution has expressly granted to one and has confirmed to the other.  The immunity is not one to be implied from the Constitution, because if allowed it would impose to an inadmissible extent a restriction on the taxing power which the Constitution has reserved to the state governments.  Reversed.  Me. Chief Justice Hughes concurs in the result.  .  The failure of Congress to regulate interstate commerce has generally been taken to signify a Congressional purpose to leave undisturbed the authority of the states to make regulations affecting the commerce in matters of peculiarly local concern, but to withhold from them authority to make regulations affecting those phases, of it which, because of the-need of a national uniformity, demand that their regulation, if any, be prescribed by a single authority.  Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 319 ; Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352 , 399-400; Kelly v. Washington, 302 U. S. 1, 14 ; South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Brothers, 303 U. S. 177 , 184-185; Milk Control Board v. Eisenberg Farm Products, ante, p. 346.  As to the implications from Congressional silence in the field of state taxation of interstate commerce and its instrumentalities, see Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 ; Gwin, White & Prince v. Henneford, 305 U. S. 434 .  In Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435 , a Pennsylvania tax, nominally laid upon the office of the captain of a federal revenue cutter, but roughly measured by the salary paid to the officer, was held invalid.  The Court seems to have rested its decision in párt on the ground that a tax on the emoluments of his office was the equivalent of a tax upon an activity of the national government, and in part on the ground that it was, an infringement of the implied superior power of Congress to fix the compensation of government employees without diminution by state taxation.  In Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 , this Court held that the salary of a state probate judge was constitutionally immune from federal income tax on the grounds that the salary of an officer of a state is exempt from, federal taxation if the function he performs as an officer is exempt, citing Dobbins v. Commissioners, supra, and that there was an implied constitutional restriction upon the power of the national government to tax a state in the exercise of those functions which were essential to the maintenance of state governments as they were organized át the time when the Constitution was adopted.  The possibility that a non-discriminatory tax upon the income of a state officer did not involve any substantial interference *482 with the functioning of the state government was not discussed either in this or the Dobbins case. In New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, <citedDecision>299 U. S. 401</citedDecision> , the question was whether the salary of the general counsel of the Panama Rail Road Company was exempt from state income tax because the railroad company was an instrumentality of the federal government.  The sole question raised by the taxing state was whether the railroad company was a government instrumentality.  The Court, having found that the railroad company was such an instrumentality, disposed of the matter of tax exemption of the salary of its employees by declaring: “The railroad company being immune from state taxation, it necessarily results that fixed salaries and compensation paid to its officers and employees in their capacity as such are likewise immune.” <citedDecision>New York ex rel. Rogers</citedDecision> v. Graves, supra, 408.  In Brush v. Commissioner, 300 U. S. 352 , the applicable treasury regulation upon which the government relied exempted from federal income tax the compensation of “state officers and employees” for “services rendered in connection with the exercise of an essential governmental function of the State.” The Court held that the maintenance of the public water system of New York City was an essential governmental function, and in determining whether the salary of the engineer in charge of that project was subject to federal income tax the Court declared, citing <citedDecision>New York ex rel. Rogers</citedDecision> v. Graves, supra, 408; “The answer depends upon whether the water system of the city was created and is conducted in the exercise of the city's governmental functions.  .  If so, its operations are immune from federal taxation and, as a necessary corollary, ‘fixed salaries and compensation paid to its officers and employees in their capacity as such are likewise immune.” Brush v. Commissioner, supra, 360.  The fact that the expenses ef the one government might be lessened if all those who deal with it were exempt from taxation by the other was thought not to be an adequate basis for tax immunity in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514 ; Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, 283 U. S. 279 ; Burnet v. Jergins Trust, 288 U. S. 508 ; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134 ; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376 .  That the economic burden of a tax on salaries is passed on to the employer or that employees will accept a lower government salary because of its tax immunity, are formulas which- have not won acceptance by 'economists and cannot be judicially assumed.  As to the “passing on” of the economic burden of the tax, see Seligman, Income Tax, VII Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, 626-638; Plehn, Public Finance (5th ed.), p. 320; Buehler, Public Finance, p. 240; Lutz, Public Finance (2d ed.), p. 336, and see Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, 283 U. S. 570 , 581, footnote 1.  As to preference for government employment because the salary is tax exempt, see Dickinson, Compensating Industrial Effort (1937), pp. 7-8; Douglas, The Reality of Non-Commercial Incentives in Industrial Life, c. V of The Trend of Economics (1924); Vol. I, Fetter, Economic Principles (1915), p. 203.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 Where' are we to stop in enumerating -the functions of the State governments which will be interfered with by Federal taxation?  .  .  .  How can we now tell what the effect of this decision will be?' I cannot but regard it as founded on a fallacy, and that it will lead to mischievous consequences.” ( 11 Wall. 113, 128-29 .)

Especially is this true of the Australian Constitution.  One of its framers, who afterwards became one of the most distinguished of Australian judges, Mr. Justice Higgins, characterized it as having followed our Constitution with “pe.dantic imitation.” Australasian Temperance & G. M. Life Assurance Society v. Howe, 31 C. L. R. 290, 330.  Abbott v. City of St. John, 40 Can. Sup. Ct. 597; Caron v. The King, (1924) A. C. 999; Amalgamated Society of Engineers v. Adelaide Steamship Co., 28 C. L. R. 129; West v. Commissioner of Taxation, 56 C. L. R. 657.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Butler, dissenting: Mr. Justice McReynolds and I- are of opinion that the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, being an instrumentality of the United States heretofore deemed immune from state taxation, “it necessarily results,” as held in New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves (1937) <citedDecision>299 U. S. 401</citedDecision> , “that fixed salaries and compensation paid to its officers and employees in their capacity as such are likewise immune”; and that the judgment of the state court, unquestionably required by that decision, should be affirmed: From the decision just announced, it is clear that the Court has overruled Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County (1842) 16 Pet. 435 ; Collector v. Day (1871) 11 Wall. 113 ; <citedDecision>New York ex rel. Rogers</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Graves, supra,</citedDecision> and Brush v. Commissioner (1937) 300 U. S. 352 .  Thus now it appears that the United States has always had power to tax salaries of state officers and employees and that *493 similarly free have been the States to tax salaries of officers and employees of the United States.  The compensation for past as well as for future service to be taxed and the rates prescribed in the exertion of the newly disclosed power depend on legislative discretion not subject to judicial revision.  Futile indeed are the vague intimations that this Court may protect against excessive or destructive taxation.  Where the power to tax exists, legislatures may exert it to destroy, to discourage, to protect or exclusively for the purpose of raising revenue.  See e. g. Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 548 ; McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27 , 53 et seq.; Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40 , 44 et seq.; Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U. S. 308 .  Appraisal of lurking or apparent implications of the Court’s opinion can serve no useful end for, should occasion arise, they may be ignored or given direction differing from that at first seemingly intended.
