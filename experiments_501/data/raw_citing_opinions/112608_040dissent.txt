<p id="AU9">with whom Justice Marshall joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="b639-8">At the end of its opinion, the Court pays lipservice to the proposition that should provide the basis for a correct analysis of the legal question presented by this case: It is ‘“a cardinal principle that “searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment — subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.’” <em>Mincey </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109905"><a href="/opinion/109905/mincey-v-arizona/#390" aria-description="Citation for case: Mincey v.

<p id="b639-9">Relying on arguments that conservative judges have repeatedly rejected in past cases, the Court today — despite its disclaimer to the contrary, <em>ibid.— </em>enlarges the scope of the automobile exception to this “cardinal principle,” which un-dergirded our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence prior to the retirement of the author of the landmark opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="AWV">The Fourth Amendment is a restraint on Executive power. The Amendment constitutes the Framers’ direct constitutional response to the unreasonable law enforcement practices employed by agents of the British Crown. See <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="98094"><a href="/opinion/98094/weeks-v-united-states/#389" aria-description="Citation for case: Weeks v.

Over the years—particularly in the period immediately after World War II and particularly in opinions authored by Justice Jackson after his service as a special prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials — the Court has recognized the importance of this restraint as a bulwark against police practices that prevail in totalitarian regimes. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Di Re, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104490"><a href="/opinion/104490/united-states-v-di-re/#595" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="ADG">This history is, however, only part of the explanation for the warrant requirement. The requirement also reflects the sound policy judgment that, absent exceptional circumstances, the decision to invade the privacy of an individual’s personal effects should be made by a neutral magistrate rather than an agent of the Executive. In his opinion for the Court in <em><span class="citation" data-id="104504"><a href="/opinion/104504/johnson-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Johnson v. United States">Johnson</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, id., </em>at 13-14, Justice Jackson explained:</p>
<blockquote id="AsN">“The point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.”</blockquote>
<p id="Arii">Our decisions have always acknowledged that the warrant requirement imposes a burden on law enforcement. And our <page-number citation-index="1" label="587">*587</page-number>cases have not questioned that trained professionals normally make rehable assessments of the existence of probable cause to conduct a search. We have repeatedly held, however, that these factors are outweighed by the individual interest in privacy that is protected by advance judicial approval. The Fourth Amendment dictates that the privacy interest is paramount, no matter how marginal the risk of error might be if the legality of warrantless searches were judged only after the fact.</p>
<p id="b641-5">In the concluding paragraph of his opinion in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span>, </em>Chief Justice Burger made the point this way:</p>
<blockquote id="b641-6">“Even though on this record the issuance of a warrant by a judicial officer was reasonably predictable, a line must be drawn. In our view, when no exigency is shown to support the need for an immediate search, the Warrant Clause places the line at the point where the property to be searched comes under the exclusive dominion of police authority. Respondents were therefore entitled to the protection of the Warrant Clause with the evaluation of a neutral magistrate, before their privacy interests in the contents of [their luggage] were invaded.” <span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/#15" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">433 U. S., at 15-16</a></span>.</blockquote>
<p id="b641-7">In <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span>, </em>the Department of Justice had mounted a frontal attack on the warrant requirement. The Government’s principal contention was that “the Fourth Amendment Warrant Clause protects only interests traditionally identified with the home.” <span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/#6" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick"><em>Id., </em>at 6</a></span>. We categorically rejected that contention, relying on the history and text of the Amendment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the policy underlying the warrant require<page-number citation-index="1" label="588">*588</page-number>ment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a line of cases spanning over a century of our jurisprudence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also rejected the Government’s alternative argument that the rationale of our automobile search cases demonstrated the reasonableness of permitting war-rantless searches of luggage.</p>
<p id="b642-5">We concluded that neither of the justifications for the automobile exception could support a similar exception for luggage. We first held that the privacy interest in luggage is “substantially greater than in an automobile.” <span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/#13" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick"><em>Id., </em>at 13</a></span>. Unlike automobiles and their contents, we reasoned, “[l]ug-gage contents are not open to public view, except as a condition to a border entry or common carrier travel; nor is luggage subject to regular inspections and official scrutiny on a continuing basis.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Ibid.</a></span> </em>Indeed, luggage is specifically intended to safeguard the privacy of personal effects, unlike an automobile, “whose primary function is transportation.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Ibid.</a></span></em></p>
<p id="b642-6">We then held that the mobility of luggage did not justify creating an additional exception to the Warrant Clause. Unlike an automobile, luggage can easily be seized and detained pending judicial approval of a search. Once the police have <page-number citation-index="1" label="589">*589</page-number>luggage “under their exclusive control, there [i]s not the slightest danger that the [luggage] or its contents could [be] removed before a valid search warrant could be obtained. . . . With the [luggage] safely immobilized, it [i]s unreasonable to undertake the additional and greater intrusion of a search without a warrant” (footnote omitted). <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Ibid.</a></span></em></p>
<p id="b643-5">Two Terms after <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span>, </em>we decided a case in which the relevant facts were identical to those before the Court today. In <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110119"><a href="/opinion/110119/arkansas-v-sanders/" aria-description="Citation for case: Arkansas v. Sanders">442 U. S. 753</a></span> (1979), the police had probable cause to search a green suitcase that had been placed in the trunk of a taxicab at the Little Rock Airport. Several blocks from the airport, they stopped the cab, arrested the passengers, seized the suitcase and, without obtaining a warrant, opened and searched it.</p>
<p id="b643-6">The Arkansas Supreme Court held that the search was unconstitutional. Relying on <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span>, </em>the state court had no difficulty in concluding that there was “nothing in this set of circumstances that would lend credence to an assertion of impracticability in obtaining a search warrant.” <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>State, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1666834"><a href="/opinion/1666834/sanders-v-state/#600" aria-description="Citation for case: Sanders v.

Over the dissent of Justice Blackmun and then-JusTiCE Rehnquist, both of whom had also dissented in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span>, </em>this Court affirmed. In his opinion for the Court, Justice Powell noted that the seizure of the green suitcase was entirely proper,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but that the State nevertheless had the burden of justifying the warrantless search,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that it had “failed to <page-number citation-index="1" label="590">*590</page-number>carry its burden of demonstrating the need for warrantless searches of luggage properly taken from automobiles.” <span class="citation" data-id="110119"><a href="/opinion/110119/arkansas-v-sanders/#763" aria-description="Citation for case: Arkansas v. Sanders">442 U. S., at 763</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b644-5">Chief Justice Burger wrote separately to identify the distinction between cases in which police have probable cause to believe contraband is located somewhere in a vehicle — the typical automobile exception case — and eases like <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span> </em>and <em>Sanders </em>in which they had probable cause to search a particular container before it was placed in the car. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote id="b644-6">“Because the police officers had probable cause to believe that respondent’s green suitcase contained marihuana before it was placed in the trunk of the taxicab, their duty to obtain a search warrant before opening it is clear under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">433 U. S. 1</a></span> (1977). The essence of our holding in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span> </em>is that there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of a trunk or suitcase accompanying or being carried by a person; that expectation of privacy is not diminished simply because the owner’s arrest occurs in a public place. Whether arrested in a hotel lobby, an airport, a railroad terminal, or on a public street, as here, the owner has the right to expect that the contents of his luggage will not, without his consent, be exposed on demand of the police. . . .</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b644-7">“The breadth of the Court’s opinion and its repeated references to the ‘automobile’ from which respondent’s suitcase was seized at the time of his arrest, however, might lead the reader to believe — as the dissenters apparently do — that this case involves the ‘automobile’ exception to the warrant requirement. See <em>ante, </em>at 762-765, and n. 14. It does not. Here, as in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span>, </em>it was the <em>luggage </em>being transported by respondent at <page-number citation-index="1" label="591">*591</page-number>the time of the arrest, not the automobile in which it was being carried, that was the suspected locus of the contraband.” <span class="citation" data-id="110119"><a href="/opinion/110119/arkansas-v-sanders/#766" aria-description="Citation for case: Arkansas v. Sanders">442 U. S., at 766-767</a></span> (opinion concurring in judgment).</blockquote>
<p id="b645-5">Chief Justice Burger thus carefully explained that <em>Sanders, </em>which the Court overrules today, “simply d[id] not present the question of whether a warrant is required before opening luggage when the police have probable cause to believe contraband is located <em>someiohere </em>in the vehicle, but when they do <em>not </em>know whether, for example, it is inside a piece of luggage in the trunk, in the glove compartment, or concealed in some part of the car’s structure.” <em>Id., </em>at 767. We confronted that question in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ross, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ross">456 U. S. 798</a></span> (1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b645-6">We held in <em><span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ross">Ross</a></span> </em>that “the scope of the warrantless search authorized by [the automobile] exception is no broader and no narrower than a magistrate could legitimately authorize by warrant.” See <span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/#825" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ross"><em>id., </em>at 825</a></span>. The inherent mobility of the vehicle justified the immediate search without a warrant, but did not affect the scope of the search. See <span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/#822" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ross"><em>id., </em>at 822</a></span>. Thus, the search could encompass containers, which might or might not conceal the object of the search, as well as the remainder of the vehicle. See <span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/#821" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ross"><em>id., </em>at 821</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b645-7">Our conclusion was supported not only by prior cases defining the proper scope of searches authorized by warrant, as well as cases involving the automobile exception, but also by practical considerations that apply to searches in which the police have only generalized probable cause to believe that contraband is somewhere in a vehicle. We explained that, in such instances, “prohibiting police from opening immediately a container in which the object of the search is most likely to be found and instead forcing them first to comb the entire vehicle would actually exacerbate the intrusion on privacy in<page-number citation-index="1" label="592">*592</page-number>terests.” <span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/#821" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ross"><em>Id., </em>at 821, n. 28</a></span>. Indeed, because “the police could never be certain that the contraband was not secreted in a yet undiscovered portion of the vehicle,” the most likely result would be that “the vehicle would need to be secured while a warrant was obtained.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ross">Ibid.</a></span></em></p>
<p id="b646-5">These concerns that justified our holding in <em><span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ross">Ross</a></span> </em>are not implicated in cases like <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span> </em>and <em>Sanders </em>in which the police have probable cause to search a <em>particular </em>container rather than the <em>entire </em>vehicle. Because the police can seize the container which is the object of their search, they have no need either to search or to seize the entire vehicle. Indeed, as even the Court today recognizes, they have no authority to do so.

<p id="b646-6">In reaching our conclusion in <em><span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b646-7">Thus, we recognized in <em><span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b647-5">II</p>
<p id="b647-6">In its opinion today, the Court recognizes that the police did not have probable cause to search respondent’s vehicle and that a search of anything but the paper bag that respondent had carried from Daza’s apartment and placed in the trunk of his car would have been unconstitutional. <em>Ante, </em>at 580. Moreover, as I read the opinion, the Court assumes that the police could not have made a warrantless inspection of the bag before it was placed in the car. See <em>ibid. </em>Finally, the Court also does not question the fact that, under our prior cases, it would have been lawful for the police to seize the container and detain it (and respondent) until they obtained a search warrant. <em>Ante, </em>at 575. Thus, all of the relevant facts that governed our decisions in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b647-7">The Court does not attempt to identify any exigent circumstances that would justify its refusal to apply the general rule against warrantless searches. Instead, it advances these three arguments: First, the rules identified in the foregoing cases are confusing and anomalous. <em>Ante, </em>at 576-579. Second, the rules do not protect any significant interest in privacy. <em>Ante, </em>at 573-576.

<p id="b650-6">The decided cases thus provide no support for the Court’s concern about “confusion.” The Court instead relies primarily on predictions that were made by Justice Blackmun in his dissenting opinions in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

The only support offered by the Court, other than the unsubstantiated allegations of prior dissents, is three law review comments and a sentence from Professor LaFave’s treatise. None of the law review pieces <page-number citation-index="1" label="597">*597</page-number>criticize the holdings in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span> </em>and <em>Sanders.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The sentence from Professor LaFave’s treatise, at most, indicates that, as is often the case, there may be some factual situations at the margin of the relevant rules that are difficult to decide. Moreover, to the extent Professor LaFave criticizes our jurisprudence in this area, he is critical of <em><span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span> </em>or <em>Sanders. </em>And he ultimately concludes that even <em><span class="citation" data-id="110719"><a href="/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ross">Ross</a></span> </em>was correctly decided. See 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 55-56 (2d ed. 1987).</p>
<p id="b651-5">The Court summarizes the alleged “anomaly” created by the coexistence of <em>Ross, Chadwick, </em>and <em>Sanders </em>with the statement that “the more likely the police are to discover drugs in a container, the less authority they have to search it.” <em>Ante, </em>at 577. This juxtaposition is only anomalous, however, if one accepts the flawed premise that the degree to which the police are likely to discover contraband is correlated with their authority to search <em>without a warrant. </em>Yet, even proof beyond a reasonable doubt will not justify a war-rantless search that is not supported by one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. And, even when the police have a warrant or an exception applies, once the police possess probable cause, the extent to which they are more or less certain of the contents of a container has no bearing on their authority to search it.</p>
<p id="b652-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="598">*598</page-number>To the extent there was any “anomaly” in our prior jurisprudence, the Court has “cured” it at the expense of creating a more serious paradox. • For surely it is anomalous to prohibit a search of a briefcase while the owner is carrying it exposed on a public street yet to permit a search once the owner has placed the briefcase in the locked trunk of his car. One’s privacy interest in one’s luggage can certainly not be diminished by one’s removing it from a public thoroughfare and placing it — out of sight — in a privately owned vehicle. Nor is the danger that evidence will escape increased if the luggage is in a car rather than on the street. In either location, if the police have probable cause, they are authorized to seize the luggage and to detain it until they obtain judicial approval for a search. Any line demarking an exception to the warrant requirement will appear blurred at the edges, but the Court has certainly erred if it believes that, by erasing one line and drawing another, it has drawn a clearer boundary.</p>
<p id="b652-5">
<em>The Privacy Argument</em>
</p>
<p id="b652-6">The Court’s statement that <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span> </em>and <em>Sanders </em>provide only “minimal protection to privacy,” <em>ante, </em>at 576, is also unpersuasive. Every citizen clearly has an interest in the privacy of the contents of his or her luggage, briefcase, handbag or any other container that conceals private papers and effects from public scrutiny. That privacy interest has been recognized repeatedly in cases spanning more than a century. See, <em>e. g., Chadwick, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/#6" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">433 U. S., at 6-11</a></span>; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Leeuwen, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108099"><a href="/opinion/108099/united-states-v-van-leeuwen/#251" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Van Leeuwen">397 U. S. 249, 251</a></span> (1970); <em>Ex parte Jackson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="89759"><a href="/opinion/89759/ex-parte-jackson/#733" aria-description="Citation for case: Ex Parte Jackson">96 U. S. 727, 733</a></span> (1878).</p>
<p id="b652-7">Under the Court’s holding today, the privacy interest that protects the contents of a suitcase or a briefcase from a war-rantless search when it is in public view simply vanishes when its owner climbs into a taxicab. Unquestionably the rejection of the <em>Sanders </em>line of cases by today’s decision will result in a significant loss of individual privacy.</p>
<p id="b653-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="599">*599</page-number>To support its. argument that today’s holding works only a minimal intrusion on privacy, the Court suggests that “[i]f the police know that they may open a bag only if they are actually searching the entire car, they may search more extensively than they otherwise would in order to establish the general probable cause required by <em>Ross.” Ante, </em>at 574-575. As I have already noted, see n. 9, <em>supra, </em>this fear is unexplained and inexplicable. Neither evidence uncovered in the course of a search nor the scope of the search conducted can be used to provide <em>post hoc </em>justification for a search unsupported by probable cause at its inception.</p>
<p id="b653-5">The Court also justifies its claim that its holding inflicts only minor damage by suggesting that, under <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110559"><a href="/opinion/110559/new-york-v-belton/" aria-description="Citation for case: New York v. Belton">453 U. S. 454</a></span> (1981), the police could have arrested respondent and searched his bag if respondent had placed the bag in the passenger compartment of the automobile instead of in the trunk. In <em><span class="citation" data-id="110559"><a href="/opinion/110559/new-york-v-belton/" aria-description="Citation for case: New York v. Belton">Belton</a></span>, </em>however, the justification for stopping the car and arresting the driver had nothing to do with the subsequent search, which was based on the potential danger to the arresting officer. The holding in <em><span class="citation" data-id="110559"><a href="/opinion/110559/new-york-v-belton/" aria-description="Citation for case: New York v. Belton">Belton</a></span> </em>was supportable under a straightforward application of the automobile exception. See <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110558"><a href="/opinion/110558/robbins-v-california/#449" aria-description="Citation for case: Robbins v. California">453 U. S. 420, 449-453</a></span> (1981) (Stevens, J., dissenting). I would not extend <em>Belton’s, </em>holding to this case, in which the container—which was protected from a warrantless search before it was placed in the car—provided the only justification for the arrest. Even accepting <em>Belton’s </em>application to a case like this one, however, the Court’s logic extends its holding to a container placed in the <em>trunk </em>of a vehicle, rather than in the passenger compartment. And the Court makes this extension without any justification whatsoever other than convenience to law enforcement.</p>
<p id="b653-6">
<em>The Burden on Law Enforcement</em>
</p>
<p id="b653-7">The Court’s suggestion that <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span> </em>and <em>Sanders </em>have created a significant burden on effective law enforcement <page-number citation-index="1" label="600">*600</page-number>is unsupported, inaccurate, and, in any event, an insufficient reason for creating a new exception to the warrant requirement.</p>
<p id="b654-5">Despite repeated claims that <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span> </em>and <em>Sanders </em>have “impeded effective law enforcement,” <em>ante, </em>at 574, 576, the Court cites no authority for its contentions. Moreover, all evidence that does exist points to the contrary conclusion. In the years since <em>Ross was </em>decided, the Court has heard argument in 30 Fourth Amendment cases involving narcotics.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In all but one, the government was the petitioner.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> All save two involved a search or seizure without a warrant or with a defective warrant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And, in all except three, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the search or seizure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b655-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="601">*601</page-number>In the meantime, the flow of narcotics cases through the courts has steadily and dramatically increased.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See Annual Report of the Attorney General of the United States 21 (1989). No impartial observer could criticize this Court for hindering the progress of the war on drugs. On the contrary, decisions like the one the Court makes today will support the conclusion that this Court has become a loyal foot soldier in the Executive’s fight against crime.</p>
<p id="b655-5">Even if the warrant requirement does inconvenience the police to some extent, that fact does not distinguish this constitutional requirement from any other procedural protection secured by the Bill of Rights. It is merely a part of the price that our society must pay in order to preserve its freedom. Thus, in a unanimous opinion that relied on both <em><span class="citation" data-id="104504"><a href="/opinion/104504/johnson-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Johnson v.

Chadwick">Chadwick</a></span>, </em>Justice Stewart wrote:</p>
<blockquote id="b655-6">“Moreover, the mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment. Cf. <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>[<span class="citation" data-id="108377"><a href="/opinion/108377/coolidge-v-new-hampshire/#481" aria-description="Citation for case: Coolidge v. New Hampshire">403 U. S. 443, 481</a></span> (1971)]. The investigation of crime would always be simplified if warrants were unnecessary. But the Fourth Amendment reflects the view of those who wrote the Bill of Rights that the privacy of a person’s home and property may not be totally sacrificed in the name of maximum simplicity in enforcement of the criminal law.

<p id="b647-8"> Although the Court today purports to acknowledge that the warrant requirement is the general rule, <em>ante, </em>at 580, it nonetheless inexplicably persists in referring to <em><span class="citation" data-id="109714"><a href="/opinion/109714/united-states-v-chadwick/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b649-8"> In its discussion of the <em><span class="citation" data-id="111305"><a href="/opinion/111305/united-states-v-johns/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Johns">Johns</a></span> </em>case, the Court makes the puzzling statement that it “cannot see the benefit of a rule that requires law enforcement officers to conduct a more intrusive search in order to justify a less intrusive one.” See <em>ante, </em>at 575. I assume that the Court does not mean to suggest that evidence found during the course of a search may provide the probable cause that justifies the search. Our cases have unequivocally rejected this bootstrap justification for a search which was not lawful when it commenced. See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Di Re, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104490"><a href="/opinion/104490/united-states-v-di-re/#595" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

Perhaps the Court fears that defendants will attempt similar <em>post hoc </em>reasoning and argue that, when the police have searched only a container rather than the whole car, they must have had probable cause only to search the container. If so, the Court’s fear is unwarranted, for <em><span class="citation" data-id="111305"><a href="/opinion/111305/united-states-v-johns/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.
