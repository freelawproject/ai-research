 The state court had no other relevant evidence before it when it determined that Tamayo-Reyes actually understood the charge to which he was pleading.  Contrary to the impression conveyed by this Court’s opinion, the question whether a federal court should defer to this sort of dubious “factfinding” in addressing a habeas corpus *14 petition is one with a long history behind it, a history that did not begin with Townsend v. Sain .  II A The availability and scope of habeas corpus have changed over the writ’s long history, but one thing has remained constant: Habeas corpus is not an appellate proceeding, but rather an original civil action in a federal court. See, e. g., Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257, 269 (1978).  It was settled over a hundred years ago that “[t]he prosecution against [a criminal defendant] is a criminal prosecution, but the writ of habeas corpus ... is not a proceeding in that prosecution.  On the contrary, it is a new suit brought by him to enforce a civil right.” Ex parte Tom Tong, 108 U. S. 556, 559-560 (1883).  Any possible doubt about this point has been removed by the statutory procedure Congress has provided for the disposition of ha-beas corpus petitions, a procedure including such nonappel-late functions as the allegation of facts, 28 U. S. C. § 2242 , the taking of depositions and the propounding of interrogatories, § 2246, the introduction of documentary evidence, § 2247, and, of course, the determination of facts at evidentiary hearings, § 2254(d).  To be sure, habeas corpus has its own peculiar set of hurdles a petitioner must clear before his claim is properly presented to the district court. The petitioner must, in general, exhaust available state remedies, § 2254(b), avoid procedural default, Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), not abuse the writ, McCleskey v. Zant, <citedDecision>499 U. S. 467</citedDecision> (1991), and not seek retroactive application of a new rule of law, Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).  For much of our history, the hurdles were even higher.  See, e. g., Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 203 (1830) (habeas corpus available only to challenge jurisdiction of trial court).  But once they have been surmounted — once the claim is properly before the dis *15 trict court — a habeas petitioner, like any civil litigant, has had a right to a hearing where one is necessary to prove the facts supporting his claim.  See, e. g., Hawk v. Olson, 326 U. S. 271, 278-279 (1945); Holiday v. Johnston, 313 U. S. 342, 351-354 (1941); Walker v. Johnston, 312 U. S. 275, 285-287 (1941); Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86, 92 (1923).  Thus when we observed in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S., at 312, that “the opportunity for redress ... presupposes the opportunity to be heard, to argue and present evidence,” we were saying nothing new.  We were merely restating what had long been our understanding of the method by which contested factual issues raised on habeas should be resolved.

 Even before Townsend , when a habeas petitioner’s claim was properly before a federal court, and when the accurate resolution of that claim depended on proof of facts that had been resolved against the petitioner in an unreliable state proceeding, the petitioner was entitled to his day in federal court. As Justice Holmes wrote for the Court, in a case where the state courts had rejected — under somewhat suspicious circumstances — the petitioner’s allegation that his trial had been dominated by an angry mob: “[I]t does not seem to us sufficient to allow a Judge of the United States to escape the duty of examining the facts for himself when if true as alleged they make the trial absolutely void.” Moore, 261 U. S., at 92 .  The class of petitioners eligible to present claims on habeas may have been narrower in days gone by, and the class of claims one might present may have *19 been smaller, but once the claim was properly before the court, the right to a hearing was not construed as narrowly as the Court construes it today.  B Instead of looking to the history of the right to an eviden-tiary hearing, the Court simply borrows the cause and prejudice standard from a series of our recent habeas corpus cases. Ante, at 5-8.  All but one of these cases address the question of when a habeas claim is properly before a federal court despite the petitioner’s procedural default.  See Coleman v. Thompson, supra; Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986); Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1 (1984); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107 (1982); Wainwright v. Sykes, supra; Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976).  The remaining case addresses the issue of a petitioner’s abuse of the writ.  See McCleskey v. Zant, <citedDecision>499 U. S. 467</citedDecision> (1991).  These cases all concern the question whether the federal court will consider the merits of the claim, that is, whether the court has the authority to upset a judgment affirmed on direct appeal.  So far as this threshold inquiry is concerned, our respect for state procedural rules and the need to discourage abuse of the writ provide the justification for the cause and prejudice standard.  As we have said in the former context: “[T]he Great Writ imposes special costs on our federal system.  The States possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law. In criminal trials they also hold the initial responsibility for vindicating constitutional rights.  Federal intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate both the States’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.” Engle, supra, at 128 .  The question we are considering here is quite different.
