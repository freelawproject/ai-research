 Not one is shown by the record here to be the official manual of any police department, much less in universal use in crime detection.  Moreover, the examples of police brutality mentioned by the Court 2 are rare exceptions to the thousands of cases *500 that appear every year in the law reports. The police agencies — all the way from municipal and state forces to the federal bureaus — are responsible for law enforcement and public safety in this country.  I am proud of their efforts, which in my view are not fairly characterized by the Court’s opinion.  I.  The ipse dixit of the majority has no support in our cases. Indeed, the Court admits that “we might not find the defendants’ statements [here] to have been involuntary in traditional terms.” Ante, p. 457.  In short, the Court has added more to the requirements that the accused is entitled to consult with his lawyer and that he must be given the traditional warning that he may remain silent and that anything that he says may be used against him.  Escobedo v. Illinois, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 478, 490-491</citedDecision> (1964).  Now, the Court fashions a constitutional rule that the police may engage in no custodial interrogation without additionally advising the accused that he has a right under the Fifth Amendment to the presence of counsel during interrogation and that, if he is without funds, counsel will be furnished him.  When at any point during an interrogation the accused seeks affirmatively or impliedly to invoke his rights to silence or counsel, interrogation must be forgone or postponed.  The Court further holds that failure to follow the new procedures requires inexorably the exclusion of any statement by the accused, as well as the fruits thereof.  Such a strict constitutional specific inserted at the nerve center of crime detection may well kill the patient.  3 *501 Since there is at this time a paucity of information and an almost total lack of empirical knowledge on the practical operation of requirements truly comparable to those announced by the majority, I would be more restrained lest we go too far too fast.  II.  Custodial interrogation has long been recognized as “undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement.” Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 515 (1963).  Recognition of this fact should put us on guard against the promulgation of doctrinaire rules.  Especially is this true where the Court finds that “the Constitution has prescribed” its holding and where the light of our past cases, from Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574 , (1884), down to Haynes v. Washington, supra, is to *502 the contrary.  Indeed, even in <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> the Court never hinted that an affirmative “waiver” was a prerequisite to questioning; that the burden of proof as to waiver was on the prosecution; that the presence of counsel— absent a waiver — during interrogation was required; that a waiver can be withdrawn at the will of the accused; that counsel must be furnished during an accusatory stage to those unable to pay; nor that admissions and exculpatory statements are “confessions.” To require all those things at one gulp should cause the Court to choke over more cases than Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958), and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 (1958), which it expressly overrules today.  The rule prior to today — as Mr. Justice Goldberg, the author of the Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> , stated it in Haynes v. Washington — depended upon “a totality of circumstances evidencing an involuntary .  .  .  admission of guilt.” 373 U. S., at 514 .  And he concluded: “Of course, detection and solution of crime is, at best, a difficult and arduous task requiring determination and persistence on the part of all responsible officers charged with the duty of law enforcement.  And, certainly, we do not mean to suggest that all interrogation of witnesses and suspects is impermissible.  Such questioning is undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement.

 While a later case said the Fifth Amendment privilege controlled admissibility, this proposition was not itself developed in subsequent decisions.  2 The Court did, however, heighten the test of admissibility in federal trials to one of voluntariness “in fact,” Wan v. *507 United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14 (quoted, ante, p. 462), and then by and large left federal judges to apply the same standards the Court began to derive in a string of state court cases. This new line of decisions, testing admissibility by the Due Process Clause, began in 1936 with Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 , and must now embrace somewhat more than 30 full opinions of the Court. 3 While the voluntariness rubric was repeated in many instances, e. g., Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U. S. 596 , the Court never pinned it down to a single meaning but on the contrary infused it with a number of different values.  To travel quickly over the main themes, there was an initial emphasis on reliability, e. g., Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S. 547 , supplemented by concern over the legality and fairness of the police practices, e. g., Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 , in an “accusatorial” system of law enforcement, Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 54 , and eventually by close attention to the individual’s state of mind and capacity for effective choice, e. g., Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49 .  The outcome was a continuing re-evaluation on the facts of each case of how much pressure on the suspect was permissible.  4 *508 Among the criteria often taken into account were threats or imminent danger, e. g., Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560 , physical deprivations such as lack of sleep or food, e. g., Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433 , repeated or extended interrogation, e. g., Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227 , limits on access to counsel or friends, Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 ; Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , length and illegality of detention under state law, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 , and individual weakness or incapacities, Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 .  Apart from direct physical coercion, however, no single default or fixed combination of defaults guaranteed exclusion, and synopses of the cases would serve little use because the overall gauge has been steadily changing, usually in the direction of restricting admissibility.  But to mark just what point had been reached before the Court jumped the rails in Escobedo v. Illinois, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 478</citedDecision> , it is worth capsulizing the then-recent case of Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 .  There, Haynes had been held some 16 or more hours in violation of state law before signing the disputed confession, had received no warnings of any kind, and despite requests had been refused access to his wife or to counsel, the police indicating that access would be allowed after a confession.  Emphasizing especially this last inducement and rejecting some contrary indicia of voluntariness, the Court in a 5-to-4 decision held the confession inadmissible.  There are several relevant lessons to be drawn from this constitutional history.  The first is that with over 25 years of precedent the Court has developed an elaborate, sophisticated, and sensitive approach to.  admissibility of confessions.  It is “judicial” in its treatment of one case at a time, see Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 635 (concurring opinion of The Chief Justice), flexible in its ability to respond to the endless mutations of fact presented, and ever more familiar to the lower courts.

 6 *511 Even those who would readily enlarge the privilege must concede some linguistic difficulties since the Fifth Amendment in terms proscribes only compelling any person “in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” Cf. Kamisar, Equal Justice in the Gatehouses and Mansions of American Criminal Procedure, in Criminal Justice in Our Time 1, 25-26 (1965).  Though weighty, I do not say these points and similar ones are conclusive, for, as the Court reiterates, the privilege embodies basic principles always capable of expansion.  7 Certainly the privilege does represent a protective concern for the accused and an emphasis upon accusatorial rather than inquisitorial values in law enforcement, although this is similarly true of other limitations such as the grand jury requirement and the reasonable doubt standard.  Accusatorial values, however, have openly been absorbed into the due process standard governing confessions; this indeed is why at present “the kinship of the two rules [governing confessions and self-incrimination] is too apparent for denial.” McCormick, Evidence 155 (1954).  Since extension of the general principle has already occurred, to insist that the privilege applies as such serves only to carry over inapposite historical details and engaging rhetoric and to obscure the policy choices to be made in regulating confessions.  Having decided that the Fifth Amendment privilege does apply in the police station, the Court reveals that the privilege imposes more exacting restrictions than does the Fourteenth Amendment’s voluntariness test.  8 *512 It then emerges from a discussion of <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> that the Fifth Amendment requires for an admissible confession that it be given by one distinctly aware of his right not to speak and shielded from “the compelling atmosphere” of interrogation.  See ante, pp. 465-466.  From these key premises, the Court finally develops the safeguards of warning, counsel, and so forth.  I do not believe these premises are sustained by precedents under the Fifth Amendment.  9 The more important premise is that pressure on the suspect must be eliminated though it be only the subtle influence of the atmosphere and surroundings.  The Fifth Amendment, however, has never been thought to forbid all pressure to incriminate one’s self in the situations covered by it.  On the contrary, it has been held that failure to incriminate one’s self can result in denial of removal of one’s case from state to federal court, Maryland v. Soper, 270 U. S. 9 ; in refusal of a military commission, Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U. S. 83 ; in denial of a discharge in bankruptcy, Kaufman v. Hurwitz, 176 F. 2d 210 ; and in numerous other adverse consequences.

 No Fifth Amendment precedent is cited for the Court’s contrary view.  There might of course be reasons apart from Fifth Amendment precedent for requiring warning or any other safeguard on questioning but that is a different matter entirely.  See infra, pp. 516-517.  A closing word must be said about the Assistance of Counsel Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which is never expressly relied on by the Court but whose judicial precedents turn out to be linchpins of the confession rules announced today.  To support its requirement of a knowing and intelligent waiver, the Court cites Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 , ante, p. 475; appointment of counsel for the indigent suspect is tied to Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 , and Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 , ante, p. 473; the silent-record doctrine is borrowed from Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U. S. 506 , ante, p. 475, as is the right to an express offer of counsel, ante, p. 471.  All these cases imparting glosses to the Sixth Amendment concerned counsel at trial or on appeal.  While the Court finds no pertinent difference between judicial proceedings and police interrogation, I believe *514 the differences are so vast as to disqualify wholly the Sixth Amendment precedents as suitable analogies in the present cases. 10 The only attempt in this Court to carry the right to counsel into the station house occurred in <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> , the Court repeating several times that that stage was no less “critical” than trial itself.  See 378 U. S., 485 -488.  This is hardly persuasive when we consider that a grand jury inquiry, the filing of a certiorari petition, and certainly the purchase of narcotics by an undercover agent from a prospective defendant may all be equally “critical” yet provision of counsel and advice on that score have never been thought compelled by the Constitution in such cases. The sound reason why this right is so freely extended for a criminal trial is the severe injustice risked by confronting an untrained defendant with a range of technical points of law, evidence, and tactics familiar to the prosecutor but not to-himself.  This danger shrinks markedly in the police station where indeed the lawyer in fulfilling his professional responsibilities of necessity may become an obstacle to truthfinding.  See infra, n. 12.  The Court’s summary citation of the Sixth Amendment cases here seems to me best described as “the domino method of constitutional adjudication .  .

 Among the examples given in 8 Wigmore, Evidence § 2266, at 401 (McNaughton rev. 1961), are these: the privilege applies to any witness, civil or criminal, but the confession rule protects only criminal defendants; the privilege deals only with compulsion, while the confession rule may exclude statements obtained by trick or promise; and where the privilege has been nullified — as by the English Bankruptcy Act — the confession rule may still operate.  Additionally, there are precedents and even historical arguments that can be arrayed in favor of bringing extra-legal questioning within the privilege.  See generally Maguire, Evidence of Guilt §2.03, at 15-16 (1959).  This, of course, is implicit in the Court’s introductory announcement that “[o]ur decision in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964) [extending the Fifth Amendment privilege to the States] necessitates *512 an examination of the scope of the privilege in state cases as well.” Ante, p. 463.  It is also inconsistent with Malloy itself, in which extension of the Fifth Amendment to the States rested in part on the view that the Due Process Clause restriction on state confessions has in recent years been “the same standard” as that imposed in federal prosecutions assertedly bv the Fifth Amendment.  378 U. S., at 7.  I lay aside <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> itself; it contains no reasoning or even general conclusions addressed to the Fifth Amendment and indeed its citation in this regard seems surprising in view of Escobedo’s primary reliance on the Sixth Amendment.  Since the Court conspicuously does not assert that the Sixth Amendment itself warrants its new police-interrogation rules, there is no reason now to draw out the extremely powerful historical and precedential evidence that the Amendment will bear no such meaning.  See generally Friendly, The Bill of Rights as a Code of Criminal Procedure, 53 Calif. L. Rev. 929 , 943-948 (1965).  See supra, n. 4, and text.  Of course, the use of terms like voluntariness involves questions of law and terminology quite as much as questions of fact.  See Collins v. Beto, 348 F. 2d 823, 832 (concurring opinion); Bator & Vorenberg, supra, n. 4, at 72-73.  The Court’s vision of a lawyer “mitigat[ing] the dangers of un-trustworthiness” (ante, p. 470) by witnessing coercion and assisting accuracy in the confession is largely a fancy; for if counsel arrives, there is rarely going to be a police station confession.
