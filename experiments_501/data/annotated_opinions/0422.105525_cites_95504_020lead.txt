 .  .  .  The fact that an instrument drawn with such meticulous care and by men who so well understood how to make language fit their thought does not contain any such limiting phrase ... is persuasive evidence that no qualification was intended.” According to Madison, the section was intended “to provide for trial by jury of offences committed out of any State.” 3 Madison Papers (Gilpin ed. 1841) 1441.  1 Stat. 113 -114.  With slight modifications this provision is now 18 U. S. C. § 3238 .  See, e. g., Balzac v. Porto Rico, 268 U. S. 298, 312-313 (Due Process of Law); Downes v. Bidwett, <citedDecision>182 U. S. 244, 277</citedDecision> (First Amendment, Prohibition against Ex Post Facto Laws or Bills of *9 Attainder); Mitchell v. Harmony, 13 How. 115, 134 (Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment); Best v. United States, 184 F. 2d 131, 138 (Fourth Amendment); Eisentrager v. Forrestal, 84 U. S. App. D. C. 396, 174 F. 2d 961 (Right to Habeas Corpus), rev’d on other grounds sub nom. Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763 ; Turney v. United States, 126 Ct. Cl. 202 , 115 F. Supp. 457, 464 (Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment).  See Dorr v. United States, 195 U. S. 138, 144-148 .  The right to trial by jury in a criminal case is twice guaranteed by the Constitution.  It is common knowledge that the fear that jury trial might be abolished was one of the principal sources of objection to the Federal Constitution and was an important reason for the adoption of the Bill of Rights.  The Sixth Amendment reaffirmed the right to trial by jury in criminal cases and the Seventh Amendment insured such trial in civil controversies.  See 2 Elliot’s Debates (2d ed. 1836) passim; 3 id. passim.  3 Blackstone’s Commentaries 379.

 Id., §4086.  Secretary of State Blaine referred to these consular powers as “greater than ever the Roman law conferred on the pro-consuls of the empire, to an officer who, under the terms of the commitment of this astounding trust, is practically irresponsible.” S. Exec. Doc. No. 21, 47th Cong., 1st Sess. 4.  Seward, at a time when he was Consul-General, declared: “[t]here is no reason, excepting the absence of appropriate legislation, why American citizens in China, charged with grave offenses, should not have the privilege of a trial by jury as elsewhere throughout the world where the institution of civilization prevails.” Id., at 7.  In re Ross, supra, at 464 .  Ibid. See cases cited in note 10, supra. See, e. g., Kawakita v. United States, 343 U. S. 717 ; United States v. Flores, 289 U. S. 137 ; United States v. Bowman, 260 U. S. 94 ; Chandler v. United States, 171 F. 2d 921 , cert. denied, 336 U. S. 918 .  70 Stat. 773 .  Downes v. Bidwell, <citedDecision>182 U. S. 244</citedDecision> ; Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U.

Bidwell, <citedDecision>182 U. S. 244</citedDecision> , the first of the “Insular Cases” was decided over vigorous dissents from Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, joined by Justices Harlan, Brewer, and Peckham, and from Mr. Justice Harlan separately.  The four dissenters took the position that all the restraints of the Bill of Rights and of other parts of the Constitution were applicable to the United States Government wherever it acted.  This was the position which the Court had consistently followed prior to the “Insular Cases.” See, e. g., Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 ; Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540 .  As to the great significance of the right to trial by jury see text at note 13, supra, and the authorities referred to in that note.  Later the Court held that once a territory become “incorporated” all of the constitutional protections became “applicable.” See, e. g., Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U. S. 516, 520-521 .  It may be said that it is difficult to amend the Constitution.  To some extent that is true.
