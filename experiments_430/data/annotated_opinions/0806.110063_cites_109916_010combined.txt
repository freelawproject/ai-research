 .  .  If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree.  And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities." (Citations omitted.) This formulation was employed only last Term to strike down New Jersey's attempt to "conserve" the natural resource of landfill areas within the State for the disposal of waste generated within the State.  Philadelphia v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>437 U. S. 617, 624</citedDecision> (1978).  The Geer analysis has also been eroded to the point of virtual extinction in cases involving regulation of wild animals.  The first challenge to Geer 's theory of a State's power over wild animals came in Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920).  The State of Missouri, relying on the theory of state ownership of wild animals, attacked the Migratory Bird Treaty Act on the ground that it interfered with the State's control over wild animals within its boundaries.  Writing for the Court, Mr. Justice Holmes upheld the Act as a proper *332 exercise of the treatymaking power.  He commented in passing on the artificiality of the Geer rationale: "To put the claim of the State upon title is to lean upon a slender reed." 252 U. S., at 434 .

 .  is demonstrated, the burden falls on the State to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of non-discriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve the local interests at stake." Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 353 (1977).  Furthermore, when considering the purpose of a challenged statute, this Court is not bound by "[t]he name, description or characterization given it by the legislature or the courts of the State," but will determine for itself the practical impact of the law. Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545, 550 (1924); see Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S., at 10 ; Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., supra .  Section 4-115 (B) on its face discriminates against interstate commerce.  It forbids the transportation of natural minnows *337 out of the State for purposes of sale, and thus "overtly blocks the flow of interstate commerce at [the] State's borders." <citedDecision>Philadelphia</citedDecision> v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>437 U. S., at 624</citedDecision> .  Such facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect, regardless of the State's purpose, because "the evil of protectionism can reside in legislative means as well as legislative ends." <citedDecision>Id., at 626</citedDecision> .  [17] At a minimum such facial discrimination invokes the strictest scrutiny of any purported legitimate local purpose and of the absence of nondiscriminatory alternatives.  Oklahoma argues that § 4-115 (B) serves a legitimate local purpose in that it is "readily apparent as a conservation measure." Brief for Appellee 8.  The State's interest in maintaining the ecological balance in state waters by avoiding the removal of inordinate numbers of minnows may well qualify as a legitimate local purpose.  We consider the State's interests in conservation and protection of wild animals as legitimate local purposes similar to the States' interests in protecting the health and safety of their citizens.  See, e. g., Firemen v. Chicago, R. I.

 Section 4-115 (B) is part of the Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Code. Another provision of that Code requires that persons have a minnow dealer's license before they can lawfully seine or trap minnows within the Stateexcept for their own use as bait§ 4-116 (Supp. 1978), but no limit is imposed on the number of minnows a licensed dealer may take from state waters.  Nor is there any regulation except § 4-115 (B) concerning the disposition of lawfully acquired minnows; they may be sold within Oklahoma to any person and for any purpose, and may be taken out of the State for any purpose except sale.  [2]  "The Commerce Clause is one of the most prolific sources of national power and an equally prolific source of conflict with legislation of the state.  While the Constitution vests in Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, it does not say what the states may or may not do in the absence of congressional action, nor how to draw the line between what is and what is not commerce among the states.  Perhaps even more than by interpretation of its written word, this Court has advanced the solidarity and prosperity of this Nation by the meaning it has given to these great silences of the Constitution." H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S., at 534-535 .  Philadelphia v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>437 U. S. 617, 621-623</citedDecision> (1978), made clear that there is no "two-tiered definition of commerce." The definition of "commerce" is the same when relied on to strike down or restrict state legislation as when relied on to support some exertion of federal control or regulation.  [3]  See, e. g., Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 209 (1824); Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 (1829); Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1852); Port Richmond & Bergen Point Ferry Co. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, 234 U. S. 317 (1914); Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, 273 U. S. 34 (1927); Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943); Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761 (1945); H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, supra ; Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137 (1970).  See generally, F. Frankfurter, The Commerce Clause Under Marshall, Taney and Waite (1937); Dowling, Interstate Commerce and State Power, 27 Va. L. Rev. 1 (1940); Dowling, Interstate Commerce and State PowerRevised Version, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 547 (1947).  [4]  "[T]he sole issue which the case presents is, was it lawful under the Constitution of the United States (section 8, Article I) for the State of Connecticut to allow the killing of birds within the State during a designated open season, to allow such birds, when so killed, to be used, to be sold and to be bought for use within the State, and yet to forbid their transportation beyond the State?  Or, to state it otherwise, had the State of Connecticut the power to regulate the killing of game within her b orders so as to confine its use to the limits of the State and forbid its transmission outside of the State?" 161 U. S., at 522 .
**Combined Opinion**
 the Court has recognized that the States' interest in regulating and controlling those things they claim to `own,' including wildlife, is by no means absolute.  States may not compel the confinement of the benefits of their resources, even their wildlife, to their own people whenever such hoarding and confinement impedes interstate commerce.  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928); Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923); West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911)." Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, 436 U. S. 371, 385-386 (1978).  [16]  See, e. g., Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 , 285 n. 21 (1977).  [17]  "[W]hatever [a State's] ultimate purpose, it may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently." <citedDecision>Philadelphia</citedDecision> v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>437 U. S., at 626-627</citedDecision> .  [18]  See n. 1, supra. [19]  Section 4-115 (B) does not apply to persons transporting three dozen or less natural minnows outside the State.  See n. 1, supra. [20]  In its brief, Oklahoma argues, apparently for the first time, that the discrimination against out-of-state sales of natural minnows is justified because minnows purchased in the State are more likely to be used for bait in state waters.  Brief for Appellee 3.  The State contends that minnows "returned" to state waters as bait do not upset the ecological balance as much as those that never "return." The late appearance of this argument and the total absence of any record support for the questionable factual assumptions that underlie it give it the flavor of a post hoc rationalization.  The State's bare assertion is certainly inadequate to survive the scrutiny invoked by the facial discrimination of § 4-115 (B).
