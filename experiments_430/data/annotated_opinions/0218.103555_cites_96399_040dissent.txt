**Dissenting Opinion**
 This appears particularly from their reliance upon French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250 ; Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U. S. 494 ; and Sharon v. Terry, 36 F. 337 .  In the French case no res was involved.  It was a federal injunction against the enforcement of a judgment of a state court obtained in a state action after removal of a related but separate state suit.  The reasoning proceeded upon the protection of federal judgments, not on the language of the removal statute.  The same is true of Dietzsch .  There a state suit on a replevin bond was enjoined by the federal court because it grew out of a failure to return property awarded in replevin in a state court after the removal of the original replevin suit to the federal court which issued the injunction.  It was there said, p. 497: “A court of the United States is not prevented from enforcing its own judgments by the statute which forbids it to grant a writ of injunction to stay proceedings in a State court.” *149 The Court today lays aside Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, <citedDecision>200 U. S. 273</citedDecision> (1906), as inapplicable.  The case in our view may be properly cited as a relitigation decision.  It forcefully declares, albeit by alternative ruling, for the position here taken.  A federal court had enjoined a state tax on the ground of unconstitutionality.  The state was a party.  Years later the state brought an action in the state court for the tax which the decree prohibited.  An ancillary bill sought and obtained an injunction from the federal court. This Court said, p. 292, “Indeed, the proposition that the Eleventh Amendment, or section 720 of the Revised Statutes, control a court of the United States in administering relief, although the court was acting in a matter ancillary to a decree rendered in a cause over which it had jurisdiction, is not open for discussion.
