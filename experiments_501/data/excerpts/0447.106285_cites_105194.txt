 .  .  .” People v. Cohan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445 , 282 P. 2d 905, 911 (1955).  In connection with this California case, we note that the second basis elaborated in Wolf in support of its failure to enforce the exclusionary doctrine against the States was that “other means of protection” have been afforded “the *652 right to privacy.” 7 338 U. S., at 30 .  The experience of California that such other remedies have been worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other States.  The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been *653 recognized by this Court since Wolf .  See Irvine v. California, <citedDecision>347 U. S. 128, 137</citedDecision> (1954).  Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the “weighty testimony” of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13 , 150 N. E. 585 (1926).  There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the Weeks exclusionary rule in New York, had said that “[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax.” 242 N. Y., at 22 , 150 N. E., at 588 .  However, the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court. These include the recent discarding of the “silver platter” doctrine which allowed federal judicial use.  of evidence seized in violation of the Constitution by state agents, Elkins v. United States, supra; the relaxation of the formerly strict requirements as to standing to challenge the use of evidence thus seized, so that now the procedure of exclusion, “ultimately referable to constitutional safeguards;” is available to anyone even “legitimately on [the] premises” unlawfully searched, Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, 266-267 (1960); and, finally, the formulation of a method to prevent state use of evidence unconstitutionally seized by federal agents, Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 (1956).  Because there can be no fixed formula, we are admittedly met with “recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches,” but less is not to be expected when dealing with a Constitution, and, at any rate, “ [r] easonableness is in the first instance for the [trial court] ... to determine.” United States v. Rabinowits, 339 U. S. 56, 63 (1950).  It, therefore, plainly appears that the factual considerations supporting the failure of the Wolf Court to include the Weeks exclusionary rule when it recognized the enforceability of the right to privacy against the States in 1949, while not basically relevant to the constitutional consideration, could not, in any analysis, now be deemed controlling.  *654 III. Some five years after Wolf , in answer to a plea made here Term after Term that we overturn its doctrine on applicability of the Weeks exclusionary rule, this Court indicated that such should not be done until the States had “adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the [Weeks] rule.” <citedDecision>Irvine</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>California, supra, at 134</citedDecision> .  There again it was said: “Never until June of 1949 did this Court hold the basic search-and-seizure prohibition in any way applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> And only last Term, after again carefully re-examining the Wolf doctrine in Elkins v. United States, supra, the Court pointed out that “the controlling principles” as to search and seizure and the problem of admissibility “seemed clear” (at p. 212) until the announcement in Wolf “that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not itself require state courts to adopt the exclusionary rule” of the Weeks case. At p. 213.  At the same time, the Court pointed out, “the underlying constitutional doctrine which Wolf established .  .  .  that the Federal Constitution .  .  .

See note 7, supra. Instead it held that “If anyone looks at a book and finds it lewd, he is forthwith, under this legislation, guilty .  .  .  .” See Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S., at 39-40 ; Irvine v. California, <citedDecision>347 U. S. 128, 133-134</citedDecision> , and at 138-139.  In the latter case, decided in 1954, Mr. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority, said (at p. 134): “We think that the Wolf decision should not be overruled, for the reasons so persuasively stated therein.” Compare Schwartz v. Texas, 344 U. S. 199 , and Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 , in which the Wolf case was discussed and in no way disapproved.  And see Pugach v. Dollinger, 365 U. S. 458 , which relied on Schwartz .  Actually, only four members of the majority support this reasoning.  See pp. 685-686, infra.  Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 ; Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253 .  My Brother Stewart concurs in the Court’s judgment on grounds which have nothing to do with Wolf .
