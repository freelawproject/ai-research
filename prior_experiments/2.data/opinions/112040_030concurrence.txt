<p id="b599-10">Although the Court properly finds support for its holding in <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, </em><page-number citation-index="1" label="528">*528</page-number>469 U. S. 528 (1985), the outcome of this case was equally clear well before that case was decided. See <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>465 U. S. 367, 403-419 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It should be emphasized, however, that neither the Courtâ€™s decision today, nor what I have written in the past, expresses any opinion about the wisdom of taxing the interest on bonds issued by state or local governments.</p>
