New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 , 266 *759 (1964); Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S., at 533 ; Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, 111 (1943); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413, 417 (1943).  Since the decision in Breard , however, the Court has never denied protection on the ground that the speech in issue was "commercial speech." That simplistic approach, which by then had come under criticism or was regarded as of doubtful validity by Members of the Court, [16] was avoided in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S. 376 (1973).  There the Court upheld an ordinance prohibiting newspapers from listing employment advertisements in columns according to whether male or female employees were sought to be hired.  The Court, to be sure, characterized the advertisements as "classic examples of commercial speech," id., at 385 , and a newspaper's printing of the advertisements as of the same character.  The Court, however, upheld the ordinance on the ground that the restriction it imposed was permissible because the discriminatory hirings proposed by the advertisements, and by their newspaper layout, were themselves illegal.  Last Term, in Bigelow v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 809</citedDecision> (1975), the notion of unprotected "commercial speech" all but passed from the scene.  We reversed a conviction for violation of a Virginia statute that made the circulation of any publication to encourage or promote the *760 processing of an abortion in Virginia a misdemeanor.  The defendant had published in his newspaper the availability of abortions in New York. The advertisement in question, in addition to announcing that abortions were legal in New York, offered the services of a referral agency in that State.  We rejected the contention that the publication was unprotected because it was commercial.  Chrestensen 's continued validity was questioned, and its holding was described as "distinctly a limited one" that merely upheld "a reasonable regulation of the manner in which commercial advertising could be distributed." <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 819</citedDecision> .  We concluded that "the Virginia courts erred in their assumptions that advertising, as such, was entitled to no First Amendment protection," and we observed that the "relationship of speech to the marketplace of products or of services does not make it valueless in the marketplace of ideas." <citedDecision>Id., at 825-826</citedDecision> .  Some fragment of hope for the continuing validity of a "commercial speech" exception arguably might have persisted because of the subject matter of the advertisement in <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> .  We noted that in announcing the availability of legal abortions in New York, the advertisement "did more than simply propose a commercial transaction.  It contained factual material of clear `public interest.' " <citedDecision>Id., at 822</citedDecision> .  And, of course, the advertisement related to activity with which, at least in some respects, the State could not interfere.  See Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179 (1973).  Indeed, we observed: "We need not decide in this case the precise extent to which the First Amendment permits regulation of advertising that is related to activities the State may legitimately regulate or even prohibit." <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 825</citedDecision> .  Here, in contrast, the question whether there is a First Amendment exception for "commercial speech" is *761 squarely before us.  Our pharmacist does not wish to editorialize on any subject, cultural, philosophical, or political.  He does not wish to report any particularly newsworthy fact, or to make generalized observations even about commercial matters.  The "idea" he wishes to communicate is simply this: "I will sell you the X prescription drug at the Y price." Our question, then, is whether this communication is wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment.  V We begin with several propositions that already are settled or beyond serious dispute.

 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra ; NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 429 (1963); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S., at 417 ; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 306-307 (1940).  If there is a kind of commercial speech that lacks all First Amendment protection, therefore, it must be distinguished by its content.  Yet the speech whose content deprives it of protection cannot simply be speech on a commercial subject.  No one would contend that our pharmacist may be prevented from being heard on *762 the subject of whether, in general, pharmaceutical prices should be regulated, or their advertisement forbidden.  Nor can it be dispositive that a commercial advertisement is noneditorial, and merely reports a fact.  Purely factual matter of public interest may claim protection.  <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 822</citedDecision> ; Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 102 (1940).  Our question is whether speech which does "no more than propose a commercial transaction," Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S., at 385 , is so removed from any "exposition of ideas," Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572 (1942), and from " `truth, science, morality, and arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on the administration of Government,' " Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957), that it lacks all protection.  Our answer is that it is not.  Focusing first on the individual parties to the transaction that is proposed in the commercial advertisement, we may assume that the advertiser's interest is a purely economic one.  That hardly disqualifies him from protection under the First Amendment.  The interests of the Contestants in a labor dispute are primarily economic, but it has long been settled that both the employee and the employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome.  See e. g., NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575, 617-618 (1969); NLRB v. Virginia Electric & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477 (1941); AFL v. Swing, 312 U. S. 321, 325-326 (1941); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S., at 102 .

 Those whom the suppression of prescription drug price information hits the hardest are the poor, the sick, and particularly the aged.  A disproportionate amount of their income tends to be spent on prescription drugs; yet they are the least able to learn, by shopping from pharmacist to pharmacist, where their scarce dollars are best spent.  [18] When drug prices *764 vary as strikingly as they do, information as to who is charging what becomes more than a convenience.  It could mean the alleviation of physical pain or the enjoyment of basic necessities.  Generalizing, society also may have a strong interest in the free flow of commercial information.  Even an individual advertisement, though entirely "commercial," may be of general public interest.  The facts of decided cases furnish illustrations: advertisements stating that referral services for legal abortions are available, <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> v. Virginia, supra ; that a manufacturer of artificial furs promotes his product as an alternative to the extinction by his competitors of fur-bearing mammals, see Fur Information & Fashion Council, Inc. v. E. F. Timme & Son, 364 F. Supp. 16 (SDNY 1973); and that a domestic producer advertises his product as an alternative to imports that tend to deprive American residents of their jobs, cf. Chicago Joint Board v. Chicago Tribune Co., 435 F. 2d 470 (CA7 1970), cert. denied, 402 U. S. 973 (1971).  Obviously, not all commercial messages contain the same or even a very great public interest element.  There are few to which such an element, however, could not be added.  Our pharmacist, for example, could cast himself as a commentator on store-to-store disparities *765 in drug prices, giving his own and those of a competitor as proof.  We see little point in requiring him to do so, and little difference if he does not.  Moreover, there is another consideration that suggests that no line between publicly "interesting" or "important" commercial advertising and the opposite kind could ever be drawn.  Advertising, however tasteless and excessive it sometimes may seem, is nonetheless dissemination of information as to who is producing and selling what product, for what reason, and at what price.

 See ante, at 771-772, n. 24.  Ideological expression, be it oral, literary, pictorial, or theatrical, is integrally related to the exposition of thoughtÂ—thought that may shape our concepts of the whole universe of man.  Although such expression may convey factual information relevant to social and individual decisionmaking, it is protected by *780 the Constitution, whether or not it contains factual representations and even if it includes inaccurate assertions of fact.  Indeed, disregard of the "truth" may be employed to give force to the underlying idea expressed by the speaker.  [6] "Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea," and the only way that ideas can be suppressed is through "the competition of other ideas," Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S., at 339-340 .  Commercial price and product advertising differs markedly from ideological expression because it is confined to the promotion of specific goods or services.  [7] The First Amendment protects the advertisement because of the "information of potential interest and value" conveyed, Bigelow v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 809, 822</citedDecision> , rather than because of any direct contribution to the interchange of ideas.  See ante, at 762-765, 770.  [8] Since the factual claims contained in commercial price or product advertisements relate to tangible goods or services, they may be tested empirically and corrected to reflect the truth without in any manner jeopardizing the free dissemination *781 of thought.  Indeed, the elimination of false and deceptive claims serves to promote the one facet of commercial price and product advertising that warrants First Amendment protectionÂ—its contribution to the flow of accurate and reliable information relevant to public and private decisionmaking.  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.  The logical consequences of the Court's decision in this case, a decision which elevates commercial intercourse between a seller hawking his wares and a buyer seeking to strike a bargain to the same plane as has been previously reserved for the free marketplace of ideas, are far reaching indeed.  Under the Court's opinion the way will be open not only for dissemination of price information but for active promotion of prescription drugs, liquor, cigarettes, and other products the use of which it has previously been thought desirable to discourage.

Here the rights of the appellees seem to me to be marginal at best.  There is no ideological content to the information which they seek and it is freely available to themÂ—they may even publish it if they so desire.  The only persons directly affected by this statute are not parties to this lawsuit.  On the other hand, the societal interest against the promotion of drug use for every ill, real or imaginary, seems to me extremely strong.  I do not believe that the First Amendment mandates the Court's "open door policy" toward such commercial advertising.  NOTES [*]  Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed by Alfred Miller and Stephen L. Solomon for the American Association of Retired Persons et al.; by Gilbert H. Weil, Philip B. Kurland, and Alan L. Unikel for the Association of National Advertisers, Inc.; and by Harold Rosenwald for Osco Drug, Inc. [1]  The First Amendment is applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See, e. g., Bigelow v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 809, 811</citedDecision> (1975); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147, 160 (1939).  [2]  Section 54-524.35 provides in full: "Any pharmacist shall be considered guilty of unprofessional conduct who (1) is found guilty of any crime involving grave moral turpitude, or is guilty of fraud or deceit in obtaining a certificate of registration; or (2) issues, publishes, broadcasts by radio, or otherwise, or distributes or uses in any way whatsoever advertising matter in which statements are made about his professional service which have a tendency to deceive or defraud the public, contrary to the public health and welfare; or (3) publishes, advertises or promotes, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, any amount, price, fee, premium, discount, rebate or credit terms for professional services or for drugs containing narcotics or for any drugs which may be dispensed only by prescription." [3]  The parties, also, have stipulated that pharmacy "is a profession." Stipulation of Facts Â¶ 11, App. 11.  [4] Id., Â¶ 8, App. 11.  See generally id., Â¶Â¶ 6-16, App. 10-12.

 We are aware of no general principle that freedom of speech may be abridged when the speaker's listeners could come by his message by some other means, such as seeking him out and asking him what it is.  Nor have we recognized any such limitation on the independent right of the listener to receive the information sought to be communicated.  Certainly, the recipients of the political publications in Lamont could have gone abroad and thereafter disseminated them themselves.  Those in Kleindienst who organized the lecture tour by a foreign Marxist could have done the same.  And the addressees of the inmate correspondence in Procunier could have visited the prison themselves.  As for the recipients' great need for the information sought to be disseminated, if it distinguishes our prior cases at all, it makes the appellees' First Amendment claim a stronger rather than a weaker one.  [16]  See <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> v. Virginia, 421 U. S., at 820 n. 6, citing Mr. Justice Douglas' observation in Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S. 498, 514 (1959) (concurring opinion), that the Chrestensen ruling "was casual, almost offhand.  And it has not survived reflection"; the similar observation of four Justices in dissent in Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298 , 314 n. 6 (1974); and expressions of three Justices in separate dissents in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S., at 393, 398 , and 401.  See also Mr. Justice Douglas' comment, dissenting from the denial of certiorari in Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (1971).  [17]  The speech of labor disputants, of course, is subject to a number of restrictions.  The Court stated in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S., at 618 , for example, that an employer's threats of retaliation for the labor actions of his employees are "without the protection of the First Amendment." The constitutionality of restrictions upon speech in the special context of labor disputes is not before us here.  We express no views on that complex subject, and advert to cases in the labor field only to note that in some circumstances speech of an entirely private and economic character enjoys the protection of the First Amendment.

 They may also make inapplicable the prohibition against prior restraints.  Compare New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971), with Donaldson v. Read Magazine, 333 U. S. 178, 189-191 (1948); FTC v. Standard Education Society, 302 U. S. 112 (1937); E. F. Drew & Co. v. FTC, 235 F. 2d 735, 739-740 (CA2 1956), cert. denied, 352 U. S. 969 (1957).  [25]  We stress that we have considered in this case the regulation of commercial advertising by pharmacists.  Although we express no opinion as to other professions, the distinctions, historical and functional, between professions, may require consideration of quite different factors.  Physicians and lawyers, for example, do not dispense standardized products; they render professional services of almost infinite variety and nature, with the consequent enhanced possibility for confusion and deception if they were to undertake certain kinds of advertising.  [1]  In recent years the soundness of the sweeping language of the Chrestensen opinion has been repeatedly questioned.  See Bigelow v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 809, 819-821</citedDecision> ; Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 314-315 , and n. 6 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S. 376, 398 (Douglas, J., dissenting); id., at 401 , and n. 6 (STEWART, J., dissenting); Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (Douglas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  [2] Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 .  See, e. g., Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U. S. 507, 520 ; Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 209 ; Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 828 ; Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 115 .  [3]  Speech by an employer or a labor union organizer that contains material misrepresentations of fact or appeals to racial prejudice may form the basis of an unfair labor practice or warrant the invalidation of a certification election.  See, e. g., Sewell Mfg. Co., 138 N. L. R. B. 66; United States Gypsum Co., 130 N. L. R. B. 901; Gummed Products Co., 112 N. L. R. B. 1092.  Such restrictions would clearly violate First Amendment guarantees if applied to political expression concerning the election of candidates to public office.  See Vanasco v. Schwartz, 401 F. Supp. 87 (EDNY) (three-judge court), summarily aff'd sub nom. Schwartz v. Postel, 423 U. S. 1041 .
