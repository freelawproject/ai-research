 .  .  between mail-order sellers with [a physical presence in the taxing] State and those ... who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business.” We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval ever since.  For example, in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 263 (1989), we expressed “doubt that termination of an interstate telephone call, by itself, provides a substantial enough nexus for a State to tax a call. See National Bellas Hess .  .  .  (receipt of mail provides insufficient nexus).” See also D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, <citedDecision>486 U. S. 24, 33</citedDecision> (1988); Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S., at 437 ; National Geographic Society, 430 U. S., at 559 .  For these reasons, we disagree with the State Supreme Court’s conclu *312 sion that our decision in Complete Auto undercut the Bellas Hess rule.  The State of North Dakota relies less on Complete Auto and more on the evolution of our due process jurisprudence.  The State contends that the nexus requirements imposed by the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are equivalent and that if, as we concluded above, a mail-order house that lacks a physical presence in the taxing State nonetheless satisfies the due process “minimum contacts” test, then that corporation also meets the Commerce Clause “substantial nexus” test.  We disagree.  Despite the similarity in phrasing, the nexus requirements of the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are not identical.  The two standards are animated by different constitutional concerns and policies.

 As we shall explain, Quill’s interests in the licensed software does not affect our analysis of the due process issue and does not comprise the “substantial nexus” required by the Commerce Clause.  See n. 8, infra.  The court also suggested that, in view of the fact that the “touchstone of Due Process is fundamental fairness” and that the “very object” of the Commerce Clause is protection of interstate business against discriminatory local practices, it would be ironic to exempt Quill from this burden and thereby allow it to enjoy a significant competitive advantage over local retailers.  470 N. W. 2d, at 214-215 .  Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, 306 U. S. 62 (1939).  Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 312 U. S. 369 (1941).  Under our current Commerce Clause jurisprudence, “with certain restrictions, interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes.” D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, <citedDecision>486 U. S. 24, 31</citedDecision> (1988); see also Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 623-624 (1981) (“It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of [the] state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  North Dakota’s use tax illustrates well how a state tax might unduly burden interstate commerce.  On its face, North Dakota law imposes a collection duty on every vendor who advertises in the State three times in a single year.  Thus, absent the Bellas Hess rule, a publisher who included a subscription card in three issues of its magazine, a vendor whose radio advertisements were heard in North Dakota on three occasions, and a corporation whose telephone sales force made three calls into the State, all would be subject to the collection duty.  What is more significant, similar obligations might be imposed by the Nation’s 6,000-plus taxing jurisdictions.  See National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., 386 U. S. 753, 769-760 (1967) (noting that the “many variations in rates of tax, in allowable exemptions, and in administrative and record-keeping requirements could entangle [a mail-order house] in a virtual welter of complicated obligations”) (footnotes omitted); see also Shaviro, An Economic and Political Look at Federalism in Taxation, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 895 , 925-926 (1992).  We have sometimes stated that the “Complete Auto test, while responsive to Commerce Clause dictates, encompasses as well .

 .  where reliance interests are involved.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991).  As the Court notes, “the Bellas Hess rule has engendered substantial reliance and has become part of the basic framework of a sizable industry.” Ante, at 317.  I do not share Justice White’s view that we may disregard these reliance interests because it has become unreasonable to rely upon Bellas Hess.  Post, at 331-332.  Even assuming for the sake of argument (I do not consider the point) that later decisions in related areas are inconsistent with the principles upon which Bellas Hess rested, we have never acknowledged that, but have instead carefully distinguished the case on its facts.  See, e. g., D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, <citedDecision>486 U. S. 24, 33</citedDecision> (1988); National Geographic Society, supra, at 559.  It seems to me important that we retain our ability — and, what comes to the same thing, that *321 we maintain public confidence in our ability — sometimes to adopt new principles for the resolution of new issues without abandoning clear holdings of the past that those principles contradict.  We seemed to be doing that in this area.  Having affirmatively suggested that the “physical presence” rule could be reconciled with our new jurisprudence, we ought not visit economic hardship upon those who took us at our word.  We have recently told lower courts that “[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, [they] should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.” Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).  It is strangely incompatible with this to demand that private parties anticipate our overrulings.  It is my view, in short, that reliance upon a square, unabandoned holding of the Supreme Court is always justifiable reliance (though reliance alone may not always carry the day).
**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 Since we specifically limited the question on which certiorari was granted in order not to consider the potential retroactive effects of overruling Bellas Hess, I believe we should leave that issue for another day. If indeed fears about retroactivity are driving the Court’s decision in this case, we would be better served, in my view, to address *333 those concerns directly rather than permit them to infect our formulation of the applicable substantive rule.  Although Congress can and should address itself to this area of law, we should not adhere to a decision, however right it was at the time, that by reason of later cases and economic reality can no longer be rationally justified.  The Commerce Clause aspect of Bellas Hess, along with its due process holding, should be overruled.  See, e. g., P. Hartman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxation § 10.8 (1981); Hartman, Collection of Use Tax on Out-of-State Mail-Order Sales, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 993 , 1006-1015 (1986); Hellerstein, Significant Sales and Use Tax Developments During the Past Half Century, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 961 , 984-985 (1986); McCray, Overturning Bellas Hess: Due Process Considerations, 1985 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 265, 288-290; Rothfeld, Mail Order Sales and State Jurisdiction to Tax, 53 Tax Notes 1405 , 1414-1418 (1991).  Similarly, I am unconvinced by the majority’s reliance on subsequent decisions that have cited Bellas Hess.  See ante, at 311.  In D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, <citedDecision>486 U. S. 24, 33</citedDecision> (1988), for example, we distinguished Bellas Hess on the basis of the company’s “significant economic presence in Louisiana, its many connections with the State, and the direct benefits it receives from Louisiana in conducting its business.” We then went on to note that the situation presented was much more analogous to that in National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551 (1977).  See <citedDecision>486 U. S., at 33-34</citedDecision> .  In Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981), the Court cited Bellas Hess not to revalidate the physical-presence requirement, but rather to establish that a “nexus” must exist to justify imposition of a state tax. And finally, in *325 Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 437 (1980), the Court cited Bellas Hess for the due process requirements necessary to sustain a tax. In my view, these citations hardly signal the continuing support of Bellas Hess that the majority seems to find persuasive.  Instead of remanding for consideration of whether Quill’s ownership of software constitutes sufficient physical presence under its new Commerce Clause nexus requirement, the majority concludes as a matter of law that it does not.  See ante, at 315, n. 8.  In so doing, the majority rebuffs North Dakota’s challenge without setting out any clear standard for what meets the Commerce Clause physical-presence nexus standard and without affording the State an opportunity on remand to attempt to develop facts or otherwise to argue that Quill’s presence is constitutionally sufficient.  For the federal rule, see Flora v. United States, 357 U. S. 63 (1958); see generally J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation § 58A.05 (1992).  North Dakota appears to follow the same principle.
