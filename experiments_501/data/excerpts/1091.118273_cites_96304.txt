 See Treaty with the Chippewa of Sault Ste. Marie, Art, 1, 11 Stat. 631 (“The said Chippewa Indians surrender to the United States the right of fishing at the falls of St. Mary’s *196 ... secured to them by the treaty of June 16, 1820”).  6 See, e. g., Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397 U. S. 620, 631 (1970) (rejecting argument that language in Treaty had special meaning when United States was competent to state that meaning more clearly).  The State argues that any 1837 Treaty rights, or to usufructuary rights more generally, the second sentence of Article 1 nevertheless abrogates those rights.  But to determine whether this language abrogates Chippewa Treaty rights, we look beyond the written words to the larger context that frames the Treaty, including “the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties.” Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U. S. 423, 432 (1943); see also El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S. 155, 167 (1999).  In this case, an examination of the historical record provides insight into how the parties to the Treaty understood the terms of the agreement.  This insight is especially helpful to the extent that it sheds light on how the Chippewa signatories to the Treaty understood the agreement because we interpret Indian treaties to give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood them.  See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 675-676 (1979); United States v. Winans, <citedDecision>198 U. S. 371, 380-381</citedDecision> (1905).  The 1855 was pewa land to the United States, not to terminate Chippewa usufructuary rights.  It was negotiated under the authority of the Act of December 19,1854.  This Act authorized treaty *197 negotiations with the Chippewa “for the extinguishment of their title to all the lands owned and claimed by them in the Territory of Minnesota and State of Wisconsin.” Ch. 7, 10 Stat. 598 .  The Act is silent with respect to authorizing agreements to terminate Indian usufructuary privileges, and this silence was likely not accidental.  During Senate debate on the Act, Senator Sebastian, the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, stated that the treaties to be negotiated under the Act would “reserv[e] to them [i e., the Chippewa] those rights which are secured by former treaties.” Cong. Globe, 33d Cong., 1st Sess., 1404 (1854).  summoned several Chippewa chiefs to Washington, D. C., to begin negotiations over the sale of Chippewa land in Minnesota to the United States.

 Thus, those rights could not survive Wyoming’s admission to the Union on “equal footing” with the original States.  But Race Horse rested on a subsequent eases have made clear, an Indian tribe’s treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on state land are not irreconcilable with a State’s sovereignty over the natural resources in the State.  See, e.g., Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., supra; see also Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194 (1975).  Rather, Indian treaty rights can coexist with state management of natural resources.  Although States have important interests in regulating wildlife and natural resources within their borders, this authority is shared with the Federal Government when the Federal Government exercises one of its enumerated constitutional powers, such as treaty making.  U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  See, e. g., Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920); Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529 (1976); United States v. Winans, <citedDecision>198 U. S., at 382-384</citedDecision> ; United States v. Forty-three Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U. S. 188 (1876).  See also Menominee Tribe v. United States, supra, at 411, n. 12.  Here, the 1837 Treaty gave the Chippewa the right to hunt, fish, and gather in the ceded territory free of territorial, and later state, regulation, a privilege that others did not enjoy.  Today, this freedom from state regulation curtails the State’s ability to regulate hunting, fishing, and gathering by the Chippewa in the ceded lands.  But this Court’s cases have also recognized that Indian treaty-based usufructuary rights do not guarantee the Indians “absolute freedom” from state regulation.  Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath *205 Tribe, 473 U. S., at 765, n. 16 .  We have repeatedly reaffirmed state authority to impose reasonable and necessary nondiscriminatory regulations on Indian hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in the interest of conservation.

 Post, at 219.  Although we cited Race Horse in Klamath, we did not in so doing reaffirm the equal footing doctrine as a bar to the continuation of Indian treaty-based usufructuary rights.  Klamath did not involve the equal footing doctrine.  Rather, we cited Race Horse for the second part of its holding, discussed in the text, infra, at 206-208.  See 473 U. S., at 773, n. 23 .  In any event, the Race Horse Gourt’s reliance on the equal footing doctrine to terminate Indian treaty rights rested on foundations that were rejected by this Court within nine years of that decision.  See United States v. Winans, <citedDecision>198 U. S. 371, 382-384</citedDecision> (1905).

 But it is doubtful that the so-called “conservation necessity5’ standard applies in eases, such as this one, where Indians reserved no more than a 'privilege to hunt, fish, and gather.  The conservation necessity standard appears to have its origin in Tulee v. Washington, 315 U. S. 681 (1942).  In the 1859 Treaty with the Yakima Indians, the Yakima reserved “The right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory.’ ” Id., at 683 (quoting 12 Stat. 953 ).  The Court held that Washington State had the “power to impose on Indians, equally with others, such restrictions of a purely regulatory nature concerning the time and manner of fishing outside the reservation as are necessary for the conservation offish,” but that the Treaty foreclosed “the state from charging the Indians a fee of the kind in question.” 315 U. S., at 684 (emphasis added).  Its conclusion was driven by the language of the Treaty as well as the report of the treaty negotiations and what it revealed to be the Yakimas’ understanding of the Treaty — to preserve their right “to hunt and fish in accordance with the immemorial customs of their tribes.” Ibid, (emphasis added).  1 Subsequent decisions evaluating state regulation by the conservation necessity standard similarly focused upon the language of the Treaty or agreement at issue and the Indians’ understanding of the Treaty as revealed by the historical evidence.  See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 665-669, 674-685 (1979) (recognizing that the Court had construed the same Treaty language several times before, and emphasizing *224 the historical background against which the Treaty at issue was signed); Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 891 U. S. 392 , 395, 397 (1968) (involving treaty language almost identical to that at issue in United States v. Winans, <citedDecision>198 U. S. 371</citedDecision> (1905), and Tulee, supra); see also Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194, 206 (1975) (favorably comparing the somewhat different language of the agreement at issue with the language of the Treaties at issue in Winans and Puyallup).  Most important, all the cases that the majority cites in support of the proposition that States may enforce against Indians in their exercise of off-reservation usufructuary activities only those regulations necessary for purposes of conservation, ante, at 204-205, involved the same or substantially similar treaty language reserving a right to hunt or fish. And all but Antoine also provided that the Indians could exercise their reserved rights at the usual and accustomed places.  In New York ex rel. Kennedy v. (1916), the Court considered significantly different language.  The Big Tree Treaty of 1797, as the agreement was known, provided that the Seneca were to retain “the privilege of fishing and hunting on the said tract of land” conveyed by the agreement.  7 Stat. 602 (emphasis added); see also 241 U. S., at 562 (quoting the reservation clause).  The Court characterized the Senecas’ claim as one “sought to be maintained in derogation of the sovereignty of the State.” Ibid. In rejecting such a claim, it stated: “[I]t can hardly be supposed that the thought of the Indians was concerned with the necessary exercise of inherent power under modern conditions for the preservation of wild life. But the existence of the sovereignty of the State was well understood, and this conception involved all that was necessarily implied in that sovereignty, whether fully appreciated or not.  We do not think that it is a proper construction of the reservation in the conveyance to regard it as an attempt either to *225 reserve sovereign prerogative or so to divide the inherent power of preservation as to make its competent exercise impossible.

 2 *226 The 1837 Treaty at issue here did not reserve "the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory” like those involved in Tulee and Puyallup Tribe .  Rather, it provided: “The privilege of hunting, wild rice, upon the lands, the rivers and the lakes included in the territory ceded, is guarantied to the Indians, during the pleasure of the President of the United States.” 1887 Treaty with the Chippewa, 7 Stat. 537 (emphasis added).  This language more closely resembles the language of the Big Tree Treaty at issue in Kennedy.  Although Minnesota’s regulatory authority is not at issue here, in the appropriate ease we must explain whether reserved treaty privileges limit States’ ability to regulate Indians’ off-reservation usu-fructuary activities in the same way as a treaty reserving rights.  3 This is especially true with respect to the privileges reserved by the Chippewa in the 1837 Treaty, which, as The CHIEF Justice explains, ante, at 219-220 (dissenting opinion), were clearly of a temporary and precarious nature.

United States v. Winans, <citedDecision>198 U. S. 371, 381-382</citedDecision> (1905).

A possible explanation is *226 that the Treaties at issue in Puyallup Tribe and Tulee provided express federal law to the contrary, while the Treaty in Kennedy did not.
