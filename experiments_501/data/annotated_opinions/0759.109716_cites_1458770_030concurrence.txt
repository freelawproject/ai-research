 indistinguishable from the location restriction in the present case,” because “[i]n both cases the restrictions limited the freedom of the retailer to dispose of the purchased products as he desired.” Ante, at 46.  The customer restriction may well have, however, a very different “intent and competitive impact” than the location restriction: It prevents discount stores from getting the manufacturer’s product and thus prevents intrabrand price competition.  Suppose, for example, that in-terbrand competition is sufficiently weak that the franchised retailers are able to charge a price substantially above wholesale.  Under a location restriction, these franchisers are free to sell to discount stores seeking to exploit the potential for sales at prices below the prevailing retail level.  One of the franchised retailers may be tempted to lower its price and act in effect as a wholesaler for the discount house in order to share in the profits to be had from lowering prices and expanding volume.  1 *61 Under a retail customer restriction, on the other hand, the franchised dealers cannot sell to discounters, who are cut off altogether from the manufacturer’s product and the opportunity for intrabrand price competition.  This was precisely the theory on which the Government successfully challenged Schwinn’s customer restrictions in this Court. The District Court in that case found that “[e]ach one of [Schwinn’s franchised retailers] knows also that he is not a wholesaler and that he cannot sell as a wholesaler or act as an agent for some other unfranchised dealer, such as a discount house retailer who has not been franchised as a dealer by Schwinn.” <citedDecision>237 F. Supp. 323, 333</citedDecision> (ND Ill. 1965).  The Government argued on appeal, with extensive citations to the record; that the effect of this restriction was “to keep Schwinn products out of the hands of discount houses and other price cutters so as to discourage price competition in retailing .  .  .  .” Brief for United States, O. T. 1966, No. 25, p. 26.  See id., at 29-37.  2 It is true that, as the majority states, Sylvania’s location restriction inhibited to some degree “the freedom of the retailer to dispose of the purchased products” by requiring the retailer to sell from one particular place of business.

 .  .”).  Just as there are significant differences between Schwinn and this case with respect to intrabrand competition, there are also significant differences with respect to interbrand competition.  Unlike Schwinn, Sylvania clearly had no economic power in the generic product market.  At the time they instituted their respective distribution policies, Schwinn was “the leading bicycle producer in the Nation,” with a national market share of 22.5%, 388 U. S., at 368, 374 , whereas Syl-vania was a “faltering, if not failing” producer of television sets, with “a relatively insignificant 1% to 2%” share of the national market in which the dominant manufacturer had a 60% to 70% share.  Ante, at 38, 58 n. 29.  Moreover, the Schwinn brand name enjoyed superior consumer acceptance and commanded a premium price as, in the District Court’s words, “the Cadillac of the bicycle industry.” <citedDecision>237 F. Supp., at 335</citedDecision> .  This premium gave Schwinn dealers a margin of *64 protection from interbrand competition and created the possibilities for price cutting by discounters that the Government argued were forestalled by Schwinn’s customer restrictions.  3 Thus, judged by the criteria economists use to measure market power — -product differentiation and market share 4 — Schwinn enjoyed a substantially stronger position in the bicycle market than did Sylvania in the television market.  This Court relied on Schwinn’s market position as one reason not to apply the rule of reason to the vertical restraints challenged there.  “Schwinn was not a newcomer, seeking to break into or stay in the bicycle business.  It was not a 'failing company.’ On the contrary, at the initiation of these practices, it was the leading bicycle producer in the Nation.” 388 U. S., at 374 .  And the Court of Appeals below found “another significant distinction between our case and Schwinn” in Syl-vania’s “precarious market share,” which “was so small when it adopted its locations practice that it was threatened with expulsion from the television market.” 537 F. 2d, at 991 .
