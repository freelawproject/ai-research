      <p class="indent">This class suit was brought to challenge actions of Illinois and Cook County officials in administering the federal-state program of Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled ("AABD") under 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1381-1385.  Count I of the amended complaint alleged that defendants, acting pursuant to Section 4004.1 of the Categorical Assistance Manual of the Illinois Department of Public Aid,<a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">2</a> were not complying with federal regulations requiring that eligibility determinations on applications for assistance for the aged and blind under AABD be made within 30 days and for the disabled within 60 days (formerly 45 days) and requiring that those found eligible receive their assistance within the respective maximum time periods.<a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref">3</a>  Plaintiffs further charged that defendants improperly authorized grants to commence only with the month in which an application was approved and not including prior eligibility months for which an applicant was entitled to aid under federal law.<a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref">4</a>  Count II alleged that the Fourteenth Amendment, the applicable federal and Illinois statutes, and the federal regulations require that AABD applicants who meet the eligibility conditions on the date of application must receive assistance effective from that date.</p>

      <p class="indent">The district court declared Section 4004 (and subsections thereunder) of the Illinois Categorical Assistance Manual invalid insofar as it was at variance with 45 C.F.R. Sec. 206.10(3) and granted a permanent injunction requiring compliance with the federal time limits for processing and paying AABD applicants, except in certain exemplified unusual circumstances, and retroactively requiring defendants to release AABD benefits withheld from those whose applications, commencing on July 1, 1968, to April 16, 1971,<a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref">5</a> had not been processed within the federal time limits.  A stay pending appeal was granted as to the latter requirement.  The court also held that eligible AABD applicants are not entitled to assistance from the date of application and denied plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages against a former Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid.  Defendants appeal from the district court's decision on the grounds that plaintiff's suit for retroactive welfare benefits may not be maintained in federal court because barred by the Eleventh Amendment, that the judgment of inconsistency between the federal regulations and the provisions of the Illinois Categorical Assistance Manual can be given prospective effect only, and that the federal regulations in question are inconsistent with the Social Security Act.  Plaintiffs appeal from that decision insofar as it held them not entitled to receive benefits from the date of their applications and insofar as it failed to award the requested punitive damages.</p>

    <p>Eleventh Amendment Defense</p>
    <div class="num" id="p3">
      <span class="num">3</span>
      <p class="indent">Defendants' principal argument is that the Eleventh Amendment or the sovereign immunity doctrine bars an action against the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid for retroactive welfare AABD payments.  Significantly, defendants do not rely on the Eleventh Amendment or sovereign immunity with respect to the expenditure of state funds resulting from other portions of the judgment below.  We conclude the argument must fail.</p>

Here the district court's permanent injunction requiring compliance with the federal time limits for processing and paying AABD applicants reaches into the state treasury and requires the expenditure of more monies than the state was spending under the practices found unlawful.  In fact, that part of the judgment requires the expenditure of more monies than the seriously disputed part of the judgment requiring the payment of wrongfully withheld benefits!

      <p class="indent">It is said in Rothstein that Ex parte Young allows only "prospective" relief and it is apparently assumed that the date of the district court's decision is the crucial one for determining prospectivity. <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">467</span> <span class="reporter">F.2d</span> <span class="page">236-237</span></span>.  (See note 11, infra.)  In Ex parte Young the Minnesota legislature had set allegedly confiscatory railroad rates, and in an effort to make a test of the legality of the rates impracticable made issuance of any ticket above the rate a crime punishable by an enormous fine or lengthy imprisonment or both.  This scheme was alleged to violate equal protection and due process.  On the eve of the effective date of the legislation, petitioners applied for and received a federal court injunction against the state Attorney General forbidding him to enforce the statute.  The Supreme Court held the district court could properly grant the early injunction applied for, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment, upon finding the enactment unconstitutional.  To be sure, in the posture of Ex parte Young, in the district court, the injunction prayed for was completely adequate equitable relief.  The validity of that injunction, which the State Attorney General disobeyed, was the issue before the Supreme Court.  There is nothing in Ex parte Young which delimits the relief a district court can give notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment in a case which comes before it in a different posture.  In fact, it appears that the Court in Ex parte Young was well aware that permissible relief might take a form other than a prospective injunction, for it phrased the question before it generally as "whether there is a remedy that the parties interested may resort to, by going into a Federal court of equity, in a case involving a violation of the Federal Constitution * * <span class="citation" data-id="96819"><span class="antecedent_guess">*."</span>  <a href="/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/"><span class="volume">209</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> at <span class="page">149</span></a></span>, 28 S.Ct. at 449.

The price would be paid by the beneficiaries of a federal program in which the state, not incidentally, agreed to participate and whose regulations it therefore agreed to abide by. 42 U.S.C.

An eligible beneficiary who brought suit contemporaneously with the initiation of the welfare officials' illegal practices and eo instante secured an injunction could obtain all the benefits he was entitled to, but he would forfeit part of those benefits to the unjust enrichment of the state because he did not instantly file a complaint or because federal judicial machinery consumes time.<a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref">11</a></p>

Plaintiffs here did not seek relief for consequential damages caused by defendant's failure to disburse their full statutory entitlement.<a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref">13</a>  Rather, incident to the injunctive relief prayed for, they asked that exactly measured benefits retained by defendants which would have been paid out but for a violation of federal law be paid over to them.  Since the State of Illinois obligated itself to follow federal law in disbursing welfare assistance, it cannot cogently complain that having to make those payments now, which federal law required it to make in the first place, will wreak fiscal disruption.  In accepting the federal assistance program, the state must have calculated the cost of compliance.  To the extent a decree of retroactive payments would actually disturb the state's finances and cause other programs to suffer, as a matter of equitable balancing of interests, it might well be inappropriate relief.<a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref">14</a>  But that possibility is insufficient to preclude the ability of a federal court to order restitution.</p>

Sec. 1331 et seq.).

Thus Louisiana's one-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions rather than the equitable doctrine of laches would be the applicable law, but the Supreme Court declined to apply the Rodrigue decision retroactively to time-bar plaintiff's suit.  In so doing the Court generally adopted a three-pronged test for determining the retroactivity question.  The first prong is that "the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied * * * or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed * * <span class="citation" data-id="108406"><span class="antecedent_guess">*."</span>  <a href="/opinion/108406/chevron-oil-co-v-huson/"><span class="volume">404</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> at <span class="page">106</span></a></span>, 92 S.Ct. at 355 (emphasis supplied).

      <p class="indent">Here defendants cannot satisfy the first test.  No new principle of substantive law was enunciated by the district judge.  The federal time requirements for processing applications and paying eligible AABD applicants were made effective July 1, 1968, and defendants were well aware of these mandatory maximum permissible time standards.  The district court merely found defendants to be noncompliant from and after the effective date of the regulations.  Insofar as the defendants might suggest that the relief awarded-payment of wrongfully withheld benefits-was a new principle of law, it should suffice to say that defendants have not shown any reliance on the absence of such a remedy, much less a legitimate reliance interest worthy of protection.</p>

      <p class="indent">Plaintiffs contend that AABD benefits must be paid effective from the date that an individual applies for aid if he is subsequently determined eligible and meets all of the eligibility conditions at the time of his application.<a class="footnote" href="#fn19" id="fn19_ref">19</a>  Plaintiffs argue that this result is compelled by federal regulations, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Illinois Public Aid Code.  The district court rejected plaintiffs' arguments and held that defendants must make their determinations of eligibility and mail the first assistance check (or notice of denial of assistance) within 30 days from the date of application with respect to the aged and blind, and within 60 days of the date of application with respect to the disabled,<a class="footnote" href="#fn20" id="fn20_ref">20</a> but that assistance was not required to be retroactive to the date of application.</p>

    <div class="num" id="p34">

      <p class="indent">Plaintiffs rely on certain general portions of the HEW's regulations providing that "a state plan * * * shall be in operation through a system of local offices on a statewide basis in accordance with equitable standards for assistance and administration * * *" (45 C.F.R. Sec. 205.120(a)); that "funds will be apportioned among the political subdivisions of the State on a basis consistent with equitable treatment of individuals in similar circumstances throughout the State" (45 C.F. R. Sec. 205.130(2)); that "the eligibility conditions imposed * * * must not result in inequitable treatment of individuals or groups * * *" (45 C.F. R. Sec. 233.10(a)(ii)); and that "the determination of need and amount of assistance for all applicants will be made on an objective and equitable basis * * *" (45 C.F.R. Sec. 233.20(a)(1)).  None of these general provisions compels the conclusion that "equitable treatment" is synonymous with assistance paid retroactively to the date of application for those subsequently determined eligible.  On the contrary, 45 C.F.R. Sec. 206.10(a)(6) explicitly addresses the effective date of assistance and provides: "Entitlement will begin as specified in the State plan, which (i) for financial assistance must be no later than the date of authorization of payment * * *" (emphasis supplied).<a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref">21</a>  And 45 C.F.R. Sec. 206.10(a)(3) provides that the decision to authorize must be made within the applicable 30- or 60-day limitation period.  Thus insofar as the general provisions for equitable treatment apply, the pointed provisions of 45 C.F.R. Sec. 206.10 (a)(6) and (3) set the parameters for equitable treatment in the specific situation as to when entitlement to financial assistance shall begin.  The result plaintiffs seek is therefore not prescribed by federal regulations.</p>

      <p class="indent">Plaintiffs' constitutional argument is that when entitlement to assistance attaches on the date the applicant is determined eligible, applicants will receive differing initial assistance amounts depending upon the speed of the administrative process.

      <p class="indent">With respect to the differentials in initial assistance grants due to variance in the speed of the administrative process, plaintiffs point to the gross disparities that formerly existed in paying AABD when the defendants were not complying (indeed were in egregious violation) of the federal maximum permissible time standards.  But under the judgment below, these gross disparities have been rectified.  All eligible aged and blind must now be paid within 30 days of their applications and all eligible disabled within 60 days therefrom.  We have no showing that significant disparities within the time limits will exist when defendants are processing all applications and paying all eligible beneficiaries within the 30- and 60-day time limits.  The slight disparities that are likely to occur within these limitations do not suffice to force the state to pay all applicants from the date of their applications.<a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref">22</a>  More precise mathematical niceties in the administrative process are not compelled by the Equal Protection Clause (cf.

      <p class="indent">Finally, plaintiffs contend that the Illinois Public Aid Code, Ill.Rev.Stat.1971, ch. 23, Sec. 3-1, requires that benefits be paid retroactive to the date of application.  That statute provides:</p>

    <p>Award of Punitive Damages</p>
    <div class="num" id="p41">
      <span class="num">41</span>
      <p class="indent">Plaintiffs sought $100,000 punitive damages from defendant Harold O. Swank, former Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid.  In refusing to grant such damages, the district court held that the permanent injunction was a sufficient deterrent to future violations.  As in Westberry v. Fisher, <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">309</span> <span class="reporter">F. Supp.</span> <span class="page">12</span></span>, 17 (D.Me.1970), the record is utterly devoid of any proof of abuse of discretionary authority, malice, or ill-will on the part of defendant Swank.  In our view, the district judge did not abuse his discretion in denying punitive damages.  See Francis v. Davidson, <span class="citation" data-id="1445651"><a href="/opinion/1445651/francis-v-davidson/"><span class="volume">340</span> <span class="reporter">F. Supp.</span> <span class="page">351</span></a></span>, 369-370 (D. Md.1972).  It is true that the district court granted plaintiff's motion for an order that facts be taken as established, which included statements that Swank knew that eligible AABD applicants were not treated consistently and were not paid within the federal time limitations.  Nevertheless, absent any further proof, as the district judge obviously recognized, the granting of that motion does not warrant such a harsh remedy.</p>

        <p>At all times pertinent to this case, Section 8255.1 of the Categorical Assistance Manual of the Illinois Department of Public Aid provided that a new assistance grant may be authorized for the month in which the application was approved but not (with certain exceptions) for any prior period.  Thus where eligibility was determined subsequent to the 30-day and 60-day time periods mandated by federal regulations, an applicant might not receive assistance retroactive to the 30th or 60th day. Such was the case of the named plaintiff who applied for disability assistance on September 18, 1970, but who received aid starting only with the month of January since that was the month in which his application was approved.  See Rodriguez v. Swank, <span class="citation" data-id="1481015"><a href="/opinion/1481015/rodriguez-v-swank/"><span class="volume">318</span> <span class="reporter">F.

A new Illinois Department of Public Aid regulation, Section 8111 of the Categorical Assistance Manual, provides that when a determination of eligibility is not made within the 30-day or 60-day periods "assistance is to be retroactive to the 30th or 60th day from the date of application, providing the applicant was eligible for that period."  However, whereas Section 8255.1 made assistance effective from the first of the month in which eligibility was determined, Section 8111 provides "[T]he period for which needs may be met by initial authorization begins with the date of decision and authorization action by the caseworker."  Hence in a case in which the caseworker acts within the appropriate deadline, Section 8111 may defer the effective date of initial assistance beyond what Section 8255.1 would have provided.  But see 45 C.F.R. Sec. 206.10(6).</p>

See Davis, Suing the Government by Falsely Pretending to Sue an Officer, 29 U.Chi.L.Rev. 435, 437 (1968).  Of course, there is nothing inherent in this fiction which precludes its utilization to allow equitable relief other than an injunction against future conduct.  The state official can be said to be "stripped of his official or representative character" when ordered to pay out benefits he withheld in violation of federal law</p>

        <p> There is no suggestion here that the plaintiffs have been dilatory in filing suit.  However, this consideration goes to plaintiffs' equitable entitlement to the amounts requested, not to the court's power to grant relief</p>
        <p>How far back the retroactive award should reach will depend on the circumstances of each case.  Here, the federal regulations were promulgated well in advance of their July 1, 1968, effective date and defendants knew that compliance was required as of that date.</p>

        <p> In addressing the issue of Utah's consent to federal court suit, Justice Reed may have stated the true ratio decidendi of the immunity question in the three cases:</p>
        <p>"Those cases declare the rule that clear declaration of a state's consent to suit against itself in the federal court on fiscal claims is required.  The reason underlying the rule, which is discussed at length in the Read and Ford cases, is the right of a state to reserve for its courts the primary consideration and decision of its own tax litigation because of the direct impact of such litigation upon its finances."

        <p> In determining whether to order the retroactive payment of benefits, district courts are exercising their equity powers and hence must engage in a balancing process.  They should give consideration to the factors to be weighed in the balance identified by the Second Circuit in Rothstein v. Wyman, <span class="citation" data-id="305771"><a href="/opinion/305771/edna-rothstein-v-george-k-wyman-as-commissioner-of-the-department-of/"><span class="volume">467</span> <span class="reporter">F.2d</span> <span class="page">226</span></a></span>, 232-236 (2d Cir. 1972)</p>
        <p>In this case, the defendants did not pointedly bring out below countervailing considerations that might make the district court's relief an improper exercise of equitable discretion.  Notably, in appealing the award of retroactive payments in Rodriguez v. Swank, <span class="citation" data-id="1481015"><a href="/opinion/1481015/rodriguez-v-swank/"><span class="volume">318</span> <span class="reporter">F. Supp.</span> <span class="page">289</span> </a></span>(N.D.Ill.1970) (order Oct. 29, 1970), affirmed, <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">403</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">901</span></span>, <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">91</span> <span class="reporter">S. Ct.</span> <span class="page">2202</span></span>, <span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">29</span> <span class="reporter">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class="page">677</span></span>, the defendants argued unsuccessfully to the Supreme Court that in ordering retroactive payments (in that case by agreement to the date the lawsuit was filed), the district court clearly abused its discretion.  (Jurisdictional Statement at 12.)  That case involved defendants' violation of the same federal time regulations as in this case, but with respect to AFDC applicants.  Furthermore, the district court here found that defendants "knew that substantial numbers of eligible AABD applicants were being deprived, contrary to the requirements of federal law, of their full AABD entitlements effective thirty days from the date of their application * * *."  Since defendants did not thoroughly argue the equities below and do not really press the point here, we will not review the appropriateness of the award of retroactive relief.  However, we note that in addition to the deterrent policies that might possibly be served by such an award on the facts of this case, this is not a case involving irretrievably misspent funds but one involving funds which were wrongfully not spent at all.

        <p> Assuming arguendo that any differentials due to the speed of the administrative process were unjustified, still no requirement that all applicants be paid retroactively to the date of their applications would be constitutionally necessary since defendants could presumably pass constitutional muster with an administrative procedure that dealt exactly uniformly with all applicants, though not paying them from the date of their applications, even though it resulted in less welfare spending and in some receiving initial payments in lesser amounts than under the present administrative scheme</p>

        <p> Although defendants have not advanced the argument, neither have plaintiffs drawn our attention to any requirement that defendants assume a possibly greater administrative burden of determining eligibility retrospectively as of date of application.  It may be that in most cases a determination of eligibility will mean that the applicant was eligible on the date he applied, but plaintiffs imply that the two may not be coincident</p>
