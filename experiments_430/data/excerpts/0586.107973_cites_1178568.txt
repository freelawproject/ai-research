 The question that remains unsettled in this case, after eight years of litigation in the California courts, is whether Adkins will receive compensation for Lear’s use of those improvements which the inventor has subsequently patented.  At every stage of this lawsuit, Lear has sought to prove that, despite the grant of a patent *656 by the Patent Office, none of Adkins’ improvements were sufficiently novel to warrant the award of a monopoly under the standards delineated in the governing federal statutes.  Moreover, the company has sought to prove that Adkins obtained his patent by means of a fraud on the Patent Office.  In response, the inventor has argued that since Lear had entered into a licensing agreement with Adkins, it was obliged to pay the agreed royalties regardless of the validity of the underlying patent.  The Supreme Court of California unanimously vindicated the inventor’s position.  While the court recognized that generally a manufacturer is free to challenge the validity of an inventor’s patent, it held that “one of the oldest doctrines in the field of patent law establishes that so long as a licensee is operating under a license agreement he is estopped to deny the validity of his licensor’s patent in a suit for royalties under the agreement.  The theory underlying this doctrine is that a licensee should not be permitted to enjoy the benefit afforded by the agreement while simultaneously urging that the patent which forms the basis of the agreement is void.” <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d 882, 891</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d 321, 325-326</citedDecision> (1967).  Almost 20 years ago, in its last consideration of the doctrine, this Court also invoked an estoppel to deny a licensee the right to prove that his licensor was demanding royalties for the use of an idea which was in reality a part of the public domain.  Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 339 U. S. 827, 836 (1950).  We granted certiorari in the present case, 391 U. S. 912 , to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule in the light of our recent decisions emphasizing the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection.

 52 Cal. Rptr. 795 , 806.  So far as pre-1959 royalties were concerned, the court held that the contract required the company to pay royalties on both the California and Michigan gyros regardless of the validity of the inventor’s patent.  52 Cal. Rptr., at 809.  Once again both sides appealed, this time to the California Supreme Court, which took yet another approach to the problem presented.  The court rejected the District Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the 1955 license gave Lear the right to terminate its royalty obligations in 1959.  Since the 1955 agreement was still in effect, the court concluded, relying on the language we have already quoted, that the doctrine of estoppel barred Lear from questioning the propriety of the Patent Office’s grant.  <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 907</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 336</citedDecision> .  The court’s adherence to estoppel, however, was not without qualification.  After noting Lear’s claim that it had developed its Michigan gyros independently, the court tested this contention by considering “whether what is being built by Lear [in Michigan] springs entirely” (emphasis supplied) from the prior art. <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 913</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 340</citedDecision> .  Applying this test, it found that Lear had in fact “utilized the apparatus patented by Adkins throughout the period in question,” <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 915</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 341</citedDecision> , and reinstated the jury’s $888,000 verdict on this branch of the case. II.  Since the California Supreme Court’s construction of the 1955 licensing agreement is solely a matter of state *662 law, the only issue open to us is raised by the court’s reliance upon the doctrine of estoppel to bar Lear from proving that Adkins’ ideas were dedicated to the common welfare by federal law. 10 In considering the propriety of the State Court’s decision, we are well aware that we are not writing upon a clean slate.  The doctrine of estoppel has been considered by this Court in a line of cases reaching back into the middle of the 19th century.  Before deciding what the role of estoppel *663 should be in the present case and in the future, it is, then, desirable to consider the role it has played in the past.  A. While the roots of the doctrine have often been celebrated in tradition, we have found only one 19th century case in this Court that invoked estoppel in a considered manner.  And that case was decided before the Sherman Act made it clear that the grant of monopoly power to a patent owner constituted a limited exception to the general federal policy favoring free competition.  Kinsman v. Parkhurst, 18 How. 289 (1856).
**Lead Opinion**
 The California Supreme Court did not address itself to this issue with precision, for it believed that the venerable doctrine of estoppel provided a sufficient answer to all of Lear’s claims based upon federal patent law. Thus, we do not know whether the Supreme Court would have awarded Adkins recovery even on his pre-patent royalties if it had recognized that previously established estoppel doctrine could no longer be properly invoked *675 with regard to royalties accruing during the 17-year patent period.  Our decision today will, of course, require the state courts to reconsider the theoretical basis of their decisions enforcing the contractual rights of inventors and it is impossible to predict the extent to which this re-evaluation may revolutionize the law of any particular State in this regard.  Consequently, we have concluded, after much consideration, that even though an important question of federal law underlies this phase of the controversy, we should not now attempt to define in even a limited way the extent, if any, to which the States may properly act to enforce the contractual rights of inventors of unpatented secret ideas.  Given the difficulty and importance of this task, it should be undertaken only after the state courts have, after fully focused inquiry, determined the extent to which they will respect the contractual rights of such inventors in the future.  Indeed, on remand, the California courts may well reconcile the competing demands of patent and contract law in a way which would not warrant further review in this Court. IV. We also find it inappropriate to pass at this time upon Lear’s contention that Adkins’ patent is invalid.  Not only did Lear fail to raise this issue in its petition for certiorari, but the California Supreme Court has yet to pass on the question of patent validity in that clear and unequivocal manner which is so necessary for proper adjudication in this Court. As we have indicated, the California Supreme Court considered the novelty of Adkins’ ideas relevant to its decision at only one stage of its extensive analysis.  Since Lear claimed that it had developed its Michigan gyros completely independently of Adkins’ efforts, the Supreme Court believed itself obliged to consider whether Adkins’ ideas were not “entirely” anticipated by the prior art. <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 913</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 340</citedDecision> .  Apply *676 ing this test, the court upheld the jury’s verdict of $888,000 on the Michigan gyros, finding that “Lear utilized the apparatus patented by Adkins throughout the period in question.” <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 915</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 341</citedDecision> .  In reaching this conclusion, however, the court did express its belief that Adkins’ invention made a “significant step forward” in the art of gyroscopy.  <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 915</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 341</citedDecision> .  It is far from clear that the court, in making this last statement, intended to hold that Adkins’ ideas satisfied the demanding standard of invention explicated in our decision in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U. S. 1 (1966).  Surely, such a holding was not required by the court’s analysis, which was concerned only with the question whether Lear had benefited from Adkins’ ideas in any degree.  In this context, we believe that Lear must be required to address its arguments attacking the validity of the underlying patent to the California courts in the first instance.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  Lear argues that this original agreement was not submitted in evidence at trial and so should not be considered a part of the record on appeal.  The California Supreme Court, however, treated the agreement as an important part of the record before it, <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 906</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 335</citedDecision> ; and so we are free to refer to it.  37 CFR §1.111 (1967).  37 CFR §1.106 (1967).  37 CFR §1.112 (1967).  37 CFR §1.113 (1967).

 While it is true that Lear did not ask the Supreme Court to repudiate estoppel entirely, it did seek to persuade the court to carve out an exception to the estoppel principle which was so sweeping as to undermine the doctrine’s vitality completely.  The company argued, on the basis of federal as well as state cases, that a licensee may escape the impact of estoppel simply by announcing that it has repudiated the licensing agreement, regardless of the contract’s terms.  See, e. g., Respondent’s and Cross-Appellant’s Opening Brief in Cases Nos. 28624 and 30089, at 110-111.  The California Supreme Court rejected this argument on its merits: “Lear relies on authorities holding that a licensee may terminate a license agreement upon notice to his licensor even though, prior to termination, there has been no adjudication of invalidity of the patent which is the subject of the agreement and that thereafter the licensee may challenge the validity of the patent.  (See, e. g., Armstrong Co. v. Shell Co. of Cal. (1929) 98 Cal. App. 769, 778-779 ).  This rule has no application if the agreement sets forth the particular circumstances under which termination must occur.  As stated above, such provisions must be complied with in order to /effect a valid cancellation.” <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 899</citedDecision> -900 n. 15, <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 331, n. 15</citedDecision> .  We clearly have jurisdiction to consider whether this decision is wrong.  In doing so, we have the duty to consider the broader implications of Lear’s contention, and vindicate, if appropriate, its claim to relief on somewhat different grounds than it chose to advance below, especially when the California court recognized, in language we have already quoted, supra, at 656, that matters of basic principle are at stake.  There are two other early cases which enforced patent licenses without a thorough consideration of the estoppel issues that were presented.  In Eureka Co. v. Bailey Co., 11 Wall. 488 (1871), the Court held that a licensee was obliged to overcome a “very strong presumption" of patent validity in order to avoid his royalty obligations, without indicating how much more compelling a showing was required than was considered necessary in an ordinary infringement action.  In Dale Tile Manufacturing Co. v. Hyatt, 125 U. S. 46 (1888), this Court affirmed the decision of the New York state courts invoking the doctrine of licensee estoppel, on the ground that the estoppel question presented was one which involved only state law. Edward Katzinger Co. v. Chicago Metallic Manufacturing Co., 329 U. S. 394 (1947); MacGregor v. Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co., 329 U. S. 402 (1947).  In addition to the works cited in the text, a detailed explication of the development of estoppel doctrine may be found in Cooper, Estoppel to Challenge Patent Validity: The Case of Private Good Faith vs. Public Policy, 18 W. Res. L. Rev. 1122 (1967), and in Kramer, Estoppel To Deny Validity — A Slender Reed, 23 N. Y. U. Intra.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice White, concurring in part. The applicable provision of 28 U. S. C. § 1257 empowers us to review by writ of certiorari “[fjinal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State ... where any title, right, privilege or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution, treaties or statutes of, or commission held or authority exercised under, the *678 United States.” Although Adkins disputes it, we have jurisdiction to consider whether a patent licensee is estopped to challenge the validity of the patent. The California Supreme Court ruled that he is and therefore would not entertain attacks on Adkins’ patent as a defense to his suit for royalties. Lear seeks review of that holding here. In my view, not only is the issue properly here but the Court has correctly decided it. Although we have jurisdiction to review this state court judgment and to determine the licensee estoppel issue, it does not necessarily follow that we may or should deal with two other federal questions which come into focus once the licensee is free to challenge the patent. The first is w'hether the patent is valid. The second, which arises only if the patent is invalidated, is whether federal law forbids the collection of royalties which might otherwise be collectible under a contract rooted in state law. Although the Court does not deal with the first issue, it does purport to decide the second, at least in part. However, as either a jurisdictional or a policy matter, neither of these issues is properly before us in this case. In the first place, we have no decision of the California Supreme Court affirming or denying, as a matter of federal law, that Adkins may not enforce his contract if his patent is held invalid. The California court held that the license agreement had not been terminated in accordance with its terms, that the doctrine of licensee estoppel prevented Lear from challenging the patent and that Lear was utilizing the teaching of Adkins’ patent. There was thus no necessity or reason to consider whether the patent was invalid, or, if it was, whether either state or federal law prevented collection of the royalties reserved by the contract. Even if these issues had been presented to the California Supreme Court, sound principles would have dictated that the court not render a *679 decision on questions unnecessary to its disposition of the case. See, e. g., Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Oklahoma, 303 U. S. 206, 212-213 (1938). There is no indication, however, that Lear, directly or by inference, urged in the California courts that if Adkins’ patent were invalid, federal law overrode state contract law and precluded collection of the royalties which Lear had promised to pay. One of the defenses presented by Lear in its answer to Adkins’ claim for royalties was that there had been a failure of consideration because of the absence of bargained-for patent-ability in Adkins’ ideas. But failure of consideration is a state law question, and I find nothing in the record and nothing in this Court’s opinion indicating that Lear at any time contended in the state courts that once Adkins’ patent was invalidated, the royalty agreement was unenforceable as a matter of federal law. 1 Given Lear’s failure below to “specially set up or claim” the federal bar to collection of royalties in the *680 event Adkins’ patent was invalidated, and without the California Supreme Court’s “final judgment” on this issue, I doubt our jurisdiction to decide the issue. But even if jurisdiction exists, the Court should follow its characteristic practice and refuse to issue pronouncements on questions not urged or decided in the state courts. In McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430 (1940), the Court, while recognizing it had jurisdiction to determine whether a New York tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, refused to consider whether the tax was a prohibited impost or duty on imports and exports, saying: “[I]t is only in exceptional cases, and then only in cases coming from the federal courts, that [the Court] considers questions urged by a petitioner or appellant not pressed or passed upon in the courts below. ... [D]ue regard for the appropriate relationship of this Court to state courts requires us to decline to consider and decide questions affecting the validity of state statutes not urged or considered there.” Id., at 434 . Wilson v. Cook, 327 U. S. 474 (1946), reached a similar conclusion. There the Court denied a government contractor the benefit of the implied constitutional immunity of the Federal Government from taxation by the State, but at the same time declined to consider whether the state tax at issue placed a forbidden tax directly on the United States. This was because the Court was “not free to consider” a ground of attack “not presented to the Supreme Court of Arkansas or considered or decided by it,” even though the issue was in some measure related to one actually decided by the state courts and arose under the same implied constitutional immunity argument. Id., at 483 . Cf. Dewey v. Des Moines, 173 U. S. 193, 197-198 (1899). The Court relied on Mc-Goldrick and a long line of prior cases, including New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, 300 U. S. 308, 317 (1937), *681 where the Court had said: “In reviewing the judgment of a state court, this Court will not pass upon any federal question not shown by the record to have been raised in the state court or considered there, whether it be one arising under a different or the same clause in the Constitution with respect to which other questions are properly presented.” The result is the same when a party has attempted to raise an issue in the state court but has not done so in proper or timely fashion. “Questions first presented to the highest State court on a petition for rehearing come too late for consideration here . . . .” Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, 326 U. S. 120, 128 (1945). “Since the State Supreme Court did not pass on the question now urged, and since it does not appear to have been properly presented to that court for decision, we are without jurisdiction to consider it in the first instance here.” CIO v. McAdory, 325 U. S. 472, 477 (1945). And no different conclusion obtains when the federal question, although not yet presented to or decided by the state court, will probably or even certainly arise during further proceedings held in that court. See, e. g., NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449, 466-467 (1958); Hudson Distributors, Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 377 U. S. 386, 394-395 (1964). Wholly aside from jurisdictional considerations or those relating to our relationships with state courts, there is the matter of our own Rule 23 (l)(c), which states that “[o'Jnly the questions set forth in the petition or fairly comprised therein will be considered by the court.” See Flournoy v. Wiener, 321 U. S. 253, 259 (1944). None of the questions presented by Lear’s petition for certiorari comes even close to the issue to which the Court now addresses itself — an issue which will arise only if Lear can and does challenge the patent, if the patent is declared invalid, if Adkins nevertheless seeks to enforce the agreement, and if Lear interposes a defense based on federal law. *682 This seems a poor case for waiving our Rules. In the first place, the question of validity has not been reached by the California Supreme Court, and when it is the patent may withstand attack. In that event there will be no necessity to consider the impact of patent law on the enforceability of a contract grounded in state law. Second, even if the patent is declared invalid, the state court, after the parties have addressed themselves to the issues, may accommodate federal and state law in a matter which would not prompt review here. Third, the parties themselves have neither briefed nor seriously argued the question in this Court, and we do not have the benefit of their views on what is surely a difficult question. The Court itself has flushed the issue, which it now deals with on a piecemeal basis. 2 Like the question of patent validity, I would leave the consequences of invalidity to the state court in the first instance. The Court brushes aside the problem by characterizing the additional issue it decides as representing a “more complicated estoppel problem.” But licensee estoppel, the question raised here, refers to estoppel against the licensee to challenge the patent, not to any bar or “estoppel” interposed by federal law against collecting royalties on an invalidated patent. Whether Adkins can enforce his contract for royalties if his patent is found to be invalid cannot be shoehorned into the licensee-estoppel question, and by no stretch of the imagination can it be included within the scope of the question raised and litigated by the parties in this case. In the courts below Lear wanted to challenge Adkins’ patent only for the purpose of showing that Adkins was entitled to no recovery under the terms of the contract itself, either because of a failure of consideration or because the contract had been legally terminated or could be legally terminated. Indeed, the District Court of Appeal noted: “Lear concedes that it would be estopped to contest the validity of any patent issued to Adkins on the claims of his application described in the license agreement so long as it continued to operate under that agreement.” 52 Cal. Rptr. 795 , 805. See also Lear’s Opening Brief in the District Court of Appeal 109. The Court’s opinion flatly proscribes recovery by Adkins of “all royalties accruing after Adkins’ 1960 patent issued if Lear can prove patent invalidity.” Ante, at 674. But recovery of pre-1960 royalties is left open by the Court, apparently because pre-issuance and post-issuance royalties do not stand on the same footing under federal law. Such a distinction may be valid, and pre-1960 royalties recoverable; but if so, what of post-1960 royalties which are attributable to the headstart Lear obtained over the rest of the industry as a result of pre-issuance disclosure of Adkins’ idea? Today’s bar to collection of post-1960 royalties would seem to be inflexible, and yet those royalties arguably are recoverable to the extent they represent payment for the pre-1960 disclosure of Adkins’ idea; to that extent, they seem indistinguishable from pre-1960 royalties, at least for purposes of federal patent law. Cf. Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U. S. 29, 31 (1964). See also id., at 34-39 (dissenting opinion). This possibility and others serve to indicate the wisdom of refraining from any pronouncement now, and particularly from any rigid line drawing, in advance of consideration by the courts below and by the parties.
**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
Me. Justice Black, with whom The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Douglas join, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in the judgment and opinion of the Court, except for what is said in Part III, C, of the Court’s opinion. What the Court does in this part of its opinion is to reserve for future decision the question whether the States have power to enforce contracts under which someone claiming to have a new discovery can obtain payment for disclosing it while his patent application is pending, even though the discovery is later held to be unpatentable. This reservation is, as I see it, directly *677 in conflict with what this Court held to be the law in Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225 (1964), and Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U. S. 234 (1964). Brother Harlan concurred in the result in those cases, saying — contrary to what the Court held — “I see no reason why the State may not impose reasonable restrictions on the future ‘copying’ itself.” Compco, supra, at 239 . Consequently the Court is today joining in the kind of qualification that only Mr. Justice Harlan was willing to make at the time of our Stiff el and Compco decisions. I still entertain the belief I expressed for the Court in Stiffel and Compco that no State has a right to authorize any kind of monopoly on what is claimed to be a new invention, except when a patent has been obtained from the Patent Office under the exacting standards of the patent laws. One who makes a discovery may, of course, keep it secret if he wishes, but private arrangements under which self-styled “inventors” do not keep their discoveries secret, but rather disclose them, in return for contractual payments, run counter to the plan of our patent laws, which tightly regulate the kind of inventions that may be protected and the manner in which they may be protected. The national policy expressed in the patent laws, favoring free competition and narrowly limiting monopoly, cannot be frustrated by private agreements among individuals, with or without the approval of the State.

In reaching this conclusion, however, the court did express its belief that Adkins' invention made a "significant step forward" in the art of gyroscopy.  <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 915</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 341</citedDecision> .  It is far from clear that the court, in making this last statement, intended to hold that Adkins' ideas satisfied the demanding standard of invention explicated in our decision in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U. S. 1 (1966).  Surely, such a holding was not required by the court's analysis, which was concerned only with the question whether Lear had benefited from Adkins' ideas in any degree.  In this context, we believe that Lear must be required to address its arguments attacking the validity of the underlying patent to the California courts in the first instance.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
**Combined Opinion**
 In the first place, the question of validity has not been reached by the California Supreme Court, and when it is the patent may withstand attack.  In that event there will be no necessity to consider the impact of patent law on the enforceability of a contract grounded in state law. Second, even if the patent is declared invalid, the state court, after the parties have addressed themselves to the issues, may accommodate federal and state law in a matter which would not prompt review here.  Third, the parties themselves have neither briefed nor seriously argued the question in this Court, and we do not have the benefit of their views on what is surely a difficult question.  The Court itself has flushed the issue, which it now deals with on a piecemeal basis.  [2] Like the question of patent validity, I would leave the consequences of invalidity to the state court in the first instance.  NOTES [1]  Lear argues that this original agreement was not submitted in evidence at trial and so should not be considered a part of the record on appeal.  The California Supreme Court, however, treated the agreement as an important part of the record before it, <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 906</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 335</citedDecision> ; and so we are free to refer to it.

**Combined Opinion**
 The company argued, on the basis of federal as well as state cases, that a licensee may escape the impact of estoppel simply by announcing that it has repudiated the licensing agreement, regardless of the contract's terms.  See, e. g., Respondent's and Cross-Appellant's Opening Brief in Cases Nos. 28624 and 30089, at 110-111.  The California Supreme Court rejected this argument on its merits: "Lear relies on authorities holding that a licensee may terminate a license agreement upon notice to his licensor even though, prior to termination, there has been no adjudication of invalidity of the patent which is the subject of the agreement and that thereafter the licensee may challenge the validity of the patent.  (See, e. g., Armstrong Co. v. Shell Co. of Cal. (1929) 98 Cal. App. 769, 778-779 ).  This rule has no application if the agreement sets forth the particular circumstances under which termination must occur.  As stated above, such provisions must be complied with in order to effect a valid cancellation." <citedDecision>67 Cal. 2d, at 899</citedDecision> -900 n. 15, <citedDecision>435 P. 2d, at 331, n. 15</citedDecision> .  We clearly have jurisdiction to consider whether this decision is wrong.  In doing so, we have the duty to consider the broader implications of Lear's contention, and vindicate, if appropriate, its claim to relief on somewhat different grounds than it chose to advance below, especially when the California court recognized, in language we have already quoted, supra, at 656, that matters of basic principle are at stake.  [11]  There are two other early cases which enforced patent licenses without a thorough consideration of the estoppel issues that were presented.  In Eureka Co. v. Bailey Co., 11 Wall. 488 (1871), the Court held that a licensee was obliged to overcome a "very strong presumption" of patent validity in order to avoid his royalty obligations, without indicating how much more compelling a showing was required than was considered necessary in an ordinary infringement action.  In Dale Tile Manufacturing Co. v. Hyatt, 125 U. S. 46 (1888), this Court affirmed the decision of the New York state courts invoking the doctrine of licensee estoppel, on the ground that the estoppel question presented was one which involved only state law. [12] Edward Katzinger Co. v. Chicago Metallic Manufacturing Co., 329 U. S. 394 (1947); MacGregor v. Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co., 329 U. S. 402 (1947).
