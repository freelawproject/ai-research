**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice O’Connor, with whom Justice Powell and Justice Rehnquist join, dissenting.  The Court today surveys the battle scene of federalism and sounds a retreat.  Like Justice, Powell,.  I would prefer to hold the field and, at the very least, render a little aid to the wounded.  I join Justice Powell's opinion.  I also write separately to note my fundamental disagreement with the majority’s views of federalism and the duty of this Court. The Court overrules National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), on the grounds that it is not “faithful to the role of federalism in a democratic society.” Ante, at 546.  “The essence of our federal system,” the Court concludes, “is that within the realm of authority left open to them under the Constitution, the States must be equally free to engage in any activity that their citizens choose for the common weal.  ...” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> National League of Cities is held to be inconsistent with this narrow view of federalism because it attempts to protect only those fundamental aspects of state sovereignty that are essential to the States’ separate and independent existence, rather than protecting all state activities “equally.” In my view, federalism cannot be reduced to the weak “essence” distilled by the majority today.  There is more to federalism than the nature of the constraints that can be imposed on the States in “the realm of authority left open to them by the Constitution.” The central issue of federalism, *581 of course, is whether any realm is left open to the States by the Constitution — whether any area remains in which a State may act free of federal interference.  “The issue ... is whether the federal system has any legal substance, any core of constitutional right that courts will enforce.” C. Black, Perspectives in Constitutional Law 30 (1963).  The true “essence” of federalism is that the States as States have legitimate interests which the National Government is bound to respect even though its laws are supreme.  Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 44 (1971).  If federalism so conceived and so carefully cultivated by the Framers of our Constitution is to remain meaningful, this Court cannot abdicate its constitutional responsibility to oversee the Federal Government’s compliance with its duty to respect the legitimate interests of the States.  Due to the emergence of an integrated and industrialized national economy, this Court has been required to examine and review a breathtaking expansion of the powers of Congress.

 For example, Congress might rationally conclude that the location a State chooses for its capital may affect interstate commerce, but the Court has suggested that Congress would nevertheless be barred from dictating that location because such an exercise of a delegated power would undermine the state sovereignty inherent in the Tenth Amendment.  Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559, 565 (1911).  Similarly, Congress in the exercise of its taxing and spending powers can protect federal savings and loan associations, but if it chooses to do so by the means of converting quasi-public state savings and loan associations into federal associations, the Court has held that it contravenes the reserved powers of the States because the conversion is not a reasonably necessary exercise of power to reach the desired end.  Hopkins Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Cleary, 296 U. S. 315 (1935).  The operative language of these cases varies, but the underlying principle is consistent: state autonomy is a relevant factor in assessing the means by which Congress exercises its powers.  *587 This principle requires the Court to enforce affirmative limits on federal regulation of the States to complement the judicially crafted expansion of the interstate commerce power.  <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Usery</citedDecision> represented an attempt to define such limits.  The Court today rejects <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and washes its hands of all efforts to protect the States.  In the process, the Court opines that unwarranted federal encroachments on state authority are and will remain “‘horrible possibilities that never happen in the real world.”’ Ante, at 556, quoting New York v. United States, supra, at 583 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  There is ample reason to believe to the contrary.  The last two decades have seen an unprecedented growth of federal regulatory activity, as the majority itself acknowledges.  Ante, at 544-545, n. 10.  In 1954, one could still speak of a “burden of persuasion on those favoring national intervention” in asserting that “National action has .  .

 always been regarded as exceptional in our polity, an intrusion to be justified by some necessity, the special rather than the ordinary case.” Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government, 54 Colum. L. Rev. 543 , 544-545 (1954).  Today, as federal legislation and coercive grant programs have expanded to embrace innumerable activities that were once viewed as local, the burden of persuasion has surely shifted, and the extraordinary has become ordinary.  See Engdahl, Sense and Nonsense About State Immunity, 2 Constitutional Commentary 93 (1985).  For example, recently the Federal Government has, with this Court’s blessing, undertaken to tell the States the age at which they can retire their law enforcement officers, and the regulatory standards, procedures, and even the agenda which their utilities commissions must consider and follow.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742 (1982).  The political process *588 has not protected against these encroachments on state activities, even though they directly impinge on a State’s ability to make and enforce its laws.  With the abandonment of <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , all that stands between the remaining essentials of state sovereignty and Congress is the for self-restraint.  The problems of federalism in an integrated national economy are capable of more responsible resolution than holding that the States as States retain no status apart from that which Congress chooses to let them retain.  The proper resolution, I suggest, lies in weighing state autonomy as a factor in the balance when interpreting the means by which Congress can exercise its authority on the States as States.  It is insufficient, in assessing the validity of congressional regulation of a State pursuant to the commerce power, to ask only whether the same regulation would be valid if enforced against a private party.  That reasoning, embodied in the majority opinion, is inconsistent with the spirit of our Constitution.  It remains relevant that a State is being regulated, as <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and every recent case have recognized.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, supra; Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 684 (1982); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 287-288 (1981); National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 841-846</citedDecision> .  As far as the Constitution is concerned, a State should not be equated with any private litigant.  Cf. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 428 (1979) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (criticizing the ability of a state court to treat a sister State no differently than a private litigant).  Instead, the autonomy of a State is an essential component of federalism.  If state autonomy is ignored in assessing the means by which Congress regulates matters affecting commerce, then federalism becomes irrelevant simply because the set activities remaining beyond the reach of such a commerce power “may well be negligible.” Ante, at 545.  It has been difficult for this Court to craft bright fining the scope of the state autonomy protected by National *589 League of Cities.  Such difficulty is to be expected whenever constitutional concerns as important as federalism and the effectiveness of the commerce power come into conflict.  Regardless of the difficulty, it is and will remain the duty of this Court to reconcile these concerns in the final instance.  That the Court shuns the task today by appealing to the “essence of federalism” can provide scant comfort to those who believe our federal system requires something more than a unitary, centralized government.  I would not shirk the duty acknowledged by <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and its progeny, and I share Justice Rehnquist’s belief that this Court will in time again assume its constitutional responsibility.  I I respectfully dissent.
