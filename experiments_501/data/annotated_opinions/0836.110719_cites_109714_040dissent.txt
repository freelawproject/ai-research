**Dissenting Opinion**
 After all, what justifies the warrantless search is not probable cause alone, but probable cause coupled with the mobility of the automobile.  Because the scope of a warrantless search should depend on the scope of the justification for dispensing with a warrant, the entire premise of the majority’s opinion fails to support its conclusion.  The majority’s rule masks the startling assumption that a policeman’s determination of probable cause is the functional equivalent of the determination of a neutral and detached magistrate.  This assumption ignores a major premise of the warrant requirement — the importance of having a neutral and detached magistrate determine whether probable cause exists.  See supra, at 828-829.  The majority’s explanation that the scope of the warrantless automobile search will be “limited” to what a magistrate could authorize is thus inconsistent with our cases, which firmly establish that an on- *834 the-spot determination of probable cause is never the same as a decision by a neutral and detached magistrate.  C Our recent decisions in United States v. Chadwick, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1977), Arkansas v. Sanders, supra, and Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 (1981), clearly affirm that movable containers are different from automobiles for Fourth Amendment purposes.  In <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> , the Court drew a constitutional distinction between luggage and automobiles in terms of substantial differences in expectations of privacy.  <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 12</citedDecision> .  Moreover, the Court held that the mobility of such containers does not justify dispensing with a warrant, since federal agents had seized the luggage and safely transferred it to their custody under their exclusive control.  Sanders explicitly held that “the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies to personal luggage taken from an automobile to the same degree it applies to such luggage in other locations.” 442 U. S., at 766 .  And Robbins reaffirmed the Sanders rationale as applied to wrapped packages found in the unlocked luggage compartment of a vehicle.  453 U. S., at 425 .  3 In light of these considerations, I conclude that any movable container found within an automobile deserves precisely the same degree of Fourth Amendment warrant protection that it would deserve if found at a location outside the automobile.  See Sanders, 442 U. S., at 763-765 , and n. 13; <citedDecision>Chadwick, supra, at 17, n. 1</citedDecision> (Brennan, J., concurring).  <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> , as the majority notes, “reaffirmed the general principle that closed packages and containers may not be *835 searched without a warrant.” Ante, at 812.  Although there is no need to describe the exact contours of that protection in this dissenting opinion, it is clear enough that closed, opaque containers — regardless of whether they are “worthy” or are always used to store personal items — are ordinarily fully protected.  Cf. Sanders, supra, at 764, n. 13 .  4 Here, because respondent Ross had placed the evidence in question in a closed paper bag, the container could be seized, but not searched, without a warrant.  No practical exigencies required the warrantless searches on the street or at the station: Ross had been arrested and was in custody when both searches occurred, and the police succeeded in transporting the bag to the station without inadvertently spilling its contents.  5 II In announcing its new rule, the Court purports to rely on earlier automobile search cases, especially Carroll v. United States.  The Court’s approach, however, far from being “faithful to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that the Court has followed with substantial consistency throughout our history,” ante, at 824, is plainly contrary to the letter and the spirit of our prior automobile search cases. Moreover, the new rule produces anomalous and unacceptable consequences.

 The search will not always require a “combing” of the entire vehicle, since police may be looking for a particular item and may discover it promptly.  If, instead, they are looking more generally for evidence of a crime, the immediate opening of the container will not protect the defendant’s privacy; whether or not it contains contraband, the police will continue to search for new evidence.  Finally, the defendant, not the police, should be afforded the choice whether he prefers the immediate opening of his suitcase or other container to the delay incident to seeking a warrant.  Cf. Sanders, supra, at 764, n. 12 .  The more rea *839 sonable presumption, if a presumption is to replace the defendant’s consent, is surely that the immediate search of a closed container will be a greater invasion of the defendant’s privacy interests than a mere temporary seizure of the container.  8 B Finally, the majority’s new rule is theoretically unsound and will create anomalous and unwarranted results.  These consequences are readily apparent from the Court’s attempt to reconcile its new rule with the holdings of <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> and Sanders.  9 The Court suggests that probable cause to search only a container does not justify a warrantless search of an automobile in which it is placed, absent reason to believe that the contents could be secreted elsewhere in the vehicle.  This, the majority asserts, is an indication that the new rule is carefully limited to its justification, and is not inconsistent with <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> and Sanders.  But why is such a container more private, less difficult for police to seize and store, or in any other relevant respect more properly subject to the war *840 rant requirement, than a container that police discover in a probable-cause search of an entire automobile?  10 This rule plainly has peculiar and unworkable consequences: the Government “must show that the investigating officer knew enough but not too much, that he had sufficient knowledge to establish probable cause but insufficient knowledge to know exactly where the contraband was located.” 210 U. S. App. D. C. 342, 384, 655 F. 2d 1159, 1201 (1981) (en banc) (Wilkey, J., dissenting).  Alternatively, the majority may be suggesting that <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> and Sanders may be explained because the connection of the container to the vehicle was incidental in these two cases. That is, because police had pre-existing probable cause to seize and search the containers, they were not entitled to wait until the item was placed in a vehicle to take advantage of the automobile exception.  Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971); 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 519-525 (1978).  I wholeheartedly agree that police cannot employ a pretext to escape Fourth Amendment prohibitions and cannot rely on an exigency that they could easily have avoided.  This interpretation, however, might well be an exception that swallows up the majority’s rule.  In neither <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> nor Sanders did the Court suggest that the delay of the police was a pretext for taking advantage of the automobile exception.  For all that appears, the Government may have had legitimate reasons for not searching as soon as they had probable cause.  In any event, asking police to rely *841 on such an uncertain line in distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate searches for containers in automobiles hardly indicates that the majority’s approach has brought clarification to this area of the law. Ante, at 804; see Robbins, 453 U. S., at 435 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  11 I — I I — J HH The Court today ignores the clear distinction that <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> established between movable containers and automobiles.  It also rejects all of the relevant reasoning of Sanders 12 and offers a substitute rationale that appears inconsistent with the result.  See supra, at 832.  Sanders is therefore effectively overruled.  And the Court unambiguously overrules “the disposition” of Robbins, ante, at 824, though it gingerly avoids stating that it is overruling the case itself.  The only convincing explanation I discern for the majority’s broad rule is expediency: it assists police in conducting *842 automobile searches, ensuring that the private containers into which criminal suspects often place goods will no longer be a Fourth Amendment shield.  See ante, at 820.

 I would hesitate to rely upon the “profession’s understanding” of the Fourteenth Amendment or of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), in the early part of this century as justification for not granting Negroes constitutional protection.  See Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954).  Moreover, for a number of reasons, including the broad scope of the permitted search incident to arrest prior to Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), and the uncertain meaning of a “search” prior to Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967), the profession formerly advanced different arguments against automobile searches than it advances today.  Seizures of automobiles can be distinguished because of the greater interest of defendants in continuing possession of their means of transportation; in the case of automobiles, a seizure is more likely to be a greater intrusion than an immediate search.  See Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42, 51-52 (1970).  Both cases would appear to fall within the majority’s new rule.  In United States v. Chadwick, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1977), federal agents had probable cause to search a footlocker.  Although the footlocker had been placed in the trunk of a car and the occupants were about to depart, the Court refused to rely on the automobile exception to uphold the search.  (It is true that the United States did not argue in this Court that the search was justified pursuant to that exception, but the theory was hardly so novel that this Court could not have responsibly relied upon it.) In Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753 (1979), too, the suitcase was mobile and police had probable cause to search it; it was carried in an automobile for several blocks before the automobile was stopped and the suitcase was seized and searched.  Again, however, this Court invalidated the search.  In a footnote, the Court appears to suggest a more pragmatic rationale for distinguishing <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> and Sanders — that no practical problems comparable to those engendered by a general search of a vehicle would arise if the official suspicion is confined to a particular piece of luggage.  Ante, at 816, n. 21.  This suggestion is illogical.  A general search might disclose only a single item worth searching; conversely, pre-existing suspicion might attach to a number of items later placed in a car. Surely the protection of the warrant requirement cannot depend on a numerical count of the items subject to search.  Unless one of these alternative explanations is adopted, the Court’s attempt to distinguish the holdings in <citedDecision>Chadwick</citedDecision> and Sanders is not only unpersuasive but appears to contradict the Court’s own theory.  The Court suggests that in each case, the connection of the container to the vehicle was simply coincidental, and notes that the police did not have probable cause to search the entire vehicle.  But the police assuredly did have probable cause to search the vehicle for the container.  The Court states that the scope of the permitted warrantless search is determined only by what a magistrate could authorize.  Ante, at 823.  Once police found that container, according to the Court’s own rule, they should have been entitled to search at least the container without a warrant.  There was probable cause to search and the car was mobile in each case. The Court suggests that it rejects “some of the reasoning in Sanders.” Ante, at 824.
