 All Congress said in 1870 was that the 1866 law “is hereby re-enacted.” That is all Congress meant.  As we said in a somewhat different setting two Terms ago, “We think that history leaves no doubt that, if we are to give [the law] the scope that its origins dictate, we must accord it a sweep as broad as its language.” United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 801 .  “We are not at liberty to seek ingenious analytical instruments,” ibid., to carve from § 1982 an exception for private conduct — even though its application to such conduct in the present context is without established precedent.  And, as the Attorney General of the United States said at the oral argument of this case, “The fact that the statute lay partially dormant for many years cannot be held to diminish its force today.” Y. The remaining question is whether Congress has power under the Constitution to do what § 1982 purports to do: to prohibit all racial discrimination, private and public, in the sale and rental of property.  Our starting point is the Thirteenth Amendment, for it was pursuant *438 to that constitutional provision that Congress originally enacted what is now § 1982.  The Amendment consists of two parts.  Section 1 states: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” Section 2 provides: “Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” As its text reveals, the Thirteenth Amendment “is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.” Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 20</citedDecision> .  It has never been doubted, therefore, “that the power vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate legislation,” ibid., includes the power to enact laws “direct and primary, operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State legislation or not.” <citedDecision>Id., at 23</citedDecision> .  74 Thus, the fact that § 1982 operates upon the unofficial acts of private individuals, whether or not sanctioned by state law, presents no constitutional problem.  If Congress has power under the Thirteenth Amendment to eradicate conditions that prevent Negroes from buying and renting property because of their race or color, then no federal statute calculated to achieve that objective *439 can be thought to exceed the constitutional power of Congress simply because it reaches beyond state action to regulate the conduct of private individuals.  The constitutional question in this case, therefore, comes to this: Does the authority of Congress to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment “by appropriate legislation” include the power to eliminate all racial barriers to the acquisition of real and personal property?  We think the answer to that question is plainly yes.  “By its own unaided force and effect,” the Thirteenth Amendment “abolished slavery, and established universal freedom.” Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 20</citedDecision> .  Whether or not the Amendment itself did any more than that— a question not involved in this case — it is at least clear that the Enabling Clause of that Amendment empowered Congress to do much more.  For that clause clothed “Congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United StatesIbid.  (Emphasis added.) Those who opposed passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 argued in effect that the Thirteenth Amendment merely authorized Congress to dissolve the legal bond by which the Negro slave was held to his master.  75 Yet many had earlier opposed the Thirteenth Amendment on the very ground that it would give Congress virtually unlimited power to enact laws for the protection of Negroes in every State.  76 And the majority leaders in Congress — who were, after all, the authors of the Thirteenth Amendment — had no doubt that its Enabling Clause contemplated the sort of positive legislation that *440 was embodied in the 1866 Civil Rights Act.

 ... I have no doubt that under this provision ... we may destroy all these discriminations in civil rights against the black man; and if we cannot, our constitutional amendment amounts to nothing.  It was for that purpose that the second clause of that amendment was adopted, which says that Congress shall have authority, by appropriate legislation, to carry into effect the article prohibiting slavery.  Who is to decide what that appropriate legislation is to be?  The Congress of the United States; and it is for Congress to adopt such appropriate legislation as it may think proper, so that it be a means to accomplish the end.” 77 Surely Senator Trumbull was right.  Surely Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.  Nor can we say that the determination Congress has made is an irrational *441 one.  For this Court recognized long ago that, whatever else they may have encompassed, the badges and incidents of slavery — its “burdens and disabilities” — included restraints upon “those fundamental rights which are the essence of civil freedom, namely, the same right ... to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.” Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 22</citedDecision> .  78 Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil *442 War to restrict the free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes.  And when racial discrimination herds men *443 into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.  Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom — freedom to “go and come at pleasure” 79 and to “buy and sell when they please” 80 — would be left with “a mere paper guarantee” 81 if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man.  At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live.  If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep.  Representative Wilson of Iowa was the floor manager in the House for the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

 332 U. S. 789 .  Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 , invalidating a New Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community, or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, “except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected.” See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 12 .  Two of this Court’s early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action.  Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 ; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17.  But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra, actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322 .  See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 797-804 .  And of course the Civil Rights <citedDecision>Cases, supra,</citedDecision> which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 335 , did not'involve the present statute at all. It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31 , characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , as having “held” that “[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute .  .  .  [are] directed is governmental action.” 334 U. S., at 31.  But no such statement appears in the Corrigan opinion, and a careful examination of Corrigan reveals that it cannot be read as authority for the proposition attributed to it in Hurd .  In Corrigan , suits had been brought to enjoin a threatened violation of certain restrictive covenants in the District of Columbia.  The courts of the District had granted relief, see 55 App. D. C. 30, 299 F. 899 , and the case reached this Court on appeal.

 .  .  local laws” were made subject to the criminal sanctions of § 2.  Ibid. Congress might have thought it appropriate to confine criminal punishment to state officials, oath-bound to support the supreme federal law, while allowing only civil remedies — or perhaps only preventive relief — against private violators.  Or Congress might have thought that States which did not authorize abridgment of the rights declared in § 1 would themselves punish all who interfered with those rights without official authority.  See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1758, 1785.  Cf. Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 19, 24-25</citedDecision> .  Whatever the reason, it was repeatedly stressed that the only violations “reached and punished” by the bill, see Cong.

See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 39, 474, 516-517, 602-603, 1123-1125, 1151-1153, 1160.  For the substance of the codes and their operation, see H. R. Exec. Doc.

The Court did conclude in the <citedDecision>Civil Rights Cases</citedDecision> that “the act of .  .  .  the owner of the inn, the public conveyance or place of amusement, refusing .  .  .  accommodation” cannot be “justly regarded as imposing any badge of slavery or servitude upon the applicant.” <citedDecision>109 U. S., at 24</citedDecision> .  “It would be running the slavery argument into the ground,” the Court thought, “to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to the guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car, or admit to his concert or theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business.” <citedDecision>Id., at 24-25</citedDecision> .  Mr. Justice Harlan dissented, expressing the view that “such discrimination practised by corporations and individuals in the exercise of their public or quasi-public functions is a badge of servitude the imposition of which Congress may prevent under its power, by appropriate legislation, to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment.” <citedDecision>Id., at 43</citedDecision> .  Whatever the present validity of the position taken by the majority on that issue — a question rendered largely academic by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243 (see Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 ; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 ) — we note that the entire Court agreed upon at least one proposition: .The Thirteenth Amendment authorizes Congress not only to outlaw all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude but also to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of a society half slave and half free, by securing to all citizens, of every race and color, “the same right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.” <citedDecision>109 U. S., at 22</citedDecision> .  Cf. <citedDecision>id., at 35</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  In Hodges v. United States, 203 U. S. 1 , a group of white men had terrorized several Negroes to prevent them from working in a *442 sawmill.  The terrorizes were convicted under 18 U. S. C. § 241 (then Revised Statutes § 5508) of conspiring to prevent the Negroes from exercising the right to contract for employment, a right secured by 42 U. S. C. § 1981 (then Revised Statutes § 1977, derived from § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, see n. 28, supra).  Section 1981 provides, in terms that closely parallel those of § 1982 (then Revised Statutes § 1978), that all persons in the United States “shall have the same right ... to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens ...” (Emphasis added.) This Court reversed the conviction.  The majority recognized that "one of the disabilities of slavery, one of the indicia of its existence, was a lack of power to make or perform contracts.” 203 U. S., at 17 .  And there was no doubt that the defendants had deprived their Negro victims, on racial grounds, of the opportunity to dispose of their labor by contract.

Mr. Justice Harlan, joined by Mr. Justice Day, dissented.  In their view, the interpretation the majority placed upon the Thirteenth Amendment was “entirely too narrow and .  .  .  hostile to the freedom established by the supreme law of the land.” 203 U. S., at 37 .  That interpretation went far, they thought, “towards neutralizing many declarations made as to the object of the recent Amendments of the Constitution, a common purpose of which, this court has said, was to secure to a people theretofore in servitude, the free enjoyment, without discrimination merely on account of their race, of the essential rights that appertain to American citizenship and to freedom.” Ibid. The conclusion of the majority in Hodges rested upon a concept of congressional power under the Thirteenth Amendment irrecon *443 cilable with the position taken by every member of this Court in the <citedDecision>Civil Rights Cases</citedDecision> and incompatible with the history and purpose of the Amendment itself.

Me. Justice Douglas, concurring. The Act of April 9, 1866, 14 Stat. 27 , 42 U. S .C. § 1982, provides: “All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, aiid convey real and personal property.” This Act was passed to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment which in § 1 abolished “slavery” and “involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted” and in. § 2 gave Congress power “to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” Enabling a Negro to buy and sell real and personal property is a removal of one of many badges of slavery. “Slaves were not considered men. . . . They could own nothing; they could make no contracts; they could hold no property, nor traffic in property; they could not hire out; they could not legally marry nor constitute families; they could not control their children; they could not appeal from their master; they could be punished at will.” W. Dubois, Black Reconstruction in America 10 (1964) , 1 *445 The true curse of slavery is not what it did to the black man, but what it has done to the white man. For the existence of the institution produced the notion that the white man was of superior character, intelligence, and morality. The blacks were little more than livestock— to be fed and fattened for the economic benefits they could bestow through their labors, and to be subjected to authority, often with cruelty, to make clear who was master and who slave. Some badges of slavery remain today. While the institution has been outlawed, it has remained in the minds and hearts of many white men. Cases which have come to this Court depict a spectacle of slavery unwilling to die. We have seen contrivances by States designed to thwart Negro voting, e. g., Lane, v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268 . Negroes have been excluded over and again from juries solely on account of their race, e. g., Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 , or have been forced to sit in segregated seats in courtrooms, Johnson v. Virginia, 373 U. S. 61 . They have been made to attend segregated and inferior schools, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 , or been denied entrance to colleges or graduate schools because of their color, e. g., Pennsylvania v. Board of Trusts, 353 U. S. 230 ; Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629 . Negroes have been prosecuted for marrying whites, e. g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 . They have been forced to live in segregated residential districts, Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60 , and residents of white neighborhoods have denied them entrance, e. g., Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1 . Negroes have been forced to use segregated facilities in going about their daily lives, having been excluded from railway coaches, Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 ; public parks, New Orleans Park Improvement Assn. v. Detiege, 358 U. S. 54 ; restaurants, Lombard v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 267 ; public beaches, Mayor of Baltimore v. Dawson, 350 U. S. 877 ; municipal *446 golf courses, Holmes v. City of Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 ; amusement parks, Griffin v. Maryland, 378 U. S. 130 ; buses, Gayle v. Browder, 352 U. S. 903 ; public libraries, Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U. S. 131 . A state court judge in Alabama convicted a Negro woman of contempt of court because she refused to answer him when he addressed her as “Mary,” although she had made the simple request to be called “Miss Hamilton.” Hamilton v. Alabama, 376 U. S. 650 . That brief sampling of discriminatory practices, many of which continue today, stands almost as an annotation to what Frederick Douglass (1817-1895) wrote nearly a century earlier: “Of all the races and varieties of men which have suffered from this feeling, the colored people of this country have endured most. They can resort to no disguises which will enable them to escape its deadly aim. They carry in front the evidence which marks them for persecution. They stand at the extreme point of difference from the Caucasian race, and their African origin can be instantly recognized, though they may be several removes from the typical African race. They may remonstrate like Shylock— ‘Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter, as a Christian is?’ — but such eloquence is unavailing. They are Negroes — and that is enough, in the eye of this unreasoning prejudice, to justify indignity and violence. In nearly every department of American life they are confronted by this insidious influence. It fills the air. It meets them at the workshop and factory, when they apply for work. It meets them at the church, at the hotel, at the *447 ballot-box, and worst of all, it meets them in the jury-box. Without crime or offense against law or gospel, the colored man is the Jean Yaljean of American society. He has escaped from the galleys, and hence all presumptions are against him. The workshop denies him work, and the inn denies him shelter; the ballot-box a fair vote, and the jury-box a fair trial. He has ceased to be the slave of an individual, but has in some sense become the slave of society. He may not now be bought and sold like a beast in the market, but he is the trammeled victim of a prejudice, well calculated to repress his manly ambition, paralyze his energies, and make him a dejected and spiritless man, if not a sullen enemy to society, fit to prey upon life and property and to make trouble generally.” 2 Today the black is protected by a host of civil rights laws. But the forces of discrimination are still strong. A member of his race, duly elected by the people to a state legislature, is barred from that assembly because of his views on the Vietnam war. Bond v. Floyd, 385 U. S. 116 . Real estate agents use artifice to avoid selling “white property” to the blacks. 3 The blacks who travel the country, though entitled by law to the facilities for sleeping and dining that are offered all tourists, Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 , may well learn that the “vacancy” sign does not mean what it says, especially if the motel has a swimming pool. On entering a half-empty restaurant they may find “reserved” signs on all unoccupied tables. *448 The black is often barred from a labor union because of his race. 4 He learns that the order directing admission of his children into white schools has not been obeyed “with all deliberate speed/’ Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 301 , but has been delayed by numerous stratagems and devices. 5 State laws, at times, have even en *449 couraged discrimination in housing. Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369 . This recital is enough to show how prejudices, once part and parcel of slavery, still persist. The men who sat in Congress in 1866 were trying to remove some of the badges or “customs” 6 of slavery when they enacted § 1982. And, as my Brother Stewart shows, the Congress that passed the so-called Open Housing Act in 1968 did not undercut any of the grounds on which § 1982 rests. The cases are collected in five volumes in H. Catterall, Judicial Cases Concerning American Slavery and the Negro (1926-1937). And see 1 T. Cobb, An Inquiry into the Law of Negro Slavery, c. XIV (1858); G. Ostrander, The Rights of Man in America 1606-1861, p. 252 (1960); G. Stroud, Sketch of the Laws Relating to Slavery 45-50 (1827); J. Wheeler, Law of Slavery 190-191 (1837).

The contrivances which some States have concocted to thwart the command of our decision in Brown v. Board of Education are by now legendary. See, e. g., Monroe v. Board of Commissioners, 391 U.

My Brother Harlan’s listing of some of the “customs” prevailing in the North at the time § 1982 was first enacted shows the extent of organized white discrimination against newly freed blacks. As he states, “ [residential segregation was the prevailing pattern almost everywhere in the North.” Post, at 474-475. Certainly, then, it was “customary.” To suggest, however, that there might be room for argument in this case (post, at 475, n. 65) that the discrimination against petitioners was not in some measure a part and product of this longstanding and widespread customary pattern is to pervert the problem by allowing the legal mind to draw lines and make distinctions that have no place in the jurisprudence of a nation striving to rejoin the human race.

 Moreover, the political processes of our own era have, since the date of oral argument in this case, given birth to a civil rights statute 2 embodying “fair housing” provisions 3 which would at the end of this year make available to others, though apparently not to the petitioners themselves, 4 the type of relief which the petitioners now seek.  It seems to me that this latter factor so diminishes the public importance of this case that by far the wisest course would be for this Court to refrain from decision and to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.  I.  I shall deal first with the Court’s construction of § 1982, which lies at the heart of its opinion.  That construction is that the statute applies to purely private as well as to state-authorized discrimination.  A. The Court’s opinion focuses upon the statute’s legislative history, but it is worthy of note that the precedents in this Court are distinctly opposed to the Court’s view of the statute.  *451 In the Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3</citedDecision> , decided less than two decades after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, from which § 1982 is derived, the Court said in dictum of the 1866 Act: “This law is clearly corrective in its character, intended to counteract and furnish redress against State laws and proceedings, and customs having the force of law, which sanction the wrongful acts specified.  .  .  .  The Civil Rights Bill here referred to is analogous in its character to what a law would have been under the original Constitution, declaring that the validity of contracts should not be impaired, and that if any person bound by a contract should refuse to comply with it, under color or pretence that it had been rendered void or invalid by a State law, he should be liable to an action upon it in the courts of the United States, with the addition of a penalty for setting up such an unjust and unconstitutional defence.” Id., at 16-17.  5 In Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , the question was whether the courts of the District of Columbia might enjoin prospective breaches of racially restrictive covenants.  The Court held that it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioners’ argument that the covenant was void because it contravened the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments and their implementing statutes.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 59 Only five States accorded equal voting rights to Negroes, 60 and it appears that Negroes were allowed to serve on juries only in Massachusetts.  61 Residential segregation was the prevailing pattern almost every *475 where in the North.  62 There were no state “fair housing” laws in 1866, and it appears that none had ever been proposed.  63 In this historical context, I cannot conceive that a bill thought to prohibit purely private discrimination not only.in the sale or rental of housing but in all property transactions would not have received a great deal of criticism explicitly directed to this feature.  The fact that the 1866 Act received no criticism of this kind 64 is for me strong additional evidence that it was not regarded as extending so far.  In sum, the most which can be said with assurance about the intended impact of the 1866 Civil Rights Act upon purely private discrimination is that the Act probably was envisioned by most members of Congress as prohibiting official, community-sanctioned discrimination in the South, engaged in pursuant to local “customs” which in the recent time of slavery probably were embodied in laws or regulations.  65 Acts done under the *476 color of such “customs” were, of course, said by the Court in the Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3</citedDecision> , to constitute “state action” prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.  See <citedDecision>id., at 16, 17, 21</citedDecision> .  Adoption of a “state action” construction of the Civil Rights Act would therefore have the additional merit of bringing its interpretation into line with that of the Fourteenth Amendment, which this Court has consistently held to reach only “state action.” This seems especially desirable in light of the wide agreement that a major purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, at least in the minds of its congressional proponents, was to assure that the rights conferred by the then recently enacted Civil Rights Act could not be taken away by a subsequent Congress.  66 II.  The foregoing, I think, amply demonstrates that the Court has chosen to resolve this ease by according to a loosely worded statute a meaning which is open to the strongest challenge in light of the statute’s legislative history.  In holding that the Thirteenth Amendment is sufficient constitutional authority for § 1982 as interpreted, the Court also decides a question of great importance.  Even contemporary supporters of the aims of the 1866 Civil Rights Act doubted that those goals could constitutionally be achieved under the Thirteenth Amendment, 67 and this Court has twice expressed similar *477 doubts.  See Hodges v. United States, 203 U. S. 1, 16-18 ; Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323, 330 .  But cf. Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 22</citedDecision> .  Thus, it is plain that the course of decision followed by the Court today entails the resolution of important and difficult issues.  The only apparent way of deciding this case without reaching those issues would be to hold that the petitioners are entitled to relief on the alternative ground advanced by them: that the respondents’ conduct amounted to “state action” forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.  However, that route is not without formidable obstacles of its own, for the opinion of the Court of Appeals makes it clear that this case differs substantially from any “state action” case previously decided by this Court. See 379 F. 2d, at 40-45.  The fact that a case is “hard” does not, of course, relieve a judge of his duty to decide it.  Since, the Court did vote to hear this case, I normally would consider myself obligated to decide whether the petitioners are entitled to relief on either of the grounds on which they rely.  After mature reflection, however, I have concluded that this is one of those rare instances in which an event which occurs after the hearing of argument so diminishes a case’s public significance, when viewed in light of the difficulty of the questions presented, as to justify this Court in dismissing the writ as improvidently granted.

V. The remaining question is whether Congress has power under the Constitution to do what § 1982 purports to do: to prohibit all racial discrimination, private and public, in the sale and rental of property.  Our starting point is the Thirteenth Amendment, for it was pursuant *438 to that constitutional provision that Congress originally enacted what is now § 1982.  The Amendment consists of two parts.  Section 1 states: "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction." Section 2 provides: "Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation." As its text reveals, the Thirteenth Amendment "is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States." Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 20</citedDecision> .  It has never been doubted, therefore, "that the power vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate legislation," ibid., includes the power to enact laws "direct and primary, operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State legislation or not." <citedDecision>Id., at 23</citedDecision> .  [74] Thus, the fact that § 1982 operates upon the unofficial acts of private individuals, whether or not sanctioned by state law, presents no constitutional problem.  If Congress has power under the Thirteenth Amendment to eradicate conditions that prevent Negroes from buying and renting property because of their race or color, then no federal statute calculated to achieve that objective *439 can be thought to exceed the constitutional power of Congress simply because it reaches beyond state action to regulate the conduct of private individuals.  The constitutional question in this case, therefore, comes to this: Does the authority of Congress to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment "by appropriate legislation" include the power to eliminate all racial barriers to the acquisition of real and personal property?  We think the answer to that question is plainly yes.  "By its own unaided force and effect," the Thirteenth Amendment "abolished slavery, and established universal freedom." Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 20</citedDecision> .  Whether or not the Amendment itself did any more than that a question not involved in this caseit is at least clear that the Enabling Clause of that Amendment empowered Congress to do much more.  For that clause clothed "Congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States.  " <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> (Emphasis added.) Those who opposed passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 argued in effect that the Thirteenth Amendment merely authorized Congress to dissolve the legal bond by which the Negro slave was held to his master.  [75] Yet many had earlier opposed the Thirteenth Amendment on the very ground that it would give Congress virtually unlimited power to enact laws for the protection of Negroes in every State.  [76] And the majority leaders in Congresswho were, after all, the authors of the Thirteenth Amendmenthad no doubt that its Enabling Clause contemplated the sort of positive legislation that *440 was embodied in the 1866 Civil Rights Act.  Their chief spokesman, Senator Trumbull of Illinois, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had brought the Thirteenth Amendment to the floor of the Senate in 1864.  In defending the constitutionality of the 1866 Act, he argued that, if the narrower construction of the Enabling Clause were correct, then "the trumpet of freedom that we have been blowing throughout the land has given an `uncertain sound,' and the promised freedom is a delusion.  Such was not the intention of Congress, which proposed the constitutional amendment, nor is such the fair meaning of the amendment itself.
**Combined Opinion**
 Surely Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.  Nor can we say that the determination Congress has made is an irrational *441 one.  For this Court recognized long ago that, whatever else they may have encompassed, the badges and incidents of slaveryits "burdens and disabilities"included restraints upon "those fundamental rights which are the essence of civil freedom, namely, the same right .  .  .  to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens." Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 22</citedDecision> .  [78] Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil *442 War to restrict the free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes.  And when racial discrimination herds men *443 into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.  Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedomfreedom to "go and come at pleasure" [79] and to "buy and sell when they please" [80] would be left with "a mere paper guarantee" [81] if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man.  At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live.  If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep.  Representative Wilson of Iowa was the floor manager in the House for the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

 Moreover, the political processes of our own era have, since the date of oral argument in this case, given birth to a civil rights statute [2] embodying "fair housing" provisions [3] which would at the end of this year make available to others, though apparently not to the petitioners themselves, [4] the type of relief which the petitioners now seek.  It seems to me that this latter factor so diminishes the public importance of this case that by far the wisest course would be for this Court to refrain from decision and to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.  I.  I shall deal first with the Court's construction of § 1982, which lies at the heart of its opinion.  That construction is that the statute applies to purely private as well as to state-authorized discrimination.  A. The Court's opinion focuses upon the statute's legislative history, but it is worthy of note that the precedents in this Court are distinctly opposed to the Court's view of the statute.  *451 In the Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3</citedDecision> , decided less than two decades after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, from which § 1982 is derived, the Court said in dictum of the 1866 Act: "This law is clearly corrective in its character, intended to counteract and furnish redress against State laws and proceedings, and customs having the force of law, which sanction the wrongful acts specified.. .  .  The Civil Rights Bill here referred to is analogous in its character to what a law would have been under the original Constitution, declaring that the validity of contracts should not be impaired, and that if any person bound by a contract should refuse to comply with it, under color or pretence that it had been rendered void or invalid by a State law, he should be liable to an action upon it in the courts of the United States, with the addition of a penalty for setting up such an unjust and unconstitutional defence." Id., at 16-17.  [5] In Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , the question was whether the courts of the District of Columbia might enjoin prospective breaches of racially restrictive covenants.  The Court held that it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioners' argument that the covenant was void because it contravened the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments and their implementing statutes.  The Court reasoned, inter alia, that the statutes, including the immediate predecessor of § 1982, [6] were inapplicable because "they, like the Constitutional Amendment under whose sanction they were enacted, do not in any manner prohibit or invalidate contracts entered into *452 by private individuals in respect to the control and disposition of their own property."

 [24]  Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 , invalidating a New Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community, or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, "except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected." See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 12 .  [25]  Two of this Court's early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action.  Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 ; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17.  But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra , actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322.  See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 797-804 .  And of course the Civil Rights <citedDecision>Cases, supra</citedDecision> , which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 335 , did not involve the present statute at all. It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31 , characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , as having "held" that "[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute .  .  .  [are] directed is governmental action." 334 U. S., at 31.  But no such statement appears in the Corrigan opinion, and a careful examination of Corrigan reveals that it cannot be read as authority for the proposition attributed to it in Hurd .  In Corrigan , suits had been brought to enjoin a threatened violation of certain restrictive covenants in the District of Columbia.

Congress might have thought it appropriate to confine criminal punishment to state officials, oath-bound to support the supreme federal law, while allowing only civil remediesor perhaps only preventive reliefagainst private violators.  Or Congress might have thought that States which did not authorize abridgment of the rights declared in § 1 would themselves punish all who interfered with those rights without official authority.  See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1758, 1785.  Cf. Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 19, 24-25</citedDecision> .

That remark, however, was nothing more than a reply to Senator Cowan's charge that § 2 was "exceedingly objectionable" in singling out state judicial officers for punishment for the first time "in the history of civilized legislation."

S., at 24</citedDecision> .  "It would be running the slavery argument into the ground," the Court thought, "to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to the guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car, or admit to his concert or theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business." <citedDecision>Id., at 24-25</citedDecision> .  Mr. Justice Harlan dissented, expressing the view that "such discrimination practised by corporations and individuals in the exercise of their public or quasi-public functions is a badge of servitude the imposition of which Congress may prevent under its power, by appropriate legislation, to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment." <citedDecision>Id., at 43</citedDecision> .  Whatever the present validity of the position taken by the majority on that issuea question rendered largely academic by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243 (see Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 ; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 )we note that the entire Court agreed upon at least one proposition: The Thirteenth Amendment authorizes Congress not only to outlaw all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude but also to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of a society half slave and half free, by securing to all citizens, of every race and color, "the same right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens." <citedDecision>109 U. S., at 22</citedDecision> .  Cf. <citedDecision>id., at 35</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  In Hodges v. United States, 203 U. S. 1 , a group of white men had terrorized several Negroes to prevent them from working in a sawmill.  The terrorizers were convicted under 18 U. S. C. § 241 (then Revised Statutes § 5508) of conspiring to prevent the Negroes from exercising the right to contract for employment, a right secured by 42 U. S. C. § 1981 (then Revised Statutes § 1977, derived from § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, see n. 28, supra ).  Section 1981 provides, in terms that closely parallel those of § 1982 (then Revised Statutes § 1978), that all persons in the United States "shall have the same right .  .  .  to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens .

 In their view, the interpretation the majority placed upon the Thirteenth Amendment was "entirely too narrow and .  .  .  hostile to the freedom established by the supreme law of the land." 203 U. S., at 37 .  That interpretation went far, they thought, "towards neutralizing many declarations made as to the object of the recent Amendments of the Constitution, a common purpose of which, this court has said, was to secure to a people theretofore in servitude, the free enjoyment, without discrimination merely on account of their race, of the essential rights that appertain to American citizenship and to freedom." Ibid. The conclusion of the majority in Hodges rested upon a concept of congressional power under the Thirteenth Amendment irreconcilable with the position taken by every member of this Court in the <citedDecision>Civil Rights Cases</citedDecision> and incompatible with the history and purpose of the Amendment itself.  Insofar as Hodges is inconsistent with our holding today, it is hereby overruled.  [79]  See text accompanying n. 48, supra. [80] Ibid. [81]  See text accompanying n. 62, supra. [82]  Cong.
