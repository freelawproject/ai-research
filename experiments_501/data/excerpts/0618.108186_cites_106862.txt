**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 The decision evinces, I think, a recognition that the “incor-porationist” view of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which underlay Duncan and is now carried forward into Baldwin, must be tempered to allow the States more elbow room in ordering their own criminal systems.  With that much I agree.  But to accomplish this by diluting constitutional protections within the federal system itself is something to which I cannot possibly subscribe.  Tempering the rigor of Duncan should be done forthrightly, by facing up to the fact that at least in this area the “incorporation” doctrine does not fit well with our federal structure, and by the same token that Duncan was wrongly decided.  1 would sustain both the Florida and New York statutes on the constitutional premises discussed in my dissenting opinion in Duncan, 391 U. S., at 161 et seq. In taking that course in Baldwin, I cannot, in a matter that goes to the very pulse of sound constitutional adjudication, consider myself constricted by stare decisis.  3 *119 Accordingly, I dissent in No. 188 and, as to the jury issue, concur in the result in No. 927.  Given Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1964), I join that part of the Court’s opinion in No. 927 relating to the Florida “alibi” procedure.  I As a predicate for my conclusions, it is useful to map the circuitous route that has been taken in order to reach the results.  In both cases, more patently in Williams than in Baldwin, the history of jury trial practice in both the state and federal systems has been indiscriminately jumbled together as opposed to the point of departure having been taken from the language in which the federal guarantee is expressed and the historical precedent that brings it to life. The consequence of this inverted approach to interpreting the Sixth Amendment results, fortuitously, 4 in Baldwin in a Sixth Amendment rule that would be reached under the correct approach, given the “incorporationist” philosophy of Duncan , but, unhappily, imposes it on the one jurisdiction in the country that has seen fit to do otherwise; and in Williams results in a Sixth Amendment rule that could only be reached by standing the constitutional dialectic on its head.  A To the extent that the prevailing opinion premises its conclusions in the Baldwin case on federal precedent and the common-law practice, I agree that the federal right to *120 jury trial attaches where an offense is punishable by as much as six months’ imprisonment.  I think this follows both from the breadth of the language of the Sixth Amendment, which provides for a jury in “all criminal prosecutions,” and the evidence of historical practice.  In this regard I believe that contemporary usage in the States is of little, if any, significance.  5 For if exceptions are to be created out of the all-embracing language of the Sixth Amendment they should only be those that are anchored in history.

 A The recent history of constitutional adjudication in state criminal cases is the ascendancy of the doctrine of ad hoc (“selective”) incorporation, an approach that absorbs one-by-one individual guarantees of the federal Bill of Rights into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and holds them applicable to the States with all the subtleties and refinements born of history *131 and embodied in case experience developed in the context of federal adjudication.  Thus, with few exceptions the Court has “incorporated,” each time over my protest, 14 almost all the criminal protections found within the first eight Amendments to the Constitution, and made them “jot-for-jot and case-for-case” applicable to the States.  The process began with Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), where the Court applied to the States the so-called exclusionary rule, rendering inadmissible at trial evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and thereby overruling pro tanto Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949).  See my dissenting opinion, 367 U. S., at 672 .  The particular course embarked upon in Mapp was blindly followed to its end in Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963), where the Court made federal standards of probable cause for search and seizure applicable to the States, thereby overruling the remainder of Wolf.  See my opinion concurring in the result, 374 U. S., at 44 .  Thereafter followed Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1964), and Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), overruling Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908), and Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46 (1947), and incorporating the *132 Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination by holding that “the same standards must determine whether an accused's silence in either a federal or state proceeding is justified.” <citedDecision>378 U. S., at 11</citedDecision> .  See my dissenting opinion in Malloy, <citedDecision>378 U. S., at 14</citedDecision> , and my concurring opinion in Griffin, 380 U. S., at 615 .  The year of Griffin also brought forth Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400 (1965), overruling Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97 (1934), and Stein v. New York, 346 U. S. 156, 194 (1953), by holding that the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause applied equally to the States and Federal Government.  See my opinion concurring in the result, 380 U. S., at 408.  In 1967 incorporation swept in the “speedy trial” guarantee of the Sixth Amendment.  Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213 (1967), and in 1968 Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, rendered the Sixth Amendment jury trial a right secured by the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause.  Only last Term the Court overruled Palko v. Connecticut, supra, and held that the “double jeopardy” protection of the Fifth Amendment was incorporated into the Fourteenth, and hence also carried to the States.  Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969); see my opinion concurring in the result in Klopfer, 386 U. S., at 226 ; my dissenting opinion in Duncan, 391 U. S., at 171 ; my dissenting opinion in Benton, 395 U. S., at 801 , and my separate opinion in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 744 (1969).
