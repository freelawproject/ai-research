 We find no reason for disturbing the trial court's finding that the confession was voluntary." [4] 28 Ill. 2d 41, 45-46 , 190 N. E. 2d 825, 827 .  The court also held, on the authority of this Court's decisions in Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 , and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , that the confession was admissible even though "it was obtained after he had requested the assistance of counsel, which request was denied." 28 Ill. 2d, at 46 , 190 N. E. 2d, at 827 .  We granted a writ of certiorari to consider whether the petitioner's statement was constitutionally admissible at his trial. 375 U. S. 902 .  We conclude, for the reasons stated below, that it was not and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of conviction.  In Massiah v. United States, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 201</citedDecision> , this Court observed that "a Constitution which guarantees a defendant the aid of counsel at .  .  .  trial could surely vouchsafe no less to an indicted defendant under interrogation by the police in a completely extrajudicial proceeding.  Anything less .  .  .  might deny a defendant `effective representation by counsel at the only stage when *485 legal aid and advice would help him.' " <citedDecision>Id., at 204</citedDecision> , quoting DOUGLAS, J., concurring in Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 326 .  The interrogation here was conducted before petitioner was formally indicted.  But in the context of this case, that fact should make no difference.  When petitioner requested, and was denied, an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, the investigation had ceased to be a general investigation of "an unsolved crime." Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 327 (STEWART, J., concurring).  Petitioner had become the accused, and the purpose of the interrogation was to "get him" to confess his guilt despite his constitutional right not to do so. At the time of his arrest and throughout the course of the interrogation, the police told petitioner that they had convincing evidence that he had fired the fatal shots.  Without informing him of his absolute right to remain silent in the face of this accusation, the police urged him to make a statement.

Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532, 562 .  Petitioner, a layman, was undoubtedly unaware that under Illinois law an admission of "mere" complicity in the murder plot was legally as damaging as an admission of firing of the fatal shots.  Illinois v. Escobedo, 28 Ill. 2d 41 , 190 N. E. 2d 825 .  The "guiding hand of counsel" was essential to advise petitioner of his rights in this delicate situation.  Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 69 .  This was the "stage when legal aid and advice" were most critical to petitioner.  <citedDecision>Massiah</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 204.  It was a stage surely as critical as was the arraignment in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 , and the preliminary hearing in White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 .  What happened at this interrogation could certainly "affect the whole trial," Hamilton v. Alabama, supra, at 54, since rights "may be as irretrievably lost, if not then and there asserted, as they are when an accused represented by counsel waives a right for strategic purposes." Ibid. It would exalt form over substance to make the right to counsel, under these circumstances, depend on whether at the time of the interrogation, the authorities had secured a formal indictment.  Petitioner had, for all practical purposes, already been charged with murder.  The New York Court of Appeals, whose decisions this Court cited with approval in Massiah, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 201, at 205</citedDecision> , has recently recognized that, under circumstances such as those here, no meaningful distinction can be drawn between interrogation of an accused before and after formal indictment.  In People v. Donovan, 13 N. Y. 2d 148, 193 N. E. 2d 628 , that court, in an opinion by Judge Fuld, held that a "confession taken from a defendant, during a period of detention [prior to indictment], after his attorney had requested and been denied access *487 to him" could not be used against him in a criminal trial. [6] Id., at 151, 193 N. E. 2d, at 629 .  The court observed that it "would be highly incongruous if our system of justice permitted the district attorney, the lawyer representing the State, to extract a confession from the accused while his own lawyer, seeking to speak with him, was kept from him by the police." Id., at 152, 193 N. E. 2d, at 629 .  [7] In Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 , we held that every person accused of a crime, whether state or federal, is entitled to a lawyer at trial. [8] The rule sought by the State here, however, would make the trial no more than an appeal from the interrogation; and the "right to use counsel at the formal trial [would be] a very hollow thing [if], for all practical purposes, the conviction is already assured by pretrial examination." In re Groban, 352 U. S. *488 330, 344 (BLACK, J., dissenting).  [9] "One can imagine a cynical prosecutor saying: `Let them have the most illustrious counsel, now.  They can't escape the noose.  There is nothing that counsel can do for them at the trial.' " Ex parte Sullivan, 107 F. Supp. 514, 517-518 .  It is argued that if the right to counsel is afforded prior to indictment, the number of confessions obtained by the police will diminish significantly, because most confessions are obtained during the period between arrest and indictment, [10] and "any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under any circumstances." Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 59 (Jackson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  This argument, of course, cuts two ways.  The fact that many confessions are obtained during this period points up its critical nature as a "stage when legal aid and advice" are surely needed.  <citedDecision>Massiah</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 204; Hamilton v. Alabama, supra ; White v. Maryland, supra .  The right to counsel would indeed be hollow if it began at a period when few confessions were obtained.  There is necessarily a direct relationship between the importance of a stage to the police in their quest for a confession and the criticalness of that stage to the accused in his need for legal advice.  Our Constitution, unlike some others, strikes the balance in favor of the right of the accused to be advised by his lawyer of his privilege against self-incrimination.  See Note, 73 Yale L. J. 1000, 1048-1051 (1964).  We have learned the lesson of history, ancient and modern, that a system of criminal law enforcement *489 which comes to depend on the "confession" will, in the long run, be less reliable [11] and more subject to abuses [12] than a system which depends on extrinsic evidence independently secured through skillful investigation.  As Dean Wigmore so wisely said: "[ A ] ny system of administration which permits the prosecution to trust habitually to compulsory self-disclosure as a source of proof must itself suffer morally thereby.

 Reversed and remanded.  MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.  I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois on the basis of Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , *493 decided by this Court only six years ago.  Like my Brother WHITE, post, p. 495, I think the rule announced today is most ill-conceived and that it seriously and unjustifiably fetters perfectly legitimate methods of criminal law enforcement.  MR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting.  I think this case is directly controlled by Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , and I would therefore affirm the judgment.  Massiah v. United States, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 201</citedDecision> , is not in point here.  In that case a federal grand jury had indicted Massiah.  He had retained a lawyer and entered a formal plea of not guilty.  Under our system of federal justice an indictment and arraignment are followed by a trial, at which the Sixth Amendment guarantees the defendant the assistance of counsel.  [*] But Massiah was released on bail, and thereafter agents of the Federal Government deliberately elicited incriminating statements from him in the absence of his lawyer.  We held that the use of these statements against him at his trial denied him the basic protections of the Sixth Amendment guarantee.  Putting to one side the fact that the case now before us is not a federal case, the vital fact remains that this case does not involve the deliberate interrogation of a defendant after the initiation of judicial proceedings against him.

 This Court has never held that the Constitution requires the police to give any "advice" under circumstances such as these.  Supported by no stronger authority than its own rhetoric, the Court today converts a routine police investigation of an unsolved murder into a distorted analogue of a judicial trial. It imports into this investigation constitutional concepts historically applicable only after the onset of formal prosecutorial proceedings.  By doing so, I think the Court perverts those precious constitutional guarantees, and frustrates the vital interests of society in preserving the legitimate and proper function of honest and purposeful police investigation.  Like my Brother CLARK, I cannot escape the logic of my Brother WHITE's conclusions as to the extraordinary implications which emanate from the Court's opinion in *495 this case, and I share their views as to the untold and highly unfortunate impact today's decision may have upon the fair administration of criminal justice.  I can only hope we have completely misunderstood what the Court has said.  MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.  In Massiah v. United States, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 201</citedDecision> , the Court held that as of the date of the indictment the prosecution is disentitled to secure admissions from the accused.  The Court now moves that date back to the time when the prosecution begins to "focus" on the accused.  Although the opinion purports to be limited to the facts of this case, it would be naive to think that the new constitutional right announced will depend upon whether the accused has retained his own counsel, cf. Gideon v. Wainright, 372 U. S. 335 ; Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12 ; Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 , or has asked to consult with counsel in the course of interrogation.  Cf. Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U. S. 506 .  At the very least the Court holds that once the accused becomes a suspect and, presumably, is arrested, any admission made to the police thereafter is inadmissible in evidence unless the accused has waived his right to counsel.  The decision is thus another major step in the direction of the goal which the Court seemingly has in mindto bar from evidence all admissions obtained from an individual suspected of crime, whether involuntarily made or not.  It does of course put us one step "ahead" of the English judges who have had the good sense to leave the matter a discretionary one with the trial court. [*] I reject this step and *496 the invitation to go farther which the Court has now issued.

 .  Persons [denied access to counsel] are incapable of providing the challenges that are indispensable to satisfactory operation of the system.  The loss to the interests of accused individuals, occasioned by these failures, are great and apparent.  It is also clear that a situation in which persons are required to contest a serious accusation but are denied access to the tools of contest is offensive to fairness and equity.  Beyond these considerations, however, is the fact that [this situation is] detrimental to the proper functioning of the system of justice and that the loss in vitality of the adversary system, thereby occasioned, significantly endangers the basic interests of a free community." [14]  The accused may, of course, intelligently and knowingly waive his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel either at a pretrial stage or at the trial. See Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 .  But no knowing and intelligent waiver of any constitutional right can be said to have occurred under the circumstances of this case. [15]  The authority of Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , and Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 , was weakened by the subsequent decisions of this Court in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 , White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 , and Massiah v. United States, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 201</citedDecision> (as the dissenting opinion in the last-cited case recognized).  [*]  "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right .  .  .  to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence." [*]  "[I]t seems from reported cases that the judges have given up enforcing their own rules, for it is no longer the practice to exclude evidence obtained by questioning in custody.  .
