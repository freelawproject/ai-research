Id., at 315-316 .  [23] III. Under the line of cases just outlined, § 504 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act plainly constitutes a bill of attainder.  Congress undoubtedly possesses power under the Commerce Clause to enact *450 legislation designed to keep from positions affecting interstate commerce persons who may use such positions to bring about political strikes.  In § 504, however, Congress has exceeded the authority granted it by the Constitution.  The statute does not set forth a generally applicable rule decreeing that any person who commits certain acts or possesses certain characteristics (acts and characteristics which, in Congress' view, make them likely to initiate political strikes) shall not hold union office, and leave to courts and juries the job of deciding what persons have committed the specified acts or possess the specified characteristics.  Instead, it designates in no uncertain terms the persons who possess the feared characteristics and therefore cannot hold union office without incurring criminal liabilitymembers of the Communist Party.  [24] Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, <citedDecision>367 U. S. 1</citedDecision> , lends support to our conclusion.  That case involved an appeal from an order by the Control Board ordering the Communist Party to register as a "Communist-action organization," under the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 987 , 50 U. S. C. § 781 et seq. (1958 ed.).  The definition of "Communist-action organization" which the Board is to apply is set forth in § 3 of the Act: "[A]ny organization in the United States .  .  .  which (i) is substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement referred to in section 2 of this title, and (ii) operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world *451 Communist movement .  .  .  ." 64 Stat. 989 , 50 U. S. C. § 782 (1958 ed.).  A majority of the Court rejected the argument that the Act was a bill of attainder, reasoning that § 3 does not specify the persons or groups upon which the deprivations set forth in the Act are to be imposed, but instead sets forth a general definition.  Although the Board had determined in 1953 that the Communist Party was a "Communist-action organization," the Court found the statutory definition not to be so narrow as to insure that the Party would always come within it: "In this proceeding the Board has found, and the Court of Appeals has sustained its conclusion, that the Communist Party, by virtue of the activities in which it now engages, comes within the terms of the Act.  If the Party should at any time choose to abandon these activities, after it is once registered pursuant to § 7, the Act provides adequate means of relief." <citedDecision>367 U. S., at 87</citedDecision> .  The entire Court did not share the view of the majority that § 3's definition constituted rule-making rather than specification.  [25] See also Garner v. Los Angeles Board, 341 U. S. 716, 723 .  However, language incorporated in the majority opinion indicates that there was agreement on one point: by focusing upon "the crucial constitutional significance of what Congress did when it rejected the approach of outlawing the Party by name and accepted instead a statutory program regulating not enumerated organizations but designated activities," <citedDecision>367 U. S., at 84-85</citedDecision> , the majority clearly implied that if the Act had applied to the Communist Party by name, it would have been a bill of attainder: "The Act is not a bill of attainder.  It attaches not to specified organizations but to described activities *452 in which an organization may or may not engage.  .  .  .  The Subversive Activities Control Act .  .  .  requires the registration only of organizations which, after the date of the Act, are found to be under the direction, domination, or control of certain foreign powers and to operate primarily to advance certain objectives.  This finding must be made after full administrative hearing, subject to judicial review which opens the record for the reviewing court's determination whether the administrative findings as to fact are supported by the preponderance of the evidence." <citedDecision>Id., at 86-87</citedDecision> .  [26] In this case no disagreement over whether the statute in question designates a particular organization can arise, for § 504 in terms inflicts its disqualification upon members of the Communist Party.  The moment § 504 was enacted, respondent was given the choice of declining a leadership position in his union or incurring criminal liability.  *453 The Solicitor General points out that in Board of Governors v. Agnew, 329 U. S. 441 , this Court applied § 32 of the Banking Act of 1933, which provides: "No officer, director, or employee of any corporation or unincorporated association, no partner or employee of any partnership, and no individual, primarily engaged in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution, at wholesale or retail, or through syndicate participation, of stocks, bonds, or other similar securities, shall serve the same time as an officer, director, or employee of any member bank except in limited classes of cases in which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may allow such service by general regulations when in the judgment of the said Board it would not unduly influence the investment policies of such member bank or the advice it gives its customers regarding investments." [27] He suggests that for purposes of the Bill of Attainder Clause, such conflict-of-interest laws [28] are not meaningfully distinguishable from the statute before us.  We find this argument without merit.  First, we note that § 504, unlike § 32 of the Banking Act, inflicts its deprivation upon the members of a political group thought to present a threat to the national security.
**Combined Opinion**
 Like § 504, the legislation challenged in Hawker was both overinclusive and underinclusive.  Felons were not the only persons who might possess character defects making them unsuitable practitioners of medicine; and, as the Court expressly noted, not all felons would lack good moral character.  Nevertheless, the legislature was permitted to disqualify all members of the class, rather than being required to delegate to the courts the responsibility of determining the character of each individual based on all relevant facts, including the prior conviction.  The legislative findings that sustained the legislation attacked in Hawker were simply that a substantial number of felons would be likely to abuse the practice of medicine because of their bad character.  It is just such findings respecting the average propensities of a given class of persons to engage in particular conduct that the Court will not now permit under the Bill of Attainder Clause.  Though the Court makes no attempt to distinguish the Hawker -type laws it apparently would save them, see Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 96-97 (WARREN, C. J., announcing judgment), and with them the provision of the statute now before the Court which disqualifies felons from holding union office.  [3] *470 The Court apparently agrees that the Subversive Activities Control Act was not a bill of attainder with regard to the Communist Party because, as the Court pointed out in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, <citedDecision>367 U. S. 1</citedDecision> , the finding that the Party was a Communist-action organization was not made by the legislature but was made administratively, after a trial-type hearing and subject to judicial review.  But this apparently does not settle whether the statute is a bill of attainder with respect to Party members; for under today's approach, a finding about the Party and about some of its members does not cure the vice of overinclusiveness.  The Subversive Activities Control Act attaches certain disqualifications to each Party member following the administrative-judicial finding that the Party is a Communist-action organization.  Among other things, each Party member is disqualified from holding union office, almost the same disqualification as is involved here.  Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, § 5 (a) (1) (E), added by the Act of Aug. 24, 1954, § 6, 68 Stat. 777 , 50 U. S. C. § 784 (a) (1) (E) (1958 ed.).  I do not see how this and the other consequences attached to Party membership in that Act could survive examination under the principles announced today.  On the other hand, if the statutes involved in Hawker and Agnew are not bills of attainder, how can the Subversive Activities Control Act be an attainder with respect to members of the Communist Party?  In the <citedDecision>Communist Party</citedDecision> case, the Board found that the "[Party's] principal leaders and a substantial number of its members are subject to and recognize the disciplinary power of the Soviet Union and its representatives.  This evidences domination and control over [the Party] by the Soviet Union, and a purpose to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement." Modified Report of the Board, December 18, 1956, in Record in that case, *471 p. 2538.  That finding was expressly sustained by this Court. <citedDecision>367 U. S. 1, 57</citedDecision> .  Certainly, if Hawker and Agnew are to be followed at all, these nonlegislative findings establish a sufficient probability or likelihood with regard to Party membersa sufficient temptation to Party members who are also union officersto permit the legislature to disqualify Party members from union office as it did in the Subversive Activities Control Act.  And if the disqualification of Party members in the Subversive Activities Control Act is not a bill of attainder, neither is § 504.  If it is § 504's specific designation of the Communist Party and its members which concerns the Courtif the Court would have the same concern if the statute in Agnew had disqualified the members of a particular underwriting firmit seems to me that at this point this vice is no vice at all; for the Congress has provided in another statute, the Subversive Activities Control Act, for an adjudication about Communist-action organizations, the nature of the Party has now been adjudicated and an adequate probability about the future conduct of its members established to justify the disqualification which Congress has imposed.  Compare Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232, 244 (absent findings respecting nature of Communist Party at time of bar applicant's membership, membership in Party 15 years prior to application provides no rational ground for disqualification).  This, of course, is not the path the Court follows.  Section 504 is said to impose punishment on specific individuals because it has disqualified all Communist Party members without providing for a judicial determination as to each member that he will call a political strike.
**Combined Opinion**
 It was obviously reasonable for Congress to substitute § 504 for § 9 (h), and no punitive purpose may be inferred from such congressional action.  Nor can it be denied that § 504 is reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective.  In American Communications Assn. v. Douds , we held that "Congress could rationally find that the Communist Party is not like other political parties in its utilization of positions of union leadership as means by which to bring about strikes .  .  .  ," 339 U. S., at 391, and therefore Congress could rationally *478 infer that members of the Communist Party were likely to call political strikes.  See also Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, <citedDecision>367 U. S. 1, 93-94, 112</citedDecision> .  In 1956 the Subversive Activities Control Board found, after a trial-type hearing, that the Party's principal leaders and a substantial number of its members recognize the disciplinary power of the Soviet Union.  Without question the findings previously made by Congress and the Subversive Activities Control Board afforded a rational basis in 1959 for Congress to conclude that Communists were likely to call political strikes, and sufficiently more likely than others to do so that special measures could appropriately be enacted to deal with the particular threat posed.  In view of Congress' demonstrated concern in preventing future conductpolitical strikesand the reasonableness of the means adopted to that end, I cannot conclude that § 504 had a punitive purpose or that it constitutes a bill of attainder.  I intimate no opinion on the issues that the Court does not reach.  NOTES [1] 73 Stat. 536 , 29 U. S. C. § 504 (1958 ed., Supp. IV).  The section, which took effect on September 14, 1959, provides, in pertinent part: "(a) No person who is or has been a member of the Communist Party .

 ." [23]  Although it may be that underinclusiveness is a characteristic of most bills of attainder, we doubt that it is a necessary feature.  We think it clear from the Lovett opinion that § 304 would have been voided even if it could have been demonstrated that no one other than Lovett, Watson and Dodd possessed the characteristics which Congress was trying to reach.  The vice of attainder is that the legislature has decided for itself that certain persons possess certain characteristics and are therefore deserving of sanction, not that it has failed to sanction others similarly situated.  [24]  We of course take no position on whether or not members of the Communist Party are in fact likely to incite political strikes.  The point we make is rather that the Constitution forbids Congress from making such determinations.  [25]  See <citedDecision>367 U. S., at 146</citedDecision> (BLACK, J., dissenting).  [26]  "It need hardly be said that it is upon the particular evidence in a particular record that a particular defendant must be judged, and not upon the evidence in some other record or upon what may be supposed to be the tenets of the Communist Party." Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 299 .  It is argued that § 504 is not a bill of attainder because prior to its enactment there had been an administrative adjudication (by the Subversive Activities Control Board) of "the nature of the Party." Compare Hawker v. New York, 170 U. S. 189 ; DeVeau v. Braisted, 363 U. S. 144, 160 .  Even leaving aside the fact that the legislative history of § 504, see note 2, supra, indicates that Congress was acting in reliance on the findings it had made in 1947 rather than on those made by the Board in 1953, we think that this argument misses the point of the Court's opinion in the <citedDecision>Communist Party</citedDecision> case, where the Court stressed that the Subversive Activities Control Act did not name the Communist Party but rather set forth a broad definition, which would permit the Party to escape the prescribed deprivations in the event its character changed.  [27] 48 Stat. 194 , as amended, 49 Stat. 709 , 12 U. S. C. § 78 (1964 ed.).  [28]  A similar example is furnished by provisions forbidding state officers or employees from concurrently holding certain other types of positions, such as positions with the Federal Government.  See, e. g., Cal. Const., Art. IV, § 20; cf. N. Y. Const., Art. III, § 7; U. S. Const., Art I, § 6, cl. 2.  [29]  The command of the Bill of Attainder Clausethat a legislature can provide that persons possessing certain characteristics must abstain from certain activities, but must leave to other tribunals the task of deciding who possesses those characteristicsdoes not mean that a legislature cannot use a shorthand phrase to summarize the characteristics with which it is concerned.  For example, a legislature might determine that persons afflicted with a certain disease which has as one of its symptoms a susceptibility to uncontrollable seizures should not be licensed to operate dangerous machinery.  In enacting a statute to achieve this goal, the legislature could name the disease instead of listing the symptoms, for in doing so it would merely be substituting a shorthand phrase which conveys the same meaning.  [30]  To the same effect, see Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 299-300 ; Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 190 .  [31]  We rely on the "overbroadness" cases only to buttress our conclusion that § 504 cannot be rationalized on the ground that membership in the Communist Party is merely an equivalent, shorthand way of expressing those characteristics which render likely the incitement of political strikes.  We of course do not hold that overbroadness is a necessary characteristic of a bill of attainder.  [32]  The Court's opinion in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, <citedDecision>367 U. S. 1, 88</citedDecision> , also referred to the fact that the members of the class affected by the statute could extricate themselves from the class at will. However, whereas the factor of escapability was considered in Douds to be probative of whether or not the statute was punitive, in the <citedDecision>Communist Party</citedDecision> case it was considered only as one factor tending to show that the Act in question was not directed at a specific group of persons but rather set forth a generally applicable definition.  See note 26, supra. We do not read either opinion to have set up inescapability as an absolute prerequisite to a finding of attainder.  Such an absolute rule would have flown in the face of explicit precedent, Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 324 , as well as the historical background of the constitutional prohibition.  A number of ante-Constitution bills of attainder inflicted their deprivations upon named or described persons or groups, but offered them the option of avoiding the deprivations, e. g., by swearing allegiance to the existing government.  See, e. g., Del. Laws 1778, c. 29b; Mass. Acts of September 1778, c. 13; III Hamilton, History of the Republic of the United States, p. 25 (1859); see generally Note, 72 Yale L. J. 330, 339-340.  [33] American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 389 ; see note 2, supra. [34]  See Ex parte Law, 15 Fed. Cas. 3, 9-10 (No. 8126) (D. C. S. D. Ga. 1866).  Professor Chafee has pointed out that even the death penalty was often inflicted largely for preventive purposes: "There was no good middle ground between beheading and doing nothing.
