      <p class="indent">Before January, 1972, plaintiff-appellant Nancy Dukes maintained a pushcart business in the Vieux Carre of New Orleans, selling hot dogs, drinks, confections and novelties.  Subsequently the New Orleans City Council revised its ordinances, removing hot dog vendors from the list of specifically permitted pushcart enterprises in the Vieux Carre, but simultaneously allowing all licensed vendors who had continuously operated the same such business in the Quarter for eight years prior to January 1, 1972, to continue selling.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a>  Since Dukes' operation was only a year old, the effect of this revision was to eliminate her from the Vieux Carre market.  The other pushcart hot dog vendor in the Quarter, eight year veteran Lucky Dogs, Inc., was thus left with an apparently unchallengeable monopoly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p2">
      <span class="num">2</span>
      <p class="indent">Dukes brought this action under 28 U.S.C. 2201 &amp; 2202 against the City of New Orleans and its Mayor challenging the application of the revised ordinance's 'grandfather clause' to hot dog sellers in the Vieux Carre as a denial of Equal Protection and praying for an injunction and declaratory judgment.<a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">2</a>  Both Dukes and the City moved for summary judgment on the merits of the Constitutional claim.  The district court, ruling on the basis of the pleadings, answers to the plaintiff's interrogatories, and uncontested affidavits, found no genuine issue of material fact and entered judgment for the City as a matter of law.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p3">
      <span class="num">3</span>
      <p class="indent">We conclude that the court below erred in its application of Equal Protection principles, and thus reverse.  New Orleans retains ancestral entitlement to regulate business so as to maintain the charms of the Vieux Carre.  But the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution reaches beyond Canal Street, and lays its heavy hand when unjustified discrimination scars the Quarter's complexion.  The City's purpose in revising its ordinance, fair though it be, cannot support its favoring a venerable hot dog dealer with the skins of eight seasons over franks of a more recent vintage.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p4">
      <span class="num">4</span>
      <p class="indent">* There is no question of the City Council's legitimate authority generally to regulate business conducted on the public streets and sidewalks of the Vieux Carre in order to preserve the appearance and custom valued by the Quarter's residents and attractive to tourists.  The sole dispute is whether the Council has exceeded Constitutional bounds in its discriminations regarding which enterprises are to be permitted and which are to be prohibited.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p5">
      <span class="num">5</span>
      <p class="indent">The Council's classifications are not drawn upon inherently suspect lines such as race or religion.  Nor is the personal interest Dukes seeks to protect here one of such Constitutional fundamentality as to give rise to a necessity for strict judicial scrutiny in preserving its equal protection.

The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not take from the State the power to classify in the adoption of police laws, but admits of the exercise of a wide scope of discretion in that regard, and avoids what is done only when it is without any reasonable basis and therefore is purely arbitrary.  2.  A classification having some reasonable basis does not offend against that clause merely because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.  3.  When the classification in such a law is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed.  4.

      <p class="indent">The New Orleans ordinance challenged here was enacted as part of a series of measures limiting peddling in the Vieux Carre in accordance with the New Orleans City Council's apparent and reasonable belief that the presence of such distractions inhibits tourism.  The Council's asserted purpose in permitting only those vendors who had sustained their operations in the Quarter for eight years to remain was to preserve those least likely to disturb 'the unique charm and beauty that is characteristic of the Vieux Carre.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref">3</a> While we are sympathetic to New Orleans' efforts to conserve the traditional complexion of the Vieux Carre and sensitive to the difficulty of consistently aligning tradition with purely reasonable distinctions,<a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref">4</a> we nevertheless find the Council's rationale insufficient to support the discrimination imposed.</p>

      <p class="indent">We emphasize that our holding does not bar New Orleans from further legitimate attempts to conserve the Vieux Carre's unique resources.  The City Fathers might constitutionally enact any of a broad range of measures-- for example, strict regulation of the location and appearance of pushcarts-- in order to satisfy the same concerns that prompted the ordinance here examined.  But such a 'grandfather clause' as was enacted could be viable only if paternally genuine; a classificatory statute can withstand constitutional attack only if its classificatory directions are rationally guided.  Here the strictly chronological divisions were not.  We hold only that the City may not satisfy its proper goals through such arbitrary discriminations.</p>

        <p> Dukes began this action against the predecessor version of the New Orleans ordinance regulating peddling on the public streets and sidewalks of the Vieux Carre, New Orleans, La., Ordinances 4744, May 13, 1970, all amending Ordinance 838 M.C.S. ch. 1970, all amending Ordinances 838 M.C.S. ch. 46.  That version prohibited most pushcart sales, but excepted from prohibition the vending of certain items, including hot dogs.  Dukes' other sales items, drinks, confections and novelties, were not specifically excepted under the ordinance, however.  After the arrest of one of her employees on charges-- later dismissed-- of violating the existing ordinance, Dukes initiated this suit challenging the ordinance's discrimination between 'similar and comparable businesses' as a denial of Equal Protection.  After the revision of the ordinance in 1972, she amended her pleadings to attack the 'grandfather clause.'</p>
        <p>Since the current ordinance permits no pushcart foodstuff vendors in the Quarter, qua foodstuff vendors, Dukes appears no longer seriously to press her original attack on discriminations between vendors of different types of goods.  In any case, we have no difficulty in concluding that such an Equal Protection claim on Dukes' part could not withstand analysis.  See McGowan v.
