 The court noted that the revocation of hunting and fishing rights was neither discussed during the Treaty negotiations nor mentioned in the Treaty itself.  Id., at 920.  The court also rejected the State’s argument that this Court’s decision in Oregon Dept. of Fish and *188 Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985), required a different result.  124 F. 3d, at 921.  Third, the court rejected the State’s argument that, under the “equal footing doctrine,” Minnesota’s entrance into the Union extinguished any Indian treaty rights.  Id., at 926-929.  Specifically, the Court of Appeals found no evidence of congressional intent in enacting the Minnesota statehood Act to abrogate Chippewa usufructuary rights, id., at 929, and it rejected the argument that Ward v. Race Horse, <citedDecision>163 U. S. 504</citedDecision> (1896), controlled the resolution of this issue, 124 F. 3d, at 926-927.  In sum, the Court of tained their usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty with respect to land located in the State of Minnesota.  This conclusion is consistent with the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit’s earlier decision holding that the Chippewa retained those same rights with respect to the ceded land located in Wisconsin.  Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Voigt, 700 F. 2d 341 , appeal dism’d and cert, denied sub nom. Besadny v. Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, 464 U. S. 805 (1983) (Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens, JJ., would affirm).  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied a petition for rehearing and a suggestion for rehearing en banc.  The State of Minnesota, the landowners, and the counties all filed petitions for writs of certiorari, and we granted the State’s petition.  524 U. S. 915 (1998).

 Congress may abrogate Indian treaty rights, but it must clearly express its intent to do so. United States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734, 738-740 (1986); see also Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S., at 690 ; Menominee Tribe v. United States, 391 U. S. 404, 413 (1968).  There must be “clear evidence that Congress actually considered the conflict between its intended action on the one hand and Indian treaty rights on the other, and chose *203 to resolve that conflict by abrogating the treaty.” United States v. Dion, supra, at 740 .  There is no such “clear evidence” of congressional intent to abrogate the Chippewa Treaty rights here.  The relevant statute — Minnesota’s enabling Act — provides in relevant part: “[T]he State of Minnesota shall be one, and is hereby declared to be one, of the United States of America, and admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever.” Act of May 11,1858, 11 Stat. 285 .  This language, like the rest of the Act, makes no mention of Indian treaty rights; it provides no clue that Congress considered the reserved rights of the Chippewa and decided to abrogate those rights when it passed the Act.  The State concedes that the Act is silent in this regard, Brief for Petitioners 36, and the State does not point to any legislative history describing the effect of the Act on Indian treaty rights.  With no direct support for its argument, the State relies principally on this Court’s decision in Ward v. Race Horse, <citedDecision>163 U. S. 504</citedDecision> (1896).  In <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> , we held that a Treaty reserving to a Tribe “ ‘the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States, so long as game may be found thereon, and so long as peace subsists among the whites and Indians on the borders of the hunting districts’ ” terminated when Wyoming became a State in 1890.  <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 507 (quoting Art. 4 of the Treaty).  This case does not bear the weight the State places on it, however, because it has been qualified by later decisions of this Court. The first part of the holding in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> was based on the “equal footing doctrine,” the constitutional principle that all States are admitted to the Union with the sanie attributes of sovereignty (i.  e., on equal footing) as the original 13 States.  See Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  As relevant here, it prevents the Federal Government from impair *204 ing fimdamental attributes of state sovereignty when it admits new States into the Union.  Id., at 573 .  According to the <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> Court, because the treaty rights conflicted irreconcilably with state regulation of natural resources— “an essential attribute of its governmental existence,” <citedDecision>163 U. S., at 516</citedDecision> — the treaty rights were held an invalid impairment of Wyoming’s sovereignty.  Thus, those rights could not survive Wyoming’s admission to the Union on “equal footing” with the original States.  But <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> rested on a subsequent eases have made clear, an Indian tribe’s treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on state land are not irreconcilable with a State’s sovereignty over the natural resources in the State.  See, e.g., Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., supra; see also Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194 (1975).  Rather, Indian treaty rights can coexist with state management of natural resources.  Although States have important interests in regulating wildlife and natural resources within their borders, this authority is shared with the Federal Government when the Federal Government exercises one of its enumerated constitutional powers, such as treaty making.  U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  See, e. g., Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920); Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529 (1976); United States v. Winans, 198 U. S., at 382-384 ; United States v. Forty-three Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U. S. 188 (1876).  See also Menominee Tribe v. United States, supra, at 411, n. 12.

 Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath *205 Tribe, 473 U. S., at 765, n. 16 .  We have repeatedly reaffirmed state authority to impose reasonable and necessary nondiscriminatory regulations on Indian hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in the interest of conservation.  See Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 391 U. S. 392, 398 (1968); Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S., at 682 ; Antoine v. Washington, supra, at 207-208.  This “conservation necessity” standard accommodates both the State’s interest in management of its natural resources and the Chippewa’s federally guaranteed treaty rights.  Thus, because treaty rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land within state boundaries.  7 We do not understand Justice Thomas to disagree with this fundamental conclusion.  <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> rested on the premise that treaty rights are irreconcilable with state sovereignty.  It is this conclusion — the conclusion undergirding the <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> Court’s equal footing holding — that we have consistently rejected over the years.  Justice Thomas’ only disagreement is as to the scope of state regulatory authority.  His disagreement is premised on a purported distinction between “rights” and “privileges.” This Court has never used a distinction between rights and privileges *206 to justify any differences in state regulatory authority.  Moreover, as Justice Thomas acknowledges, -post, at 223 (dissenting opinion), the starting point for any analysis of these questions is the treaty language itself.  The Treaty must be interpreted in light of the parties’ intentions, with any ambiguities resolved in favor of the Indians.  Winters v. United States, 207 U. S., at 576-577 .  There is no evidence that the Chippewa understood any fine legal distinctions between rights and privileges.  Moreover, under Justice Thomas’ view of the 1837 Treaty, the guarantee of hunting, fishing, and gathering privileges was essentially an empty promise because it gave the Chippewa nothing that they did not already have.  The equal footing was in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> , however.  We also announced an alternative holding: The treaty rights at issue were not intended to survive Wyoming’s statehood.  We acknowledged that Congress, in the exercise of its authority over territorial lands, has the power to secure off-reservation usufructuary rights to Indian tribes through a treaty, and that “it would be also within the power of Congress to continue them in the State, on its admission into the Union.” <citedDecision>163 U. S., at 515</citedDecision> .  We also acknowledged that if Congress intended the rights to survive statehood, there was no need for Congress to preserve those rights explicitly in the statehood Act.  We concluded, however, that the particular rights in the Treaty at issue there— “the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States” — were not intended to survive statehood.  <citedDecision>Id., at 514</citedDecision> ; see <citedDecision>id., at 514-515</citedDecision> .  The CHIEF Justice reads <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> to a that “temporary and precarious” treaty rights, as opposed to treaty rights “which were ‘of such a nature as to imply their perpetuity,’” are not intended to survive statehood.  Post, at 219.  But the “temporary and precarious” language in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> is too broad to be useful in distinguishing rights that survive statehood from those that do not.  In Race *207 Horse, the Court concluded that the right to hunt on federal lands was temporary because Congress could terminate the right at any time by selling the lands.  <citedDecision>163 U. S., at 510</citedDecision> .  Under this line of reasoning, any right created by operation of federal law could be described as “temporary and precarious,” because Congress could eliminate the right whenever it wished.  In other words, the line suggested by <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> is simply too broad to be useful as a guide to whether treaty rights were intended to survive statehood.  <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> inquiry is whether Congress (more precisely, because this is a treaty, the Senate) intended the rights secured by the 1837 Treaty to survive statehood.  <citedDecision>Id., at 514-515</citedDecision> .  The 1837 Treaty itself defines the circumstances under which the rights would terminate: when the exercise of those rights was no longer the “pleasure of the President.” There is no suggestion in the Treaty that the President would have to conclude that the privileges should end when a State was established in the area.  Moreover, unlike the rights at issue in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> , there is no fixed termination point to the 1837 Treaty rights.  The Treaty in <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> contemplated that the rights would continue only so long as the hunting grounds remained unoccupied and owned by the United States; the happening of these conditions was “clearly contemplated” when the Treaty was ratified.  <citedDecision>Id., at 509</citedDecision> .  By contrast, the 1837 Treaty does not tie the duration of the rights to the occurrence of some clearly contemplated event.  Finally, we note that there is nothing inherent in the nature of reserved treaty rights to suggest that they can be extinguished by implication at statehood.  Treaty rights are not impliedly terminated upon statehood.  Wisconsin v. Hitchcock, 201 U. S. 202, 213-214 (1906); Johnson v. Gearlds, 234 U. S. 422, 439-440 (1914).  The <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> Court’s decision to the contrary — that Indian treaty rights were impliedly repealed by Wyoming’s statehood Act — was informed by that Court’s conclusion that the Indian treaty rights were inconsistent with state sovereignty *208 over natural resources and thus that Congress (the Senate) could not have intended the rights to survive statehood.  But as we described above, Indian treaty-based usufructu-ary rights are not inconsistent with state sovereignty over natural resources.  See supra, at 204-205.  Thus, contrary to the State’s contentions, <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> does not compel the conclusion that Minnesota’s admission to the Union extinguished Chippewa usufructuary rights guaranteed by the 1837 Treaty.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is affirmed.  It is so ordered.  The intervening comities are Aitkin, Benton, Crow 'Wing, Isanti, Kana-bec, Mille Lacs, Morrison, Pine, and Sherburne.  The intervening landowners are John W. Thompson, Jenny Thompson, Joseph N. Karpen, LeRoy Burling, Glenn E. Thompson, and Gary M. Kiedrowski.  The Wisconsin Bands are also respondents in this Court: St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewas, Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, Sokaogan Chippewa Community, and Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.  The landowners who intervened in this are and Michael Sheff These landowners, along with the six landowners who intervened in the Mille Lacs Band suit, have filed briefs in this Court in *187 support of the State.

 Post, at 215-216.  Presumably, The Chief Justice understands the 1837 Treaty to authorize the executive action in question.  In this context, however, any general presumption about the legality of executive action runs into the principle that treaty ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the Indians.  Winters v. United States, supra, at 576-577; see also County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992).  We do not think the general presumption relied upon by The Chief Justice carries the same weight when balanced against the counterpresumption specific to Indian treaties.  See also, e. g., 1846 Treaty with the Winnebago, Art. IV, 9 Stat. 878 (Government agrees to pay Winnebago Indians $40,000 “for release of hunting privileges, on the lands adjacent to their present home”); 1837 Treaty with the Sacs and Foxes, Art. 2, 7 Stat. 543 (specifically ceding “all the right to locate, for hunting or other purposes, on the land ceded in the first article of the treaty of July 15th 1830”).  The Chief Justice asserts that our criticism of <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> is inappropriate given our recent “reaf6rm[ation]” of that case in Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985).  Post, at 219.  Although we cited <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> in Klamath, we did not in so doing reaffirm the equal footing doctrine as a bar to the continuation of Indian treaty-based usufructuary rights.  Klamath did not involve the equal footing doctrine.  Rather, we cited <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> for the second part of its holding, discussed in the text, infra, at 206-208.  See 473 U. S., at 773, n. 23 .  In any event, the <citedDecision>Race Horse</citedDecision> Gourt’s reliance on the equal footing doctrine to terminate Indian treaty rights rested on foundations that were rejected by this Court within nine years of that decision.  See United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 382-384 (1905).
