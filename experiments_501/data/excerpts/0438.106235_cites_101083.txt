 .  .  .” (Emphasis supplied.) 38 Stat. 167 .  When the statute was amended in 1916, the one word “lawful” was omitted.  This revealed, we think, the obvious intent of that Congress to tax income derived from both legal and illegal sources, to remove the incongruity of having the gains of the honest laborer taxed and the gains of the dishonest immune.  Rutkin v. United States, supra, at p. 138; United States v. Sullivan, <citedDecision>274 U. S. 259, 263</citedDecision> .  Thereafter, the Court held that gains from illicit traffic in liquor are includible within “gross income.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> See also Johnson v. United States, 318 U. S. 189 ; United States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 503 .  And, the Court has pointed out, with approval, that there “has been a widespread and settled administrative and judicial recognition of the taxability of unlawful gains of many kinds,” Rutkin v. United States, supra, at p. 137.  These include protection payments made to racketeers, ransom payments paid to kidnappers, .bribes, money derived from the sale of unlawful insurance policies, graft, black market gains, funds obtained from the operation of lotteries, income from race track bookmaking and illegal prize fight pictures.  Ibid. The starting point in all cases dealing with the question of the scope of what is included in “gross income” begins with the basic premise that the purpose of Congress was “to use the full measure of its taxing power.” Helvering *219 v. Clifford, 309 U. S. 331, 334 .  And the Court has given a liberal construction to the broad phraseology of the “gross income” definition statutes in recognition of the intention of Congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted.  Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U. S. 28, 49 ; Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, 293 U. S. 84, 87-91 .  The language of § 22 (a) of the 1939 Code, “gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever,” and the more simplified language of § 61 (a) of the 1954 Code, “all income from whatever source derived,” have been held to encompass all “aeces- • sions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion.” Commissioner v. Clenshaw Glass Co., 348 U. S. 426, 431 .
**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 For reasons which need not be detailed here, petitioner effected a settlement agreement with the union on July 30, 1958, whereby, in exchange for releases fully discharging his indebtedness, he repaid to the union the sum of $13,568.50.  Accordingly, at least so far as the present record discloses, petitioner clearly realized a taxable gain in the year the releases were executed, to the extent of the difference between the amount taken and the sum restored: However, the Government brought the present action against him, not for his failure to report this gain in his 1958 return, but for his failure to report that he had incurred “income” from — actually indebtedness to — the union in each of the years 1951 through 1954.  It is true that the Government brought a criminal evasion prosecution rather than a civil deficiency proceeding against petitioner, but this can in no way alter the substantive tax law rules which alone are determinative of liability in either case. *254 There can be no doubt that until the releases were executed in 1958, petitioner and the union stood in an absolute and unconditional debtor-creditor relationship, and, under all of our relevant decisions, no taxable event could have occurred until the indebtedness was discharged for less than full repayment.  Application of the normal rule in such cases will not hinder the efficient and orderly administration of the tax laws, any more than it does in other situations involving “bargain cancellations” of indebtedness.  More importantly, it will enhance the creditor’s position by assuring that prior federal tax liens will not attach to the subject of the debt when he seeks to recover it.  • Notwithstanding all of this, The Chief Justice’s opinion concludes that there is no difference between embezzled funds and “gains” from other “illegal sources,” and it points to the fact that Congress, in its 1916 revision of the Income Tax Act, omitted the word “lawful” in describing businesses whose income was to be taxed.  The opinion then cites United States v. Sullivan, <citedDecision>274 U. S. 259</citedDecision> , in which it was held that, under the revised statute, gains from illicit traffic in liquor must be reported in gross income, since there is no “reason why the fact that a business' is unlawful should exempt it from paying the taxes that if lawful it would have to pay.” <citedDecision>Id., at 263</citedDecision> .  (Emphasis added.) That theory has been the primary basis for taxing “unlawful gains of many kinds” which the prevailing opinion today recites, such as black market profits, gambling proceeds, money derived from the sale of unlawful insurance policies, etc. 5 For, even if lawful, the gains from such activities would clearly *255 not be exempted from taxation.  However, as applied to embezzled funds, the holding in <citedDecision>Sullivan</citedDecision> contradicts, rather than supports, the Court’s conclusion today.  Obviously, embezzlement could never become “lawful” and still retain its character.  If “lawful,” it would constitute nothing more than a loan, or possibly a gift, to the “embezzler,” neither of which would produce a taxable gain to him.  There is still another obvious and important distinction between embezzlement and the varieties of illegal activity listed by the prevailing opinion — one which clearly calls for a different tax treatment.  Black marketeering, gambling, bribery, graft and like activities generally give rise to no legally enforceable right of restitution — to no debtor-creditor relationship which the law will recognize.  6 Condemned either by statute or public policy, or both, such transactions are void ab initio.  Since any consideration which may have passed is not legally recoverable, its recipient has realized a taxable gain, an “accession to income,” as clearly as if his “indebtedness” had been discharged by a full, release or by the running of a Statute of Limitations.
