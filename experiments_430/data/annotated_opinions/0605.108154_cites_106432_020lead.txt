Mr. Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court. In this case we re-examine the holding of Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, <citedDecision>370 U. S. 195</citedDecision> (1962), that the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act 1 preclude a federal district court from enjoining a strike in breach of a no-strike obligation under a collective- *238 bargaining agreement, even though that agreement contains provisions, enforceable under § 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 2 for binding arbitration of the grievance dispute concerning which the strike was called.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, considering itself bound by Sinclair, reversed the grant by the District Court for the Central District of California of petitioner’s prayer for injunctive relief.  416 F. 2d 368 (1969).  We granted certiorari.  396 U. S. 1000 (1970).  Having concluded that Sinclair was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity, we overrule that decision and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I In February 1969, at the time of the incidents that produced this litigation, petitioner and respondent were parties to a collective-bargaining agreement which provided, inter alia, that all controversies concerning its interpretation or application should be resolved by adjustment and arbitration procedures set forth therein 3 and that, during the life of the contract, there should *239 be “no cessation or stoppage of work, lock-out, picketing or boycotts .

 Furthermore, an action for damages prosecuted during or after a labor dispute would only tend to aggravate industrial strife and delay an early resolution of the difficulties between employer and union.  17 *249 Even if management is not encouraged by the unavailability of the injunction remedy to resist arbitration agreements, the fact remains that the effectiveness of such agreements would be greatly reduced if injunctive relief were withheld.  Indeed, the very purpose of arbitration procedures is to provide a mechanism for the expeditious settlement of industrial disputes without resort to strikes, lockouts, or other self-help measures.  This basic purpose is obviously largely undercut if there is no immediate, effective remedy for those very tactics that arbitration is designed to obviate.  Thus, because Sinclair, in the aftermath of Avco, casts serious doubt upon the effective enforcement of a vital element of stable labor-management relations — arbitration agreements with their attendant no-strike obligations — we conclude that Sinclair does not make a viable contribution to federal labor policy.  IV We have also determined that the dissenting opinion in Sinclair states the correct principles concerning the accommodation necessary between the seemingly absolute terms of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the policy considerations underlying § 301 (a).  18 <citedDecision>370 U. S., at 215</citedDecision> .  *250 Although we need not repeat all that was there said, a few points should be emphasized at this time.  The literal terms of § 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act must be accommodated to the subsequently enacted provisions of § 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act and the purposes of arbitration.  Statutory interpretation requires more than concentration upon isolated words; rather, consideration must be given to the total corpus of pertinent law and the policies that inspired ostensibly inconsistent provisions.  See Richards v. United States, 369 U. S. 1, 11 (1962); Mastro Plastics Corp. v. NLRB, 350 U. S. 270, 285 (1956); United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219, 235 (1941).  The Norris-LaGuardia Act was responsive to a situation totally different from that which exists today.  In the early part of this century, the federal courts generally were regarded as allies of management in its attempt to prevent the organization and strengthening of labor unions; and in this industrial struggle the injunction became a potent weapon that was wielded against the activities of labor groups.

 22 We conclude, therefore, that the unavailability of equitable relief in the arbitration context presents a serious impediment to the congressional policy favoring the voluntary establishment of a mechanism for the peaceful resolution of labor disputes, that the core purpose of the Norris-LaGuardia Act is not sacrificed by the limited use of equitable remedies to further this important policy, and consequently that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not bar the granting of injunctive relief in the circumstances of the instant case. V Our holding in the present case is a narrow one.  We do not undermine the vitality of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  We deal only with the situation in which a collective-bargaining contract contains a mandatory grievance adjustment or arbitration procedure.  Nor does it follow from what we have said that injunctive relief is appro *254 priate as a matter of course in every case of a strike over an arbitrable grievance.  The dissenting opinion in Sinclair suggested the following principles for the guidance of the district courts in determining whether to grant injunctive relief — principles that we now adopt: “A District Court entertaining an action under § 301 may not grant injunctive relief against concerted activity unless and until it decides that the case is one in which an injunction would be appropriate despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  When a strike is sought to be enjoined because it is over a grievance which both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate, the District Court may issue no injunc-tive order until it first holds that the contract does have that effect; and the employer should be ordered to arbitrate, as a condition of his obtaining an injunction against the strike.  Beyond this, the District Court must, of course, consider whether issuance of an injunction would be warranted under ordinary principles of equity — whether breaches are occurring and will continue, or have been threatened and will be committed; whether they have caused or will cause irreparable injury to the employer; and whether the employer will suffer more from the denial of an injunction than will the union from its issuance.” <citedDecision>370 U. S., at 228</citedDecision> .  (Emphasis in original.) In the present case there is no dispute that the grievance in question was subject to adjustment and arbitration under the collective-bargaining agreement and that the petitioner was ready to proceed with arbitration at the time an injunction against the strike was sought and obtained.  The District Court also concluded that, by reason of respondent’s violations of its no-strike obligation, petitioner “has suffered irreparable injury and will continue to suffer irreparable injury.” Since we now *255 overrule Sinclair, the holding of the Court of Appeals in reliance on Sinclair must be reversed.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case with directions to enter a judgment affirming the order of the District Court. It is so ordered.  Mr. Justice Marshall took no part in the decision of this case. “No court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute to prohibit any person or persons participating or interested in such dispute (as these terms are herein defined) from doing, whether singly or in concert, any of the following acts: “ (a) Ceasing or refusing to perform any work or to remain in any relation of employment; “(e) Giving publicity to the existence of, or the facts involved in, any labor dispute, whether by advertising, speaking, patrolling, or by any other method not involving fraud or violence; “ (f) Assembling peaceably to act or to organize to act in promotion of their interests in a labor dispute; “(i) Advising, urging, or otherwise causing or inducing without fraud or violence the acts heretofore specified .  .
