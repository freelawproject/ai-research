**Combined Opinion**
Counsel for petitioner protested and requested an adjournment and a public hearing where he would be permitted to call witnesses. The District Court denied the motion and thereupon adjudged petitioner guilty of criminal contempt, imposing a sentence of one year's imprisonment. [1] The Court of Appeals *164 affirmed, 334 F.2d 460 . We granted certiorari, 379 U.S. 944 . Rule 42 (a) is entitled "Summary Disposition" and reads as follows: "A criminal contempt may be punished summarily if the judge certified that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court. The order of contempt shall recite the facts and shall be signed by the judge and entered of record." Rule 42 (a) was reserved "for exceptional circumstances," Brown v. United States, <targetCase>359 U.S. 41</targetCase> , 54 (dissenting opinion), such as acts threatening the judge or disrupting a hearing or obstructing court proceedings. Ibid. We reach that conclusion in light of "the concern long demonstrated by both Congress and this Court over the possible abuse of the contempt power," ibid., and in light of the wording of the Rule. Summary contempt is for "misbehavior" ( Ex parte Terry, 128 U.S. 289 , 314) in the "actual presence of the court." Then speedy punishment may be necessary in order to achieve "summary vindication of the court's dignity and authority." Cooke v. United States, 267 U.S. 517 , 534. But swiftness was not a prerequisite of justice here.
**Combined Opinion**
If justice is to be done, a sentencing judge should know all the facts. We can imagine situations where the questions are so inconsequential to the grand jury but the *167 fear of reprisal so great that only nominal punishment, if any, is indicated. Our point is that a hearing and only a hearing will elucidate all the facts and assure a fair administration of justice. Then courts will not act on surmise or suspicion but will come to the sentencing stage of the proceeding with insight and understanding. We are concerned solely with "procedural regularity" which, as Mr. Justice Brandies said in Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U.S. 465 , 477 (dissenting), has been "a large factor" in the development of our liberty. Rule 42 (b) prescribes the "procedural regularity" for all contempts in the federal regime [5] except those unusual situations envisioned by Rule 42 (a) where instant action is necessary to protect the judicial institution itself. We overrule <targetCase>Brown</targetCase> v. United States, supra , and reverse and remand this case for proceedings under Rule 42 (b). Reversed and remanded. MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, and MR. JUSTICE WHITE join, dissenting. The issue in this case is the procedure to be followed when a witness has refused to answer questions before a grand jury after he has been ordered to do so by a district court. This issue, involving Rule 42 (a) and Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, was, as the Court says, resolved in Brown v. United States, *168 <targetCase>359 U.S. 41</targetCase> . [1] That was six years ago. Since then this Court has made no changes in Rule 42 (a) or 42 (b). [2] But today <targetCase>Brown</targetCase> is overturned, and the question it "resolved" is now answered in the opposite way. The particular question at issue here is of limited importance. But in this area the Court's duty is important, involving as it does the responsibility for clear and consistent guidance to the federal judiciary in the application of ground rules of our own making. We are not faithful to that duty, I think, when we overturn a settled construction of those rules for no better reasons than those the Court has offered in this case. [3] The limited scope of the question at issue is made clear by the present record. A grand jury in the Southern District of New York was investigating alleged violations of the Communications Act of 1934. [4] The petitioner appeared before this grand jury pursuant to a subpoena. He refused to answer a number of questions about an interstate telephone call upon the ground of possible self-incrimination. The petitioner was then *169 granted immunity from any possible self-incrimination under § 409 (1) of the Communications Act. [5] Only after giving the petitioner and his lawyer full opportunity to be heard did the District Judge rule that the petitioner was clothed with complete constitutional immunity from self-incrimination, and only then did he direct the petitioner to answer the grand jury's questions. The petitioner returned to the grand jury room and again refused to answer the questions, this time in direct and deliberate disobedience of the District Judge's order. It is common ground, I suppose, that the petitioner was then and there in contempt of court. [6] Since the petitioner's refusal to obey the judge's order did not occur within the sight and hearing of the judge, a contempt proceeding could then have been initiated only under Rule 42 (b). Such a proceeding would have been fully consonant with our decision in <targetCase>Brown</targetCase>, [7] and a judge "more intent upon punishing the witness than aiding the grand jury in its investigation might well have taken just such a course." 359 U.S. , at 50 . In such a proceeding all that would have been required to prove the contempt *170 would have been the testimony of the grand jury stenographer, and the judge could then have imposed sentence. Such a procedure is often followed. [8] Instead, however, the District Judge in this case followed the alternative procedure approved in <targetCase>Brown</targetCase>. He made one last effort to aid the grand jury in its investigation and gave the petitioner a final chance to purge himself of contempt. The petitioner and his lawyer appeared before the judge in open court. [9] After the petitioner was sworn as a witness, the judge propounded the same questions which the petitioner had refused to answer before the grand jury. The petitioner again refused to answer. At the conclusion of the questioning the judge asked, "Does anybody want to say anything further?" The only response from the petitioner's counsel, then or later, [10] was a brief renewal of his attack upon the purpose of the grand jury investigation and the scope of the immunity which had been conferred upon the petitionerlegal questions which the judge had, after a complete hearing, fully determined before he had ordered the petitioner to answer the grand jury's questions in the first place.

[3] Rule 42 (a) was described by the Advisory Committee as "substantially a restatement of existing law. Ex parte Terry, 128 U.S. 289 ; Cooke v. United States . . . ." We have confirmed this on more than one occasion, e. g., Offutt v. United States. 348 U.S. 11 , 13-14; <targetCase>Brown</targetCase> v. United States, supra , at 51. [4] Chief Justice Taft said in Cooke v. United States, supra , at 537: "Due process of law, therefore, in the prosecution of contempt, except of that committed in open court, requires that the accused should be advised of the charges and have a reasonable opportunity to meet them by way of defense or explanation. We think this includes the assistance of counsel, if requested, and the right to call witnesses to give testimony, relevant either to the issue of complete exculpation or in extenuation of the offense and in mitigation of the penalty to be imposed." [5] In more than one instance in the Southern District of New York, from which this case comes, witnesses cited for testimonial contempt before the grand jury were given hearings under Rule 42 (b). E. g., United States v. Castaldi, 338 F.2d 883 ; United States v. Tramunti, 343 F.2d 548 ; United States v. Shillitani, 345 F.2d 290 ; United States v. Pappadio, 346 F.2d 5 . There is no indication that this procedure impeded the functioning of the grand jury. [1] <targetCase>Brown</targetCase> v. United States was reaffirmed and followed in Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610 . [2] The proposed amendments to Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts, approved on September 22-23, 1965, by the Judicial Conference of the United States, make no changes in Rule 42 (a) or Rule 42 (b). [3] No argumentation or factual data are contained in the Court's opinion today which were not fully revealed in the dissenting opinion in <targetCase>Brown</targetCase>, 359 U. S., at 53-63, passim, and considered by the Court there. Nor is it suggested that the <targetCase>Brown</targetCase> rule has proved to be unclear or difficult of application. The considerations attending the overruling of <targetCase>Brown</targetCase> are quite unlike those involved in the overruling that occurred in Swift & Co., Inc. v. Wickham, ante, p. 111, where the Court changed a procedural rule which it found unworkable in actual practice. [4] 48 Stat. 1070 and 1100, 47 U.S. C . §§ 203 (c) and 501 (1964 ed. ), and 18 U.S. C . § 1952 (1964 ed.). [5] 48 Stat.

[9] The record shows that the court was "opened by proclamation." [10] Before imposing sentence, the judge gave petitioner and his counsel still another opportunity to offer any explanation they might have of the petitioner's obduracy: "The Court: I have already made my position perfectly clear, but I will say it again: I have directed you to answer these questions before the grand jury, and I have directed you to answer them here. It is my ruling that you cannot be prosecuted for any answer that you give under the circumstances of this case. Do you still refuse, Mr. Harris? "The Witness: I respectfully refuse to answer on the grounds it would tend to incriminate me. "The Court: Anything further?" [11] See, in addition to Brown v. United States, <targetCase>359 U.S. 41</targetCase> , and Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610 : Rogers v. United States, 340 U.S. 367 ; Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361 , 369; Hale v.
