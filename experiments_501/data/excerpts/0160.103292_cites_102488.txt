 1 They *110 were heard in succession and may be decided together.  In each case the Commissioner of Internal Revenue' included the trust property in the decedent’s gross estate.  In Nos. 110, 111 and 112 his determination was reversed by the Board of Tax Appeals, 34 B. T. A. 575, and the Board was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, 102 F. 2d 1 .  In No. 183, the taxpayer paid under protest, successfully sued for recovery in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and his judgment was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 103 F. 2d 834 .  In No. 399, the Commissioner was in part successful before the Board of Tax Appeals, 36 B. T. A. 669, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the Board, 104 F. 2d 1011 .  Neither here nor below does the issue turn on the un-glossed text of § 302 (c).  In its enforcement, Treasury and courts alike encounter three recent decisions of this Court, Klein v. United States, 283 U. S. 231 , Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., <citedDecision>296 U. S. 39</citedDecision> , and Becker v. St. Louis Trust Co., Ibid. 48.  Because of the difficulties which lower courts have found in applying the distinctions made by these cases and the seeming disharmony .of their results, when judged-by the controlling .purposes of the estate tax law, we brought the cases here.  All involve dispositions of property by way of trust in which the settlement provides for return or reversion of the corpus J;o the donor upon a contingency terminable at his death?  Whether the transfer made by the decedent in his lifetime is “intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death” by reason of that which he retained, is the crux of the problem.  We must put to one side questions that arise under sections of the estate tax law other than § 302 (c) — sections, that is, relating to transfers taking place at death.  Section 302 (c) deals with *111 property not technically passing at death but with interests theretofore created.  The taxable event is a transfer inter vivos.

 By bringing into the gross estate at his death that which the.  settlor gave contingently upon it, this Court fastened on the vital factor.  It refused to subordinate the plain purposes of a modern fiscal measure to^the wholly unrelated origins of the recondite learning of ancient property law. Surely the Klein decision was not intended to encourage the belief that a change merely in the phrasing of a grant would serve to create a judicially cognizable difference in the scope of § 302 (c), although the grantor retained in himself the possibility of regaining the transferred property upon precisely the same contingency.  The teaching of the Klein case is exactly the opposite.  3 In 1935 the St. Louis Trust cases came here.  A rational application of the principles of the Klein case to the situations now before us calls for scrutiny of the particulars in the St. Louis cases in order to extract their relation to the doctrine of the earlier decision.  In <citedDecision>Helvering</citedDecision> v. St. Louis Trust Co., supra, the decedent had conveyed property in trust, the income of which was to be paid to his daughter during her life, but at her death “If the grantor still be living, the Trustee shall forthwith .  .  .  transfer, pay, and deliver the entire estate to the grantor, to be his absolutely.” But “If the grantor be then not living” then the income, was to be *113 devoted to the settlor s wife if she were living, and upon the death of both daughter and wife, if he were not living, the trust property was to go to the daughter’s children, or if she left none, to the grantor’s next of kin.  In Becker v. St. Loyds Trust Co., supra, the decedent had declared himself trustee of property with the income to be accumulated or, at his discretion, to be paid over to his daughter during her life. The instrument fur-' ther provided that “If the said beneficiary should die before my death, then this trust estate shall thereupon revert to me and become mine immediately and absolutely, or ... if I should die before her death, then this property shall thereupon become hers immediately and absolutely .  .  On the authority of the Klein case the Commissioner had included in the taxable estates the gifts to which, in the St. Louis Trust cases, the grantor’s death had given definitive measure.  If the wife- had predeceased the set-tlor in the Klein case, he would have been repossessed of his property.  His wife’s interests were freed from this contingency by the husband’s prior death, and because of the effect of his death this Court swept the gift into the gross estate.  So in <citedDecision>Helvering</citedDecision> v. St. Louis Trust Co., the grantor would have become repossessed of the granted corpus had his daughter predeceased him.  But he predeceased her and by that event her interest ripened to full dominion.  The same analysis applies to the Becker case. In all three situations the result and effect were the same.  The event which gave to the beneficiaries a dominion over property which they did not have prior to the donor’s death was an act of nature outside the grantor’s “control, design or volition.” <citedDecision>296 U. S. 39, 43</citedDecision> .  But it was no more and no less “fortuitous,” so. far as the grantor’s “control, design or volition” was concerned, in the St. *114 Louis Trust cases than it was in the Klein case. In none of the three cases did the dominion over property which finally came to the beneficiary fall by virtue of the grantor’s will, except by his provision that his own death should establish such final and complete dominion.  And yet a mere difference in phrasing- the circumstance by which identic interests in property were brought into being — varying forms of words in the creation of the same worldly interests — was found sufficient to exclude the St. Louis Trust settlements from the application of the Klein doctrine.  Four members of the Court saw no difference.  They relied on the governing principle of § 302 (c) that Congress meant to include in the gross estate inter vivos gifts “which may be resorted to, as a substitute for a will, in making dispositions of property operative at death.” <citedDecision>296 U. S. at 46</citedDecision> .  To effectuate this purpose practical considerations applicable to taxation and not the “niceties of the art of conveyancing” were their touchstone.  “Having in mind,” said the dissenters, “the purpose of the statute and the breadth of its language it would seem to be of no consequence what particular conveyancers’ device — what particular string — the decedent selected to hold in suspense the ultimate disposition of his property until the .moment of his death.  In determining whether a taxable transfer becomes complete, only at death we look to substance, not to form .  .  .  However we label the device it is .  but a means by which the gift, is rendered incomplete until the donor’s death.” <citedDecision>296 U. S. at 47</citedDecision> .  For the majority in the St. Louis Trust Company cases, these practicalities had less significance than the formal categories of property law. The grantor’s death, the majority said, in <citedDecision>Helvering</citedDecision> v. St. Louis Trust Co., “simply put an end to what, at best, wás a mere possibility óf a reverter by extinguishing it — that is to say, by converting what was merely possible into an utter impossibility.” <citedDecision>296 U. S. *11539, 43</citedDecision> .  This was precisely the mode of argument which had been rejected in Klein v. United States, supra. We are now asked to accept all three decisions as constituting a .coherent body of law, and to apply their distinctions to the trusts before us.  In Nos. 110, 111 and 112 (Helvering v. Hallock) the decedent in 1919 created a trust under a separation agreement, giving 'the income to his wife for life, with this further provision: “If and when Anne Lamson Hallock shall die then and in such event .  .  .  the within trust shall terminate and said Trustee shall .  .

In both of these cases limitations which would probably have been “contingent” at “common law” were held to be “vested” under the New York statutory rule.  Cf. Commissioner v. Schwarz, 74 F. 2d 712 ; Flora M. Bonney, 29 B. T. A. 45.  Cf. Lyeth v. Hoey, 305 U. S. 188, 194 .  See Paul, The Effect on Federal Taxation of Local Rules of Property in Selected Studies in Federal Taxation (2nd Series), pp. 23-28; Developments in the Law—Taxation, 47 Harv. L. Rev. 1209 , 1238-41; Note, 49 Harv. L. Rev. 462 .  See, for example, Fearne, Contingent Remainders, (4th Am. Ed.), pp. 3-241; Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities (2nd Ed.), pp. 99-118; VII Holdsworth, History of English Law, 81 et seq.; 1 Simes, Future Interests, §§ 64-96.  The confusion apt to be engendered by judicial forays into this field is well illustrated by the use of the term “possibility of reverter” by the majority in <citedDecision>Helvering</citedDecision> v. St. Louis Union Trust Co. “A possibility of reverter” is traditionally defined as the interest remaining in a grantor who has conveyed a' determinable fee.  The definition has not been thought to have any relation to the reversionary* interest of a grantor who has transferred either a vested or contingent remainder in fee.  See Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities (2nd Ed.), §§ 13-51.  We are not unmindful of amendments to the estate tax law to which other decisions of this Court gave rise.  Thus by § 805 of the Revenue Act of 1936, c. 690, 49 Stat. 1648 , Congress undid the construction which this Court gave the estate tax law in another connection by a decision rendered on the same day as were the St. Louis Trust cases. Cf. White v. Poor, 296 U. S. 98 .  This case arose under § 302 (d) and not § 302 (c).  But, in any event, the fact of Congressional action in dealing with one problem while silent on the different problems created by the St. Louis Trust cases, does not imply controlling acceptance by Congress of those cases. By the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, c. 454, 46 Stat. 1516 , Congress displaced the construction which this Court put upon § 302 (c) in those cases wherein it was held that the reservation by a decedent of a life estate in property conveyed inter vivos, did not constitute a sufficient postponement of the remainder to bring it into the grantor’s gross estate.

*123 Mr. Justice Roberts, dissenting.  There is certainly a distinction in fact between the transaction considered in Klein v. United States, 283 U. S. 231 , and those under review in Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., <citedDecision>296 U. S. 39</citedDecision> , and Becker v. St. Louis Uniont Trust Co., 296 U. S. 48 .  The courts, the Board of Tax Appeals, and the Treasury have found no difficulty in observing the distinction in specific cases. I believe it is one of substance, not merely of terminology, and not dependent on the niceties of conveyancing or recondite doctrines of ancient property law. But if I am wrong in this, I still think the judgments in Nos. 110-112, and 183 should be affirmed and that in 399 should be reversed.  The rule of interpretation adopted in the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases should now be followed for two reasons: First, that rule was indicated by decisions of this court as the one applicable in the circumstances here disclosed, as early as 1927; was progressively developed and applied by the Board of Tax Appeals, the lower federal courts, and this court, up to the decision of McCormick v. Burnet, 283 U. S. 784 , in 1931; and has since been followed by those tribunals in not less than fifty cases. It ought not to be set aside after such a history.  Secondly.  The rule was not contrary to any treasury regulation; was, indeed, in accord with such regulations as there were on the subject; .was subsequently embodied in a specific regulation, and, with this background, Congress has three times reenacted the law without amending § 302 (c) in respect of the matter here in issue.  The settled doctrine, that reenactment of a statute so construed, without alteration, renders such construction a part of the statute itself, should not be ignored but observed.  *124 1.

 There is no tax imposed by the statute because there is no transfer any more than there would be in the case of a similar life estate given A by his grandmother.  (This is May v. Heiner, 281 U. S. 238 .) If, on the other hand, A creates an estate for years or for life in B, retaining the remaining beneficial interest .in the property for himself, and, whether by the terms of the grant, or by the terms of A’s will, or under the intestate law, that remainder passes to someone else at his death, such passage renders the transfer taxable.  (This is Klein v. United States, supra.) If what A does is to transfer his property irrevocably, with provision that it shall be.  enjoyed successively by various persons for life and then go absolutely to a named person, but that if he, A, shall outlive that person, the property shall come back to him, and A dies in the lifetime of the person in question, A has merely" lost the chance that the beneficial ownership of the property may revert to him.  That chance cannot pass under his will or under the intestate laws.  As there is no transfer which can become effective at his death by the shifting of any interest from him, no tax is imposed, (This is McCormick v. Burnet, supra, and <citedDecision>Helvering</citedDecision> v. St. Louis Union Trust Company, supra.) 2.  These governing principles were indicated as early as 1927 4 and were thereafter developed, in application to specific cases, in a consistent line of authorities.  In May v. Heiner, supra, it was held that a transfer in trust under which the income was payable to.  the trans-feror’s husband for his life and, after his death, to the transferor during her life, with remainder to her children, was not subject to tax as a'transfer intended to; take effect *127 in possession or enjoyment at or after death.  .
