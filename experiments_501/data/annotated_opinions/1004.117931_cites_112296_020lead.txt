 See n. 2, supra. Moreover, as both the Ninth and the Second Circuits observed, Congress has not seen fit to repudiate, limit, or refine the exception despite its somewhat murky borders and its obvious tension with the text of the statute as construed in Bramblett .  On the other hand, it is also true that Congress has not seen fit to overturn the holding in Bramblett , despite the fact that the opinions endorsing the judicial function exception evidence a good deal of respectful skepticism about the correctness of that decision.  V With the foregoing considerations in mind, we now turn to the difficult stare decisis question that this case presents.  It is, of course, wise judicial policy to adhere to rules announced in earlier eases.  As Justice Cardozo reminded us: “The labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in every case, and one could not lay one’s own course of bricks on the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone before him.” B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921).  Adherence to precedent also serves an indispensable institutional role within the Federal Judiciary.  Stare decisis is “a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon ‘an arbitrary discretion.’” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, <citedDecision>491 U. S. 164, 172</citedDecision> (1989) (quoting The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton)).  See also Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 854-855 (1992) (joint opinion of O’Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).  Respect for precedent is strongest “in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court’s interpretation *712 of its legislation.” Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977).  11 In this case, these considerations point in two conflicting directions.  On one hand, they counsel adherence to the construction of § 1001 adopted in Bramblett ; on the other, they argue in favor of retaining the body of law that has cut back on the breadth of Bramblett in Circuits from coast to coast.  It would be difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously.  For if the word “department” encompasses the Judiciary, as Bramblett stated, 348 U. S., at 509 , the judicial function exception cannot be squared with the text of the statute.

 Conversely, Bramblett could not stand if we preserved the thrust of the judicial function exception — i.  e., if we interpreted 18 U. S. C. § 1001 so that it did not reach conduct occurring in federal-court proceedings.  Again, although Bramblett involved a false representation to an office within the Legislative Branch, the decision lumped all three branches together in one and the same breath.  See 384 U. S., at 509 (“department” in § 1001 “was meant to describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Government”).  *713 We think the text of § 1001 forecloses any argument that we should simply ratify the body of cases adopting the judicial function exception.  We are, however, persuaded that the clarity of that text justifies a reconsideration of Bramblett .  12 Although such a reconsideration is appropriate only in the rarest circumstances, we believe this case permits it because of a highly unusual “intervening development of the law,” see Patterson, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 173</citedDecision> , and because of the absence of significant reliance interests in adhering to Bramblett .  The “intervening development” is, of course, the judicial function exception.  In a virtually unbroken line of cases, respected federal judges have interpreted § 1001 so narrowly that it has had only a limited application within the Judicial Branch.  See nn. 2 and 10, supra. This interpretation has roots both deep and broad in the lower courts.  Although the judicial function exception has not been adopted by this Court, our review of Bramblett supports the conclusion that the cases endorsing the exception almost certainly reflect the intent of Congress.  It is thus fair to characterize the judicial function exception as a “competing legal doctrin[ej,” Patterson, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 173</citedDecision> , that can lay a legitimate claim to respect as a settled body of law. Overruling Bramblett would preserve the essence of this doctrine and would, to that extent, promote stability in the law. 13 *714 Stare decisis has special force when legislators or citizens “have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.” Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm’n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991); see also Casey, 505 U. S., at 854-856 (joint opinion of O’Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).  Here, however, the reliance interests at stake in adhering to Bramblett are notably modest.  In view of the extensive array of statutes that already exist to penalize false statements within the Judicial Branch, see, e. g., 18 U. S. C. § 1621 (perjury); § 1623 (false declarations before grand jury or court); §1503 (obstruction of justice); §287 (false claims against the United States), we doubt that prosecutors have relied on § 1001 as an important means of deterring and punishing litigation-related misconduct.  14 But we need not speculate, for we have direct evidence on this point.  The United States Attorneys’ Manual states quite plainly that “[pjrosecutions should not be brought under 18 U. S. C. § 1001 for false statements submitted in federal court proceedings”; it instead directs prosecutors to proceed under the perjury or obstruction of justice statutes.  U. S. Dept, of *715 Justice, United States Attorneys’ Manual ¶ 9-69.267 (1992).  Clearer evidence of nonreliance can scarcely be imagined.

 The penalties were changed in the Act of May 30,1908, 35 Stat. 555 , and the statute was recodified as § 35 of the Criminal Code in the Act of Mar. 4,1909, 35 Stat. 1095 .  “ ‘Does a defendant “cover up ... a material fact” when he pleads not guilty?’ ‘Does an attorney “cover up” when he moves to exclude hearsay testimony he knows to be true, or when he makes a summation on behalf of a client he knows to be guilty?’ ” Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d 234, 237 (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963).  Some 17 years before Masterpol , the Second Circuit restricted the application of § 1001 in a slightly different manner.  In United States v. D'Amato, 507 F. 2d 26 (1974), the court overturned a § 1001 conviction arising out of a false affidavit submitted in the course of a private civil lawsuit.  Based upon a review of relevant case law and legislative history, the court concluded that § 1001 did not apply “where the Government is involved only by way of a court deciding a matter in which the Government or its agencies are not involved.” Id., at 28.  Accord, United States v. London, 714 F. 2d 1558, 1561-1562 (CA11 1983).  See also, e. g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 172-173</citedDecision> (stare decisis has “special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done”); Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986) (noting “the strong presumption of continued validity that adheres in the judicial interpretation of a statute”); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 189 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring) (declining to overturn “a line of [statutory] authority which I firmly believe to have been incorrectly decided”); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 286 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting) (“Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.  This is commonly true, even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation”) (citation omitted).  Because the fate of the judicial function exception is tied so closely to Bramblett , we find no merit in the Government’s suggestion that a reconsideration of the validity of that decision is not fairly included in the question on which we granted certiorari.  See generally Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379-383 (1995).  The dissent criticizes us for according respect to a body of law developed in the lower courts, arguing that our decision will “induce” federal judges on the courts of appeals to “ignore” precedents from this Court and thereby invite chaos in the judicial system.  Post, at 721.  We would have thought it self-evident that the lower courts must adhere to our precedents.
