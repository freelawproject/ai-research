<p id="b253-5">The evidence obtained from this accused’s stomach would be admissible in the-majority of states where the question has been raised.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So far as the reported cases reveal, the only states which would probably exclude the evidence would be Arkansas, Iowa, Michigan, and Missouri.<page-number citation-index="1" label="178">*178</page-number><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yet the Court now says that the rulé which the majority of the states have fashioned violates the “decencies of civilized conduct.” To that I cannot agree. It is a rule formulated by responsible courts with judges as sensitive as we áre to the proper. standards for law administration.</p>
<p id="b254-4">As an original matter it.might be debatable whether the provision in the»Fifth Amendment that no person “shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself” serves the ends of justice. Not all civilized legal procedures recognize it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the choice was made by the Framers, a choice which sets a standard for legál trials in this country. The Framers made it <page-number citation-index="1" label="179">*179</page-number>a standard of due process for prosecutions by the Federal Government. If it is a requirement of due process for a trial in the federal courthouse, it is impossible for me to say it is not a requirement of due process for a trial in the state courthouse. That was the issue recently surveyed in <em>Adamson </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U. S. 46. The Court rejected the view that compelled testimony should be excluded and held in substance that the accused in a state trial can be forced to testify against himself. I disagree. Of course an accused can be compelled to be present at the trial, to stand, to sit, to turn this way or that, and to try on a cap or a coat. See <em>Holt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>218 U. S. 245, 252-253. But I think that words taken from his lips, capsules taken from his stomach, blood taken from his veins are all inadmissible provided they are taken from him without his consent. 'They are inadmissible because of the • command of the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p id="b255-5">That is an unequivocal, definite and workable rule of evidence for state and federal courts. But we cannot in fairness free the state courts from that command and yet excoriate them for flouting the “decencies of civilized conduct” when they admit the evidence. That is to make the rule turn not on the Constitution but on the idiosyncrasies of the judges who sit here.</p>
<p id="b255-6">. The damage of the view sponsored by the Court in this case may not be conspicuous here. But it is part of the same philosophy that produced <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>316 U. S. 455, denying counsel to an accused in a state trial against the command of the Sixth Amendment, and <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>338 U. S. 25, allowing evidence obtained as a result of a search and seizure that is illegal under the Fourth Amendment to be introduced in a state trial. It is part of the process of erosion of civil rights of the citizen in recent years,</p>
