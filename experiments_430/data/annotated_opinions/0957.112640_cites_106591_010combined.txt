**Combined Opinion**
 Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107 (1982), held that the standard applies even in cases in which the alleged constitutional error impaired the truthfinding function of the trial. Respondents had failed to object at trial to jury instructions that placed on them the burden of proving self-defense.  Ohio's contemporaneous objection rule barred respondents' claim on appeal that the burden should have been on the State.  We held that this independent and adequate state ground barred federal habeas as well, absent a showing of cause and prejudice.  Recognizing that the writ of habeas corpus "is a bulwark against convictions that violate fundamental fairness," we *748 also acknowledged that "the Great Writ entails significant costs." Id., at 126 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The most significant of these is the cost to finality in criminal litigation that federal collateral review of state convictions entails: "As Justice Harlan once observed, `[b]oth the individual criminal defendant and society have an interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation, and that attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community.' Sanders v. United States, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 1, 24-25</citedDecision> (1963) (dissenting opinion)." <citedDecision>Id., at 127</citedDecision> .  Moreover, "[f]ederal intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate both the States' sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights." <citedDecision>Id., at 128</citedDecision> .  These costs are particularly high, we explained, when a state prisoner, through a procedural default, prevents adjudication of his constitutional claims in state court. Because these costs do not depend on the type of claim the prisoner raised, we reaffirmed that a state procedural default of any federal claim will bar federal habeas unless the petitioner demonstrates cause and actual prejudice.  <citedDecision>Id., at 129</citedDecision> .  We also explained in Engle that the cause and prejudice standard will be met in those cases where review of a state prisoner's claim is necessary to correct "a fundamental miscarriage of justice." Id., at 135 .  See also Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 496 (1986) ("[W]here a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default").  In Carrier , we applied the cause and prejudice standard to a petitioner's failure to raise a particular claim in his state *749 court appeal.  Again, we emphasized the important interests served by state procedural rules at every stage of the judicial process and the harm to the States that results when federal courts ignore these rules: "A State's procedural rules serve vital purposes at trial, on appeal, and on state collateral attack.  .
