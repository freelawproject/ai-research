**Dissenting Opinion**
 The weight of the harassment factor does not warrant elevating collateral-estoppel principles in criminal trials to the level of an “ingredient” of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  True harassment deserves serious consideration because of the strain of the new trial. But society has an urgent interest in protecting the public from criminal acts and we ought not endorse any concepts that put a premium on aggravated criminal conduct in multiple crimes committed at the same time.  Arguably if Ashe had made a defense solely by alibi, that he was in Vietnam at the time and offered evidence of Army records etc., one might reasonably say the jury decided what the Court today says it probably decided.  On this record however, such an analysis is baseless.  See ante, at 439 n. 3.  For a criticism of the collateral-estoppel doctrine because of the “guesswork” necessary to apply it to general criminal verdicts, see Note, 75 Yale L. J. 262, 285 (1965).  Hoag v.
