 See, for example, United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S. 81 .  7 Cranch, at 34 .  And see United States v. Coolidge, 1 Wheat. 415 .  United States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259, 263 .  327 U.

The same reasoning can be found in our opinion in Alison v. United States, 344 U. S. 167, 169-170 .  <citedDecision>127 F. 2d, at 574</citedDecision> .  E. g., Commissioner v. Smith, 324 U. S. 177 (compensation through exercise of stock option), led to § 218 of the Revenue Act of 1950, adding § 130A to the 1939 Code; Commissioner v. Tower, 327 U. S. 280 ; Lusthaus v. Commissioner, 327 U. S. 293 ; and Commissioner v. Culbertson, 337 U. S. 733 (family partnerships), led to § 340 of the Revenue Act of 1951, adding § 191 to the 1939 Code; United States v. Silk, 331 U. S. 704 (“employees” for purpose of Social Security employment tax), led to the Joint Resolution of June 14, 1948, c. 468, 62 Stat. 438 , amending several sections of the 1939 Code; Commissioner v. Estate of Church, 335 U. S. 632 , and Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner, 335 U. S. 701 (estate tax), led to the Act of October 25, 1949, § 7, 63 Stat. 891 , 894, amending § 811 (c) of the 1939 Code; Wilmette Park Dist. v. Campbell, 338 U. S. 411 (amusement tax), led to § 402 of the Revenue Act of 1951, adding § 1701 (d) to the 1939 Code; Commissioner v. Korell, 339 U. S. 619 (amortization of bond premium), led to § 217 of the Revenue Act of 1950, amending § 125 (b) (1) of the 1939 Code. 46 Stat. 1516 ; see 74 Cong. Rec. 7078-7079, 7198-7199.  H. R. 8854, 86th Cong., 1st Sess.; H. R. 312, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. “To explain the cause of non-action by Congress when Congress itself sheds no light is to venture into speculative unrealities.  Congress may not have had.  its attention directed to an undesirable decision; and there is no indication that as to the St. Louis Trust cases it had, even by any bill that found its way into a committee pigeon-hole.” 309 U. S. 106, 119-120 .  (Emphasis supplied.) “Thus the affirmative action taken by Congress in 1942 negatives any inference that otherwise might be drawn from its silence when it reenacted the oath in 1940.” 328 U. S. 61, 70 .

 Brief for the United States in Opposition to Petition for Certiorari, Rutkin v. United States, 343 U. S. 130, pp. 13-14 .  The full sentence in the Court of Appeals opinion from which the Government quoted was: “So he [Rutkin] did receive the money with a ‘semblance of a bona fide claim of right’ as the embezzler had not in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Wilcox, supra, 327 U. S. at page 408, 66 S. Ct. at page 549.” United States v. Rutkin, 189 F. 2d 431, 435 .  This factual distinction was clearly emphasized in the Court’s opinion in Rutkin: “[Rutkin] induced Reinfeld to consent to pay the money by creating a fear in Reinfeld that harm otherwise would come to him and to-his family.  Reinfeld thereupon delivered his own money to petitioner.  Petitioner’s control over the cash so received was such that, in the absence of Reinfeld’s unlikely repudiation of the transaction and demand for the money’s return, petitioner could enjoy its use as fully as though his title to it were unassailable.” Rutkin v. United States, 343 U. S. 130, 136-137 .  (Emphasis supplied.) The analogy between the borrower and the embezzler was lucidly analyzed by Judge Sibley in McKnight v. Commissioner, <citedDecision>127 F. 2d 572, 573-574</citedDecision> .  The several cases relied on by the Court do not, in our judgment, justify imposing a tax upon embezzled money.  Corliss v. Bowers, 281 U. S. 376 , involved income accumulating in a trust fund belonging to the taxpayer and over which he retained control.  North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet, 286 U. S. 417 ; United States v. Lewis, 340 U. S. 590 ; and Healy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 , were cases in which the taxpayer had asserted a bona fide, though mistaken, claim of right.  In North American Oil, the taxpayer not only had a bona fide claim to the money taxed, but there had been an adjudication that he was entitled to it, and there was only the tenuous possibility that a competing claimant might later upset that adjudication.  The Lewis and Healy cases involved a tax on payments made and received as a result of mutual mistake, and it was held that the administration of the tax laws on an annual basis need not be upset for the convenience of those who caused the mistaken payments to be made and reported as income.  By contrast, the victims do not cause embezzlements, and the Government is not misled or inconvenienced under Wilcox because the embezzler is always fully aware that the embezzled funds are not rightfully his and presumably will not report otherwise.
