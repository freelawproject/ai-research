**Dissenting Opinion**
 See, e. g., H. Cross, G. Kennedy, J. Mell, & W. Zimmermann, Employer Hiring Practices: Differential Treatment of Hispanic and Anglo Job Seekers 42 (Urban Institute Report 90-4,1990) (e. g., Anglo applicants sent out by investigators received 52% more job offers than matched Hispanics); M. Turner, M. Fix, & R. Struyk, Opportunities Denied, Opportunities Diminished: Racial Discrimination in Hiring xi (Urban Institute Report 91-9, 1991) (“In one out of five audits, the white applicant was able to advance farther through the hiring process than his black counterpart.  In one out of eight audits, the white was offered a job although his equally qualified black partner was not.  In contrast, black auditors advanced farther than their white counterparts only 7 percent of the time, and received job offers while their white partners did not in 5 percent of the audits.”).  See, e.g., Ayres, Fair Driving: Gender and Race Discrimination in Retail Car Negotiations, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 817 , 821-822, 819, 828 (1991) (“blacks and women simply cannot buy the same car for the same price as can white men using identical bargaining strategies”; the final offers given white female testers reflected 40 percent higher markups than those given white male testers; final offer markups for black male testers were twice as high, and for black female testers three times as high as for white male testers).  See, e.g., A Common Destiny: Blacks and American Society 50 (G. Jaynes & R. Williams eds. 1989) (“[I]n many metropolitan areas one-quarter to one-half of all [housing] inquiries by blacks are met by clearly *274 discriminatory responses.”); M. Turner, R. Struyk, & J. Yinger, U. S. Dept, of Housing and Urban Development, Housing Discrimination Study: Synthesis i-vii (Sept. 1991) (1989 audit study of housing searches in 25 metropolitan areas; over half of African-American and Hispanic testers seeking to rent or buy experienced some form of unfavorable treatment compared to paired white testers); Leahy, Are Racial Factors Important for the Allocation of Mortgage Money?, 44 Am. J. Econ. & Soc. 185,193 (1985) (controlling for socioeconomic factors, and concluding that “even when neighborhoods appear to be similar on every major mortgage-lending criterion except race, mortgage-lending outcomes are still unequal”).  See, e. g., Associated General Contractors v. Coalition for Economic Equity, 960 F. 2d 1401, 1415 (CA9 1991) (detailing examples in San Francisco).  Cf. Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., <citedDecision>476 U. S. 267, 318</citedDecision> (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 222-223 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  On the differences between laws designed to benefit a historically disfavored group and laws designed to burden such a group, see, e. g., Carter, When Victims Happen To Be Black, 97 Yale L. J. 420, 433-434 (1988) (“[WJhatever the source of racism, to count it the same as racialism, to say that two centuries of struggle for the most basic of civil rights have been mostly about freedom from racial categorization rather than freedom from racial oppression, is to trivialize the lives and deaths of those who have suffered under racism.  To pretend ... that the issue presented in Bakke was the same as the issue in Brown is to pretend that history never happened and that the present doesn’t exist.”).
