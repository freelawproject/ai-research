 A public official sued in his official capacity for carrying out official policy would be a “person” for purposes of injunctive relief, but a non-“person” in an action for damages.  The Court’s holding avoids this difficulty.  See ante, at 690 n. 55.  Finally, if we continued to adhere to a rule of absolute municipal immunity under § 1983, we could not long avoid the question whether “we should, by analogy to our decision in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), imply a cause of action directly from the Fourteenth Amendment which would not be subject to the limitations contained in § 1983 .  .  .  .” Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, <citedDecision>429 U. S. 274, 278</citedDecision> (1977).  One aspect of that inquiry would be whether there are any “special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,” Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 396 (1971), such as an “explicit congressional declaration *713 that persons injured by a [municipality] may not recover money damages .  .  .  , but must instead be remitted to another remedy, equally effective in the view of Congress,” id., at 397 .  In light of the Court’s persuasive re-examination in today’s decision of the 1871 debates, I would have difficulty inferring from § 1983 “an explicit congressional declaration” against municipal liability for the implementation of official policies in violation of the Constitution.  Rather than consti-tutionalize a cause of action against local government that Congress intended to create in 1871, the better course is to confess error and set the record straight, as the Court does today.

 But the Court’s recognition of its power to invalidate legislation not in conformity with constitutional command was essential to its judgment in Marbury .  And on numerous subsequent occasions, the Court has been required to apply the full breadth of the Marbury holding.  In Monroe , on the other hand, the Court’s rationale was broader than necessary to meet the contentions of the parties and to decide the case in a principled manner.  The language in Monroe cannot be dismissed as dicta, but we may take account of the fact that the Court simply was not confronted with the implications of holding § 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies.  It is an appreciation of those implications that has prompted today’s re-examination of the legislative history of the 1871 measure.  In Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1, 16 (1976), we reaffirmed Monroe , but petitioner did not contest the proposition that counties were excluded from the reach of § 1983 under Monroe , and the question before us concerned the scope of pendent-party jurisdiction with respect to a state-law claim.  Similarly, the parties in Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, <citedDecision>429 U. S. 274</citedDecision> (1977), did not seek a re-examination of our ruling in Monroe .  To the extent that the complaints in those cases asserted claims against the individual defendants in their personal capacity, as well as official capacity, the court would have had authority to award the relief requested.  There is no suggestion in the opinions, however, that the practices at issue were anything other than official, duly authorized policies.  Mr. Justice RehNquist’s dissent makes a strong argument that “[s]ince Monroe , municipalities have had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers’ failure to predict this Court’s recognition of new constitutional rights.” Post, at 717.  But it reasonably may be assumed that most municipalities already indemnify officials sued for conduct within the scope of their authority, a policy that furthers the important interest of attracting and retaining competent officers, board members, and employees.  In any event, the possibility of a qualified immunity, as to which the Court reserves decision, may remove some of the harshness of liability for good-faith failure to predict the often uncertain course of constitutional adjudication.
