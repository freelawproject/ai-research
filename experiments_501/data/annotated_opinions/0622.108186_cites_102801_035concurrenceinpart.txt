**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 In both cases, more patently in Williams than in Baldwin, the history of jury trial practice in both the state and federal systems has been indiscriminately jumbled together as opposed to the point of departure having been taken from the language in which the federal guarantee is expressed and the historical precedent that brings it to life. The consequence of this inverted approach to interpreting the Sixth Amendment results, fortuitously, 4 in Baldwin in a Sixth Amendment rule that would be reached under the correct approach, given the “incorporationist” philosophy of Duncan , but, unhappily, imposes it on the one jurisdiction in the country that has seen fit to do otherwise; and in Williams results in a Sixth Amendment rule that could only be reached by standing the constitutional dialectic on its head.  A To the extent that the prevailing opinion premises its conclusions in the Baldwin case on federal precedent and the common-law practice, I agree that the federal right to *120 jury trial attaches where an offense is punishable by as much as six months’ imprisonment.  I think this follows both from the breadth of the language of the Sixth Amendment, which provides for a jury in “all criminal prosecutions,” and the evidence of historical practice.  In this regard I believe that contemporary usage in the States is of little, if any, significance.  5 For if exceptions are to be created out of the all-embracing language of the Sixth Amendment they should only be those that are anchored in history.  It is to the distinction between “petty” and “serious” offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.  See District of Columbia v. Clawans, <citedDecision>300 U. S. 617</citedDecision> (1937); Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65 (1904); Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 552 (1888).  Since the conventional, if not immutable practice at common law appears to have been to provide juries for offenses punishable by fines of more than £100 or sentences to hard labor of more than six months in prison, see Frankfurter & Corcoran, Petty Federal Offenses and the Constitutional Guaranty of Trial by Jury, 39 Harv. L. Rev. 917 (1926), 6 I think it *121 appropriate to draw the line at six months in federal cases, 7 although, for reasons to follow, I would not encumber the States by this requirement.  8 *122 B In Williams the Court strangely does an about-face.  Rather than bind the States by the hitherto undeviating and unquestioned federal practice of 12-member juries, the Court holds, based on a poll of state practice, that a six-man jury satisfies the guarantee of a trial by jury in a federal criminal system and consequently carries over to the States.  This is a constitutional renvoi.  With all respect, I consider that before today it would have been unthinkable to suggest that the Sixth Amendment’s right to a trial by jury is satisfied by a jury of six, or less, as is left open by the Court’s opinion in Williams, or by less than a unanimous verdict, a question also reserved in today’s decision.  1.

 But stare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence *119 to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).  While all States except New York provide for jury trials for crimes carrying sentences of six months or more, there is a good deal of diversity as to the number of jurors and the stage at which the right to jury trial attaches.  After concluding, relying on this Court’s prior decisions, that the jury trial required by the Sixth Amendment applies only to “serious” as opposed to “petty” offenses, the opinion defines those terms by perfunctory reference to history and a survey of prevailing state rules.  See No. 188, ante, at 71-72.  “The range and severity of punishment in summary trials has been defined by limiting jurisdiction to the imposition of fines up to a hundred pounds and sentences with hard labor up to six months.” Id., at 934.  The practice in the Colonies was not uniform but it is apparent that the line was drawn at six months in most instances.  See <citedDecision>District of Columbia</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clawans, supra,</citedDecision> at 626 nn. 2, 3.  While this Court has said that the most significant index to the seriousness of an offense is the degree of penalty that attaches, see Frank v. United States, 395 U. S. 147, 148 (1969); <citedDecision>District of Columbia</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clawans, supra,</citedDecision> it should be recalled that this is not alone determinative and that the “apportioned punishment was both a consequence of the minor quality of the misconduct and an index of the community’s moral judgment upon it.” Frankfurter & Corcoran, supra, at 980.  In <citedDecision>Clawans</citedDecision> the Court held the severity of punishment was not determinative when the offense by its own nature is not considered grave.  <citedDecision>300 U. S., at 625</citedDecision> ; see also Callan v. Wilson, supra, at 556 ; Schick v. United States, supra, where this Court noted that the “nature” of the offense and the severity of punishment are two distinct considerations.  Cf. the House debate in 1930 over a bill to provide for a trial before federal magistrates for crimes of a petty nature, 72 Cong. Rec. 9991-9994; see also H. R. Rep. No. 1699, 71st Cong., 2d Sess. (1930) (minority views); Comments, American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Trial by Jury 21 (Approved Draft 1968); Comment, The Petty Offense Category and Trial by Jury, 40 Yale L. J. 1303 (1931).  I would reserve the question as to whether a jury would be required in a federal ease for a particular offense not punishable by more than six months in prison.  Nor do I think it offends the Equal Protection Clause for New York not to provide juries to hear offenses punishable by six months in New York City but to have such a provision for trials elsewhere in the State.  In Salsburg v. Maryland, 346 U. S. 545 (1954), and Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U. S. 22 (1880), this Court upheld the right of a State to adapt procedures to the differing requirements of territorial subdivisions.  In Salsburg the Court quoted and reaffirmed the principles set forth in Missouri: “ '[T]here is nothing in the Constitution to prevent any State from adopting any system of laws or judicature it sees fit for all or any part of its territory.  If the State of New York, for example, should see fit to adopt the civil law and its method of procedure for New York City and the surrounding counties, and the common law and its method of procedure for the rest of the State, there is nothing in the *122 Constitution of the United States to prevent its doing so.’ ” 346 U. S., at 551.
