  The Pennsylvania Gas Company is a Pennsylvania corporation which supplies natural gas to the inhabitants of the city of Jamestown. Its gas fields and wells are in Pennsylvania, and its gas is conveyed to Jamestown through pipe lines. About forty-five miles of fine are in Pennsylvania and about five in New York. It has a branch office in Jamestown, and its mains and pipes are in the city’s streets. Formerly its rates for gas were thirty cents a thousand. Recently it attempted to raise its rates to thirty-five cents, and filed a schedule with the public service commission accordingly. A citizen of Jamestown, alleging that the new rates were exorbitant, lodged a complaint with the commission.

  The gas company was directed to answer the complaint. It filed with the commission a demurrer to the jurisdiction which the commission overruled. Thereupon the company sued out a writ of prohibition. Its petition alleges that the attempted regulation of its rates is an unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce. The writ was granted at Special Term, and vacated at the Appellate Division. An appeal to this court followed.

  (1) We think the petitioner’s business is interstate-commerce. There is no doubt that the transportation of oil or gas from state to state through the medium of pipe lines is commerce between the states

The transactions would then be similar to those common in the oil business. We do not now determine the rule that should govern them. It is enough to hold that where there is in substance no storage, but merely transmission for immediate or practically immediate use, direct from seller to consumer, • interstate commerce does not end till the gas has reached its goal. That, by the fair intendment of the petition, is the business conducted by this petitioner. It is not important that consumers do not signify in advance the precise amount that they will need. If their wants are approximately known, and the gas is transmitted not to be held, but to be used, so that any storage that results is merely casual and incidental, the transaction is to be treated as single and continuous. We must then say, in the language of Holmes, J., in
  <em>

All charges made or demanded by any such gas corporation, electrical corporation or municipality for gas, electricity or any service rendered or to be rendered, shall be just and reasonable and not more than allowed by law or by order of the commission having jurisdiction.

  There is a twofold distinction. The regulation there condemned was one that affected telegraph companies in a field already occupied by the statutes of the nation (Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended June 18, 1910), and it imposed a new duty instead of enforcing an old one (247 U. S. at p. 114).
 </p>
<p id="b455-5">
  In thus holding, we do not forget that the state, in the. exercise of its police power, must not introduce diversity and conflict in spheres where there is need of uniformity and harmony. That is the reason why, irrespective of any occupation of the field by Congress, it may not fix the rates of interstate transportation. It may not do this, even though it confines its action to that part of the interstate journey within its own limits. The law in that respect has been undoubted since the decision in
  <em>
   Wabash, St. L. &amp; P. R. Co.
  </em>
  v.
  <em>
   Ill.
  </em>
  (<span class="citation" data-id="91716"><a href="/opinion/91716/wabash-st-louis-pacific-railway-co-v-illinois/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wabash, St. Louis &amp; Pacific Railway Co. v. Illinois">118 U. S. 557</a></span>). A statute of Illinois prescribed that there should be no greater charge for a short haul than for a long one. In condemning the statute, the court emphasized the need of uniform regulation. If each state prescribed different rates for different portions of the trip, the result would be chaos. Again in the
  <em>

  case

Kentucky">154 U. S. 204</a></span>), the decision had a like basis. A bridge lay between two states. One state attempted to fix a charge. The court said that if one state could fix one charge; the other could fix another; and again the result would be chaos. On the other hand, the question was left open whether the two states, in default of action by Congress, might establish a joint •

  tariff (154 U. S. at p. 222). These cases are taken as typical of many others. The principle back of them has been often stated.

   “
  </em>
  As to those subjects which require a general system or uniformity of regulation the power of Congress is exclusive ”
  <em>
   (Minn. Rate Cases, supra,
  </em>
  at p. 399). As to “ other matters, admitting of diversity of treatment according to the special requirements of local conditions,” there is a reserved power in the states, subject, in its exercise, to the overriding power of the nation.
  <em>
   “
  </em>
  Inaction of Congress upon these subjects of a local nature or operation, unlike its inaction upon matters affecting all the states and requiring uniformity of regulation,” is not a denial, but a concession of the power of the vicinage

A central authority must reconcile the clashing action of localities. What is within the police power of one state is equally in such circumstances within the police power of its neighbor. One cannot freely exercise its will without affecting at the same time the like freedom of another. In the phrase of Hobbes, there is need of

  <span class="citation no-link">6 Wis. 639</span>). The service is due to the state from which the privilege proceeds. Until Congress shall intervene, it is, therefore, the police power of New York that controls the sale of gas to consumers in New York. There is no division of the power between New York and Pennsylvania. There is no more a division of power than when we regulate our fees for wharfage or our tolls for artificial waterways. In these matters, protection of our own inhabitants is a duty that is ours and no one else’s. The power may be displaced; but until displaced, it is undivided. Here, then, is the decisive distinction between the regulation of the price of gas and that of rates of transportation. There is no room for conflict of authority, for clashing regulations. The statute has a sphere of operation that is not national, but local

  It is idle to speak of the need of uniformity of action by states of equal competence when there is only one state whose action is involved. But even within the state, diversity rather than uniformity is exacted by the conditions of the business. Rates adequate in one city are inadequate in another. The local needs are best known to local agencies of government. No central authority, acting for the nation as a whole, will readily discern them.

  The case comes, then, to this: We have a sale of a

  single commodity. We have a pre-existing duty to sell it at fair rates. We have a transaction where conflicting regulations by the states are impossible, for the public duties regulated are fulfilled in one state only. We have a statute which declares a duty that would exist without it, and establishes a new agency of government to insure obedience. The silence of Congress cannot be interpreted as a declaration that public service corporations, serving the needs of the locality, may charge anything they please
