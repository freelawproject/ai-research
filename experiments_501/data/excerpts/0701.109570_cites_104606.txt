 §732.5 (1950 and 1976 Supp.) (repealed in 1967); Minn. Stat. Ann. § 340.82 (1957) (repealed in 1969); Neb. Rev. Stat. 53-181 (1944) (repealed in 1955); Utah Code Ann. §76-34 ^1 (1953 and 1975 Supp.) (repealed in 1955).  Other statutes and constitutional provisions proscribed the introduction of alcoholic beverages onto Indian reservations.  See, e. g., Act of June 10, 1910, §2, 36 Stat. 558 ; Ariz. Const., Art. XX, §3; N. M. Const., Art. XXI, §8; Okla. Const., Art. 1, §7.  While Indian-oriented provisions were the most common, state alcohol beverage prohibitions also have been directed at other groups, notably German, Italian, and Catholic immigrants.  See, e. g., J. Higham, Strangers in the Land 25, 267-268, 295 (1975).  The repeal of most of these laws signals society’s perception of the unfairness and questionable constitutionality of singling out groups to bear the brunt of alcohol regulation.  Insofar as Goesaert v. Cleary, <citedDecision>335 U. S. 464</citedDecision> (1948), may be inconsistent, that decision is disapproved.  Undoubtedly reflecting the view that Goesaert’s equal protection analysis no longer obtains, the District Court made no reference to that decision in upholding Oklahoma’s-statute.  Similarly, the opinions of the federal and state courts cited earlier in the text invalidating gender lines with respect to alcohol regulation uniformly disparaged the contemporary vitality of <citedDecision>Goesaert</citedDecision> .  As noted in Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S., at 17-18 , the Oklahoma Legislature is free to redefine any cutoff age for the purchase and sale of 3.2% beer that it may choose, provided that the redefinition operates in a gender-neutral fashion.
