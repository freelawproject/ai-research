 Silverman v. United States.” To support its new interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, which in effect amounts to a rewriting of the language, the Court's opinion concludes that “the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been .  .  .  eroded by our subsequent decisions .  .  .  .” But the only cases cited as accomplishing this “eroding” are Silverman v. United States, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 505</citedDecision> , and Warden v. Hayden, 337 U. S. 294 .  Neither of these cases “eroded” Olmstead or Goldman.  Silverman is an interesting choice since there the Court expressly refused to re-examine the rationale of Olmstead or Goldman although such a reexamination was strenuously urged upon the Court by the petitioners’ counsel.  Also it is significant that in <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> , as the Court described it, “the eavesdropping was accomplished by means of an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied by the petitioners,” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 509</citedDecision> , thus calling into play the supervisory exclusionary rule of evidence.  As I have pointed out above, where there is an unauthorized intrusion, this Court has rejected admission of evidence obtained regardless of whether there has been an unconstitutional search and seizure.  The majority’s decision here relies heavily on the statement in the opinion that the Court “need not pause to consider whether or not there was a technical trespass under the local property law relating to party walls.” (At 511.) Yet this statement should not becloud the fact that time and again the opinion emphasizes that there has been an unauthorized intrusion: “For a fair reading of the record in this case shows that the eavesdropping was accomplished by means of an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied by the petitioners.” (At 509, emphasis added.) “Eavesdropping *371 accomplished by means of such a physical intrusion is beyond the pale of even those decisions .  .  .

“[DJecision here ... is based upon the reality of an actual intrusion .  .  .  .” (At 512, emphasis added.) “We find no occasion to re-examine Goldman here, but we decline to go beyond it, by even a fraction of an inch.” (At 512, emphasis added.) As if this were not enough, Justices Clark and Whittaker concurred with the following statement: “In view of the determination by the majority that the unauthorized physical penetration into petitioners’ premises constituted sufficient trespass to remove this case from the coverage of earlier decisions, we feel obliged to join in the Court’s opinion.” (At 513, emphasis added.) As I made clear in my dissent in Berger , the Court in <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> held the evidence should be excluded by virtue of the exclusionary rule and “I would not have agreed with the Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> .  .  .  had I thought that the result depended on finding a violation of the Fourth Amendment .  .  .  .” 383 U. S., at 79-80.

 But there is not.” (Dissenting opinion, at 508.) I made clear in that dissent my fear of the dangers involved when this Court uses the “broad, abstract and ambiguous concept” of “privacy” as a “comprehensive substitute for the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against 'unreasonable searches and seizures.’ ” (See generally dissenting opinion, at 507-527.) The Fourth Amendment protects privacy only to the extent that it prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures of “persons, houses, papers, and effects.” No general right is created by the Amendment so as to give this Court the unlimited power to hold unconstitutional everything which affects privacy.  Certainly the Framers, well acquainted as they were with the excesses of governmental power, did not intend to grant this Court such omnipotent lawmaking authority as that.  The history of governments proves that it is dangerous to freedom to repose such powers in courts.  For these reasons I respectfully dissent.  The first paragraph of my Brother Harlan's concurring opinion is susceptible of the interpretation, although probably not intended, that this Court “has long held” eavesdropping to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment and therefore “presumptively unreasonable in the absence of a search warrant.” There is no reference to any long line of cases, but simply a citation to <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> , and several cases following it, to establish this historical proposition.  In the first place, as I have indicated in this opinion, I do not read <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> as holding any such thing; and in the second place, <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> was decided in 1961.  Thus, whatever it held, it cannot be said it “has [been] long held.” I think my Brother Harlan recognizes this later in his opinion when he admits that the Court must now overrule Olmstead and Goldman .  In having to overrule these cases in order to establish the holding the Court adopts today, it becomes clear that the Court is promulgating new doctrine instead of merely following what it “has long held.” This is emphasized by my Brother Harlan's claim that it is “bad physics” to adhere to Goldman .  Such an assertion simply illustrates the propensity of some members of the Court to rely on their limited understanding of modern scientific subjects in order to fit the Constitution to the times and give its language a meaning that it will not tolerate.
