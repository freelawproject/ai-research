<p id="b279-9">With reference to the lineup point involved in this case I cannot, for the life of me, see why a lineup is not a critical stage of the prosecution. Identification of the suspect — a’prerequisite to establishment of guilt — occurs at this stage, and with <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966), on the books, the requirement of the presence of counsel arises, unless waived by the suspect. I dissented in <em>Miranda </em>but I am bound by it now, as we all are. <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U. S. 757 (1966), precludes petitioner’s claim of self-incrimination. I therefore join the opinion of the Court.</p>
