 Thereafter, the employer did not make effective the proposed changes in the workday and workweek *135 before the new agreement became effective on July 23, 1972.  Although all but a very few employees complied with the Union’s resolution against acceptance of overtime work during the negotiations, the employer did not discipline, or attempt to discipline, any employee for refusing L> work overtime.  Instead, while negotiations continued, the employer filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board that the Union’s resolution violated § 8 (b) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452 , as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (b)(3).  The Regional Director dismissed the charge on the ground that the “policy prohibiting overtime work by its member employees .  .  .  does not appear to be in violation of the Act” and therefore was not conduct cognizable by the Board under NLRB v. Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S. 477</citedDecision> (1960).  However, the employer also filed a complaint before the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission charging that the refusal to work overtime constituted an unfair labor practice under state law. The Union filed a motion before the Commission to dismiss the complaint for want of “jurisdiction over the subject matter” in that jurisdiction over “the activity of the [Union] complained of [is] pre-empted by” the National Labor Relations Act.  App. 11.  The motion was denied and the Commission adopted the Conclusion of Law of its Examiner that “the concerted refusal to work overtime, is not an activity which is arguably protected under Section 7 or arguably prohibited under Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and .  .  .  , therefore, the .

 In a proceeding under the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act, the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board issued an order forbidding the union and its members to engage in concerted efforts to interfere with production by those methods.  This Court did not inquire whether Congress meant that such methods should be reserved to the union “to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.” Rather, because these methods were “neither made a right under federal law nor a violation of it” the Court held that there “was no basis for denying to Wisconsin the power, in governing her internal affairs, to regulate” such conduct.  Id., at 265 .  However, the Briggs-Stratton holding that state power is not pre-empted as to peaceful conduct neither protected by § 7 nor prohibited by § 8 of the federal Act, a holding premised on the statement that “[t]his conduct is governable by the State or it is entirely ungoverned,” 336 U. S., at 254 , was undercut by subsequent decisions of this Court. For the Court soon recognized that a particular activity might be “protected” by federal law not only when it fell within § 7, but also when it was an activity that Congress intended to be “unrestricted by any governmental power to regulate” because it was among the permissible “economic weapons in reserve, .  .  .  actual exercise [of which] on occasion by the parties, is part and parcel of the system that the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts have recognized.” NLRB v. Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 488-489</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  “[T]he legislative purpose may .  .  .  dictate that certain activity 'neither protected nor prohibited’ be deemed privileged against state regulation.” Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181, 187 (1965).  *142 II Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra,</citedDecision> involved a charge of a refusal by the union to bargain in good faith in violation of § 8 (b) (3) of the Act.  The charge was based on union activities that occurred during good-faith bargaining over the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement.  During the negotiations, the union directed concerted on-the-job activities by its members of a harassing nature designed to interfere with the conduct of the employer’s business, for the avowed purpose of putting economic pressure on the employer to accede to the union’s bargaining demands.  The harassing activities, all peaceful, by the member insurance agents included refusal for a time to solicit new business, and refusal (after the writing of new business was resumed) to comply with the employer insurance company’s reporting procedures; refusal to participate in a company campaign to solicit new business; reporting late at district offices the days the agents were scheduled to attend them; refusing to perform customary duties at the office, instead engaging there in “sit-in-mornings,” “doing what comes naturally,” and leaving at noon as a group; absenting themselves from special business conferences arranged by the company; picketing and distributing leaflets outside the various offices of the company on specified days and hours as directed by the union; distributing leaflets each day to policyholders and others and soliciting policyholders’ signatures on petitions directed to the company; and presenting the signed policyholders’ petitions to the company at its home office while simultaneously engaging in mass demonstrations there.  <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 480-481</citedDecision> .  We held that such tactics would not support a finding by the NLRB that the union had failed to bargain in good faith as required by § 8 (b) (3) and rejected the per se rule applied by the Board that use of “economically harassing activities” alone sufficed to prove a vio *143 lation of that section.  The Court assumed “that the activities in question here were not 'protected’ under § 7 of the Act,” <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 483</citedDecision> n. 6, but held that the per se rule was beyond the authority of the NLRB to apply.  “The scope of § 8(b)(3) and the limitations on Board power which were the design of § 8 (d) are exceeded, we hold, by inferring a lack of good faith not from any deficiencies of the union’s performance at the bargaining table by reason of its attempted use of economic pressure, but solely and simply because tactics designed to exert economic pressure were employed during the course of the good-faith negotiations.  Thus the Board in the guise of determining good or bad faith in negotiations could regulate what economic weapons a party might summon to its aid.  And if the Board could regulate the choice of economic weapons that may be used as part of collective bargaining, it would be in a position to exercise considerable influence upon the substantive terms on which the parties contract.  As the parties’ own devices became more limited, the Government might have to enter even more directly into the negotiation of collective agreements.  Our labor policy is not presently erected on a foundation of government control of the results of negotiations.  See S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2.

 The Court had earlier recognized in pre-emption cases that Congress meant to leave some activities unregulated and to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.  Garner v. Teamsters Union , in finding pre-empted state power to restrict peaceful recognitional picketing, said: “The detailed prescription of a procedure for restraint of specified types of picketing would seem to imply that other picketing is to be free of other methods and sources of restraint.  For the policy of the national Labor Management Relations Act is not to condemn all picketing but only that ascertained by its prescribed processes to fall within its prohibitions.  Otherwise, it is implicit in the Act that the public interest is served by freedom of labor to use the weapon of picketing.  For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act prohibits.” 346 U. S., at 499-500 .  5 Moreover, San Diego Unions v. Garmon expressly recognized that “the Board may decide that an activity is neither protected nor prohibited, and thereby raise the *145 question whether such activity may be regulated by the States.” 359 U. S., at 245 .  6 It is true, however, that many decisions fleshing out the concept of activities “protected” because Congress meant them to be “unrestricted by any governmental power to regulate,” Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> , involved review of per se NLRB rules applied in the regulation of the bargaining process.  E. g., NLRB v. American National Ins. Co., 343 U. S. 395 (1952); NLRB v. Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra;</citedDecision> NLRB v. Drivers Local Union, 362 U. S. 274 (1960); NLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S. 278 (1965); American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300 (1965); cf. NLRB v. Truck Drivers Union, 353 U. S. 87 (1957); H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S. 99 (1970); Florida Power & Light v. Electrical Workers, 417 U. S. 790 , 805 n. 16 (1974).  But the analysis of Garner and <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> came full bloom in the pre-emption area in Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 (1964), which held pre-empted the application *146 of state law to award damages for peaceful union secondary picketing.  Although Morton involved conduct neither “protected nor prohibited” by § 7 or § 8 of the NLRA, we recognized the necessity of an inquiry whether “ ‘Congress occupied this field and closed it to state regulation.’ ” 377 U. S., at 258 .  Central to Morton’s analysis was the observation that “ [i] n selecting which forms of economic pressure should be prohibited .  .  .  , Congress struck the ‘balance .  .

 Ill There is simply no question that the Act’s processes would be frustrated in the instant case were the State’s ruling permitted to stand.  The employer in this case invoked the Wisconsin law because it was unable to overcome the Union tactic with its own economic self-help means.  9 Although it did employ economic weapons putting pressure on the Union when it terminated the pre *149 vious agreement, supra, at 134, it apparently lacked sufficient economic strength to secure its bargaining demands under “the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy,” Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S., at 260 .  10 But the economic weakness of the affected party cannot justify state aid contrary to federal law for, as we have developed, “the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is not a grudging exception [under] .  .  .  the [federal] Act; it is part and parcel of the process of collective bargaining.” Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 495</citedDecision> .  The state action in this case is not filling “a regulatory void which Congress plainly assumed would not exist,” Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S., at 196 (Brennan, J., concurring).  Rather, it is clear beyond question that Wisconsin “[entered] into the substantive aspects of the bargaining process to an extent Congress has not countenanced.” NLRB v. <citedDecision>Insurance Agents, supra, at 498</citedDecision> .  Our decisions hold that Congress meant that these activities, whether of employer or employees, were not to be regulable by States any more than by the NLRB, for neither States nor the Board is “afforded flexibility in picking and choosing which economic devices of labor and management shall be branded as unlawful.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Rather, both are without authority to attempt to “intro- *150 cluce some standard of properly ‘balanced’ bargaining power,” <citedDecision>id., at 497</citedDecision> (footnote omitted), or to define “what economic sanctions might be permitted negotiating parties in an ‘ideal’ or ‘balanced’ state of collective bargaining.” <citedDecision>Id., at 500</citedDecision> .  11 To sanction state regulation of such economic pressure deemed by the federal Act “desir-abl[y] .  .  .  left for the free play of contending economic forces, ... is not merely [to fill] a gap [by] outlawing] what federal law fails to outlaw; it is denying one party to an economic contest a weapon that Congress meant him to have available.” Lesnick, Preemption Reconsidered : The Apparent Reaffirmation of Garmon , 72 Col. L. Rev. 469, 478 (1972).  12 Accordingly, such regulation by *151 the State is impermissible because it “ 'stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' ” Hill v. Florida, 325 U. S. 538, 542 (1945).  IV There remains the question of the continuing vitality of Briggs-Stratton.  San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S., at 245 n. 4, made clear that the Briggs-Stratton approach to pre-emption is “no longer of general application.” See also Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra,</citedDecision> at 493 n. 23.  We hold today that the ruling of Briggs-Stratton, permitting state regulation of partial strike activities such as are involved in this case is likewise “no longer of general application.” 13 *152 Briggs-Stratton assumed “management .  .  .  would be disabled from any kind of self-help to cope with these coercive tactics of the union” and could not “take any steps to resist or combat them without incurring the sanctions of the Act.” 336 U. S., at 264 .  But as <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> held, where the union activity complained of is “protected,” not because it is within § 7, but only because it is an activity Congress meant to leave unregulated, “the employer could have discharged or taken other appropriate disciplinary action against the employees participating.” <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 493</citedDecision> .  Moreover, even were the activity presented in the instant case “protected” activity within the meaning of § 7, 14 eco *153 nomic weapons were available to counter the Union's refusal to work overtime, e. g., a lockout, American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300 (1965), and the hiring of permanent replacements under NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Tel. Co., 304 U. S. 333 (1938).  See Prince Lithograph Co., 205 N. L. R. B. 110, 115 (1973); Cox, The Right to Engage in Concerted Activities, 26 Ind. L. J. 319, 339 (1951); Getman, The Protection of Economic Pressure by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 115 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1195 , 1236 (1967).  Our decisions since Briggs-Stratton have made it abundantly clear that state attempts to influence the substantive terms of collective-bargaining agreements are as inconsistent with the federal regulatory scheme as are such attempts by the NLRB: “Since the federal law operates here, in an area where its authority is paramount, to leave the parties free, the inconsistent application of state law is necessarily outside the power of the State.” Teamsters Union v. Oliver, 358 U. S. 283, 296 (1959).  And indubitably regulation, whether federal or State, of “the choice of economic weapons that may be used as part of collective bargaining [exerts] considerable influence upon the substantive terms on which the parties contract.” NLRB v. Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 490</citedDecision> .  The availability or not of economic weapons that federal law leaves the parties free to use cannot “depend upon the forum in which the [opponent] presses its claims.” Howard Johnson Co. v. Hotel Employees, 417 U. S. 249, 256 (1974).  15 *154 Although we are not unmindful of the demands of stare decisis and the “important policy considerations militat[ing] in favor of continuity and predictability in the law,” Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235, 240 (1970), Briggs-Stratton “stands as a significant departure from our .  .  .  emphasis upon the congressional policy” central to the statutory scheme it has enacted, and since our later decisions make plain that Briggs-Stratton “does not further but rather frustrates realization of an important goal of our national labor policy,” Boys Markets, supra, at 241 , Briggs-Stratton is expressly overruled.  Its authority “has been ‘so restricted by our later decisions’ .

 .  and of contrary authority.” United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 26 (1960).  V This survey of the extent to which federal labor policy and the federal .Act have pre-empted state regulatory authority to police the use by employees and employers of peaceful methods of putting economic pressure upon one another compels the conclusion that the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court must be reversed.  It is not contended, and on the record could not be contended, that the Union policy against overtime work was enforced by violence or threats of intimidation or injury to property.  Workers simply left the plant at the end of their workshift and refused to volunteer for or accept overtime or Saturday work.  In sustaining the order of the Wisconsin Commission, the Wisconsin Supreme Court relied on Briggs-Stratton as dispositive against the Union’s claim of pre-emption, 67 Wis. 2d, at 19 , 226 *155 N. W. 2d, at 206 .  The court held further that the refusal to work overtime was neither arguably protected under § 7 nor arguably prohibited under § 8 of the federal Act, id., at 23-24, 226 N. W. 2d, at 208 , an analysis which, as developed, is largely inapplicable to the circumstances of this case. NLRB v. <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> was distinguished on the ground that that case dealt only with NLRB power “to regulate .  .  .  strike tactics” and left such “regulation ... to the states.” 67 Wis. 2d, at 22 , 226 N. W. 2d, at 207 .  Finally, the court rejected the Union’s argument relying on Teamsters Union v. Morton that the refusal to work overtime was affirmatively “permitted” under federal law, stating: “Congress has not 'focused upon’ partial .  .  .

 .  .  [T]he truth of the matter is that at the present statutory stage of our national labor relations policy, the two factors — -necessity for good-faith bargaining between parties, and the availability of economic pressure devices to each to make the other party incline to agree on one’s terms — exist side by side.  .  .  .  Doubtless one factor influences the other; there may be less need to apply economic pressure if the areas of controversy have been defined through discussion; and at the same time, negotiation positions are apt to be weak or strong in accordance with the degree of economic power the parties possess.” Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 488-489</citedDecision> .  In this case we need not and do not disturb the holding of Briggs-Stratton, later remarked in Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 494</citedDecision> n. 23, that § 13 of the NLRA, 29 U. S. C. § 163 , which guarantees *151 a qualified right to strike, is not an independent limitation on state power apart from its context in the structure of the Act.  Nor need we determine the vitality of the implication in Briggs-Stratton, also remarked in Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra,</citedDecision> at 494 n. 23, that § 501 (2) of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the NLRA, 29 TJ. S. C. §142(2), is not to be considered in connection with §13, but rather is only an aid to construction of § 8 (b)(4), 29 U. S. C. §158 (b)(4), of the NLRA.  We do note, however, that in determining the sense of the entire structure of the federal law respecting the use of economic pressure and the economic weapons assumed by Congress to be available to the parties, it is not insignificant that § 501 (2) in defining the term “strike” refers to the use of “any concerted slow-down or other concerted interruption of operations by employees.” “It is hardly conceivable that such a word as ‘strike’ could have been defined in these statutes without congressional realization of the obvious scope of its application.” Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra,</citedDecision> at 511 n. 6 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  To the extent, however, that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, was premised on the Court’s concern in that case with “evidence of considerable injury to property and intimidation of other employees by threats,” 336 U. S., at 253 , that decision remains vital as an unexceptional instance of our consistent recognition of the power of the States to regulate conduct physically injuring or threatening injury to persons or property.  See supra, at 136, and n. 2.  The assumption, arguendo, in <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> that the union activities involved were “unprotected” by § 7 reflected the fact that those activities included some bearing at least a resemblance to the “sit-down” strike held unprotected in NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., 306 U. S. 240 (1939), and the "disloyal” activities held unprotected in NLRB v. Electrical Workers, 346 U. S. 464 (1953).  See Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 492-494</citedDecision> .  The concerted refusal to work overtime presented in this case, however, is wholly free of such overtones.  It may be that case-by-case adjudication by the federal Board will ultimately result in the conclusion that some partial strike activities such as the concerted ban on overtime in the instant case, when unaccompanied by other aspects of conduct such as those present in <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> or those in Briggs-Stratton (overtones of threats and violence, 336 U. S., at 250 n. 8, and a refusal to specify bargaining demands, id., at 249 ; see also <citedDecision>Insurance Agents, supra, at 487</citedDecision> , and n. 13), are “protected” activities within the meaning of § 7, although not so protected as to preclude the use of available countervailing economic weapons by the employer.  See Prince Lithograph Co., 205 N. L. R. B. 110 (1973).  Compare ibid.; Dow Chemical Co., 152 N. L. R. B. 1150 (1965), with Decision, Inc., 166 N. L. R. B. 464, 479 (1967); John S. Swift Co., 124 N. L. R. B. 394 (1959).  See also Polytech, Inc., 195 N. L. R. B. 695, 696 (1972).  The Board in those cases placed emphasis on whether the decision to work overtime was voluntary with the individual in deciding whether a concerted refusal to work overtime is protected by *153 § 7.  The parties in the instant case dispute the volitional nature of overtime prior to the concerted ban.  In light of our disposition of the case we have no occasion to address the issue.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Powell, with whom The Chief Justice joins, concurring. The Court correctly identifies the critical inquiry with respect to pre-emption as whether “the exercise of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act’s processes.” Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S. 369, 380 (1969). See ante, at 147-148. This is equally true whether the self-help activities *156 are those of the employer or the Union. I agree with the Court that the Wisconsin law, as applied in this case, is pre-empted since it directly curtails the self-help capability of the Union and its members, resulting in a significant shift in the balance of free economic bargaining power struck by Congress. I write to make clear my understanding that the Court’s opinion does not, however, preclude the States from enforcing, in the context of a labor dispute, “neutral” state statutes or rules of decision: state laws that are not directed toward altering the bargaining positions of employers or unions but which may have an incidental effect on relative bargaining strength. Except where Congress has specifically provided otherwise, the States generally should remain free to enforce, for example, their law of torts or of contracts, and other laws reflecting neutral public policy. * See Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1337 , 1355-1356 (1972). With this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court. State laws should not be regarded as neutral if they reflect an accommodation of the special interests of employers, unions, or the public in areas such as employee self-organization, labor disputes, or collective bargaining.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Stevens, with whom Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Rehnquist join, dissenting.  If the partial strike activity in this case were protected, or even arguably protected, by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, the Court’s conclusion would be supported by San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 .  But in Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 336 U. S. 245 (Briggs-Strait on), the Court rejected the argument that comparable activity was protected by § 7.  And as I understand the Court’s holding today, it as *157 sumes that this activity remains unprotected.  1 Moreover, if such activity were prohibited, or arguably prohibited, by § 8 of the Act, the Court's conclusion would also be supported by Garmon .  But ever since NLRB v. Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S. 477</citedDecision> , it has been clear that this activity is not even arguably prohibited.  If Congress had focused on the problems presented by partial strike activity, and had enacted special legislation dealing with this subject matter, but left the form of the activity disclosed by this record unregulated, the Court's conclusion would be supported by Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 .  But this is not such a case. Despite the numerous statements in the Court’s opinion about Congress’ intent to leave partial strike activity wholly unregulated, I have found no legislative expression of any such intent nor any evidence that Congress has scrutinized such activity.  2 *158 If this Court had previously held that the no-man’s land in which conduct is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited by federal law is nevertheless preempted by an unexpressed legislative intent, I would follow such a holding.  But none of the cases reviewed in the Court’s opinion so holds.  3 Ever since 1949, when Briggs-Stratton was decided, the rule has been that partial strike activity within that area may be regulated by the States.  If adherence to the rule of Briggs-Stratton would per *159 mit the States substantially to disrupt the balance Congress has struck between union and employer, I would readily join in overruling it.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 I recognize that there is some ambiguity in the Court’s discussion, ante, at 152-153, which first implies that the employer may take any appropriate disciplinary action, including discharge, since the union activity is unprotected by § 7, and then immediately casts doubt on this assurance to the employer by indicating that some economic weapons may be used in reprisal even if the activity is protected.  The ambiguity of the Court’s rationale is inconsistent with its assumption that the employer is wholly free to use economic self-help without fear of committing an unfair labor practice.  In all events, while I recognize that I may be misreading the Court’s opinion, I assume that its holding rests on the predicate that the concerted refusal to work overtime in this case, like the partial strike activity in Briggs-Stratton, is unprotected by § 7.  A scholar who has criticized Briggs-Stratton has observed: “The omission of a federal prohibition against 'quickie’ strikes certainly could not have implied a desire that unions be free to embrace the tactic without restraint; congressional silence almost surely is attributable to the happy circumstance that no prohibition is urgently required because American labor unions have almost unanimously *158 fected such tactics.” Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L, Rev. 1337, 1347 (1972).  The Union argues that Congress focused upon partial strike activity during passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136 , relying upon a provision passed by the House, but rejected in the Conference Committee, that declared unlawful “any sit-down strike or other concerted interference with an employer’s operations conducted by remaining on the employer’s premises.” H. R. 3020, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., § 12 (a)(3)(A) (1947).  See H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 27-28, 43-44 (1947); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38-39, 42-43, 58-59 (1947).  The concerted refusal to work overtime in this ease does not involve “concerted interference with an employer’s operations conducted by remaining on the employer’s premises.” In NLRB v. Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S. 477</citedDecision> , the Court held that the partial strike activity in that case did not violate the union’s duty to bargain in good faith; in other words, even though the activity was not protected by § 7, it was not prohibited by § 8.  Contrary to the Court’s implication, ante, at 141, the case did not hold that the States could not prohibit such activity, but only that the NLRB had not been authorized to do so. Congress’ failure to grant power over such activity to the NLRB hardly amounts to withdrawal of the same power from the States.  The Court’s quotation, Ibid., from Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181, 187 , when read in context, is nothing more than a reference to a statement in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 , which poses, but does not answer, the question whether pre-emption extends to activity that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.  See n. 2, supra. I cannot agree with the Court’s conclusion that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, overruled today, numbers among those that have been eroded rather than preserved.  See ante, at 151-154, and n. 12.  The decision in Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra,</citedDecision> is readily distinguishable.  See n. 3, supra. It is true that Briggs-Stratton has been limited to its facts insofar as it sanctions judicial determination whether conduct arguably protected by § 7 or prohibited by § 8 is actually protected or prohibited.  Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 291 ; San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra, at 245 n. 4; see <citedDecision>Insurance Agents, supra, at 492-494</citedDecision> , and nn. 22, 23.  But the rule established in Garmon , and reaffirmed in Lockridge , is fully consistent with the conclusion that the States may regulate conduct that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.
**Combined Opinion**
 Thereafter, the employer did not make effective the proposed changes in the workday and workweek *135 before the new agreement became effective on July 23, 1972.  Although all but a very few employees complied with the Union's resolution against acceptance of overtime work during the negotiations, the employer did not discipline, or attempt to discipline, any employee for refusing to work overtime.  Instead, while negotiations continued, the employer filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board that the Union's resolution violated § 8 (b) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452 , as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (b) (3).  The Regional Director dismissed the charge on the ground that the "policy prohibiting overtime work by its member employees .  .  .  does not appear to be in violation of the Act" and therefore was not conduct cognizable by the Board under NLRB v. Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S. 477</citedDecision> (1960).  However, the employer also filed a complaint before the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission charging that the refusal to work overtime constituted an unfair labor practice under state law. The Union filed a motion before the Commission to dismiss the complaint for want of "jurisdiction over the subject matter" in that jurisdiction over "the activity of the [Union] complained of [is] pre-empted by" the National Labor Relations Act.  App. 11.  The motion was denied and the Commission adopted the Conclusion of Law of its Examiner that "the concerted refusal to work overtime, is not an activity which is arguably protected under Section 7 or arguably prohibited under Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and .  .  .  , therefore, the .

Rather, because these methods were "neither made a right under federal law nor a violation of it" the Court held that there "was no basis for denying to Wisconsin the power, in governing her internal affairs, to regulate" such conduct.  Id., at 265 .  However, the Briggs-Stratton holding that state power is not pre-empted as to peaceful conduct neither protected by § 7 nor prohibited by § 8 of the federal Act, a holding premised on the statement that "[t]his conduct is governable by the State or it is entirely ungoverned," 336 U. S., at 254 , was undercut by subsequent decisions of this Court. For the Court soon recognized that a particular activity might be "protected" by federal law not only when it fell within § 7, but also when it was an activity that Congress intended to be "unrestricted by any governmental power to regulate" because it was among the permissible "economic weapons in reserve, .  .  .  actual exercise [of which] on occasion by the parties, is part and parcel of the system that the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts have recognized." NLRB v. Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 488-489</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  "[T]he legislative purpose may .  .  .  dictate that certain activity `neither protected nor prohibited' be deemed privileged against state regulation." Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181, 187 (1965).  *142 Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra,</citedDecision> involved a charge of a refusal by the union to bargain in good faith in violation of § 8 (b) (3) of the Act.  The charge was based on union activities that occurred during good-faith bargaining over the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement.  During the negotiations, the union directed concerted on-the-job activities by its members of a harassing nature designed to interfere with the conduct of the employer's business, for the avowed purpose of putting economic pressure on the employer to accede to the union's bargaining demands.  The harassing activities, all peaceful, by the member insurance agents included refusal for a time to solicit new business, and refusal (after the writing of new business was resumed) to comply with the employer insurance company's reporting procedures; refusal to participate in a company campaign to solicit new business; reporting late at district offices the days the agents were scheduled to attend them; refusing to perform customary duties at the office, instead engaging there in "sit-in-mornings," "doing what comes naturally," and leaving at noon as a group; absenting themselves from special business conferences arranged by the company; picketing and distributing leaflets outside the various offices of the company on specified days and hours as directed by the union; distributing leaflets each day to policyholders and others and soliciting policyholders' signatures on petitions directed to the company; and presenting the signed policyholders' petitions to the company at its home office while simultaneously engaging in mass demonstrations there.  <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 480-481</citedDecision> .  We held that such tactics would not support a finding by the NLRB that the union had failed to bargain in good faith as required by § 8 (b) (3) and rejected the per se rule applied by the Board that use of "economically harassing activities" alone sufficed to prove a violation *143 of that section.  The Court assumed "that the activities in question here were not `protected' under § 7 of the Act," <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 483</citedDecision> n. 6, but held that the per se rule was beyond the authority of the NLRB to apply.  "The scope of § 8 (b) (3) and the limitations on Board power which were the design of § 8 (d) are exceeded, we hold, by inferring a lack of good faith not from any deficiencies of the union's performance at the bargaining table by reason of its attempted use of economic pressure, but solely and simply because tactics designed to exert economic pressure were employed during the course of the good-faith negotiations.  Thus the Board in the guise of determining good or bad faith in negotiations could regulate what economic weapons a party might summon to its aid.  And if the Board could regulate the choice of economic weapons that may be used as part of collective bargaining, it would be in a position to exercise considerable influence upon the substantive terms on which the parties contract.  As the parties' own devices became more limited, the Government might have to enter even more directly into the negotiation of collective agreements.  Our labor policy is not presently erected on a foundation of government control of the results of negotiations.  See S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2.

 For the policy of the national Labor Management Relations Act is not to condemn all picketing but only that ascertained by its prescribed processes to fall within its prohibitions.  Otherwise, it is implicit in the Act that the public interest is served by freedom of labor to use the weapon of picketing.  For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act prohibits." 346 U. S., at 499-500 .  [5] Moreover, San Diego Unions v. Garmon expressly recognized that "the Board may decide that an activity is neither protected nor prohibited, and thereby raise the *145 question whether such activity may be regulated by the States." 359 U. S., at 245 .  [6] It is true, however, that many decisions fleshing out the concept of activities "protected" because Congress meant them to be "unrestricted by any governmental power to regulate," Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> , involved review of per se NLRB rules applied in the regulation of the bargaining process.  E. g., NLRB v. American National Ins. Co., 343 U. S. 395 (1952); NLRB v. Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra</citedDecision> ; NLRB v. Drivers Local Union, 362 U. S. 274 (1960); NLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S. 278 (1965); American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300 (1965); cf. NLRB v. Truck Drivers Union, 353 U. S. 87 (1957); H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S. 99 (1970); Florida Power & Light v. Electrical Workers, 417 U. S. 790 , 805 n. 16 (1974).  But the analysis of Garner and <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> came full bloom in the pre-emption area in Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 (1964), which held pre-empted the application *146 of state law to award damages for peaceful union secondary picketing.  Although Morton involved conduct neither "protected nor prohibited" by § 7 or § 8 of the NLRA, we recognized the necessity of an inquiry whether " `Congress occupied this field and closed it to state regulation.' " 377 U. S., at 258 .  Central to Morton 's analysis was the observation that "[i]n selecting which forms of economic pressure should be prohibited .  .  .  , Congress struck the `balance .

 The employer in this case invoked the Wisconsin law because it was unable to overcome the Union tactic with its own economic self-help means.  [9] Although it did employ economic weapons putting pressure on the Union when it terminated the previous *149 agreement, supra, at 134, it apparently lacked sufficient economic strength to secure its bargaining demands under "the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy," Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S., at 260 .  [10] But the economic weakness of the affected party cannot justify state aid contrary to federal law for, as we have developed, "the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is not a grudging exception [under] .  .  .  the [federal] Act; it is part and parcel of the process of collective bargaining." Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 495</citedDecision> .  The state action in this case is not filling "a regulatory void which Congress plainly assumed would not exist," Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S., at 196 (BRENNAN, J., concurring).  Rather, it is clear beyond question that Wisconsin "[entered] into the substantive aspects of the bargaining process to an extent Congress has not countenanced." NLRB v. <citedDecision>Insurance Agents, supra, at 498</citedDecision> .  Our decisions hold that Congress meant that these activities, whether of employer or employees, were not to be regulable by States any more than by the NLRB, for neither States nor the Board is "afforded flexibility in picking and choosing which economic devices of labor and management shall be branded as unlawful." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Rather, both are without authority to attempt to "introduce *150 some standard of properly `balanced' bargaining power," <citedDecision>id., at 497</citedDecision> (footnote omitted), or to define "what economic sanctions might be permitted negotiating parties in an `ideal' or `balanced' state of collective bargaining." <citedDecision>Id., at 500</citedDecision> .  [11] To sanction state regulation of such economic pressure deemed by the federal Act "desirabl[y].  .  .  left for the free play of contending economic forces, .  .  .  is not merely [to fill] a gap [by] outlaw[ing] what federal law fails to outlaw; it is denying one party to an economic contest a weapon that Congress meant him to have available." Lesnick, Preemption Reconsidered: The Apparent Reaffirmation of Garmon , 72 Col. L. Rev. 469, 478 (1972).  [12] Accordingly, such regulation by *151 the State is impermissible because it " `stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' " Hill v. Florida, 325 U. S. 538 , 542 (1945).  IV There remains the question of the continuing vitality of Briggs-Stratton.  San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S., at 245 n. 4, made clear that the Briggs-Stratton approach to pre-emption is "no longer of general application." See also Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra,</citedDecision> at 493 n. 23.  We hold today that the ruling of Briggs-Stratton, permitting state regulation of partial strike activities such as are involved in this case is likewise "no longer of general application." [13] *152 Briggs-Stratton assumed "management .  .  .  would be disabled from any kind of self-help to cope with these coercive tactics of the union" and could not "take any steps to resist or combat them without incurring the sanctions of the Act." 336 U. S., at 264 .  But as <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> held, where the union activity complained of is "protected," not because it is within § 7, but only because it is an activity Congress meant to leave unregulated, "the employer could have discharged or taken other appropriate disciplinary action against the employees participating." <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 493</citedDecision> .  Moreover, even were the activity presented in the instant case "protected" activity within the meaning of § 7, [14] economic *153 weapons were available to counter the Union's refusal to work overtime, e. g., a lockout, American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300 (1965), and the hiring of permanent replacements under NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Tel. Co., 304 U. S. 333 (1938).  See Prince Lithograph Co., 205 N. L. R. B. 110, 115 (1973); Cox, The Right to Engage in Concerted Activities, 26 Ind. L. J. 319, 339 (1951); Getman, The Protection of Economic Pressure by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 115 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1195 , 1236 (1967).  Our decisions since Briggs-Stratton have made it abundantly clear that state attempts to influence the substantive terms of collective-bargaining agreements are as inconsistent with the federal regulatory scheme as are such attempts by the NLRB: "Since the federal law operates here, in an area where its authority is paramount, to leave the parties free, the inconsistent application of state law is necessarily outside the power of the State." Teamsters Union v. Oliver, 358 U. S. 283, 296 (1959).  And indubitably regulation, whether federal or State, of "the choice of economic weapons that may be used as part of collective bargaining [exerts] considerable influence upon the substantive terms on which the parties contract." NLRB v. Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 490</citedDecision> .  The availability or not of economic weapons that federal law leaves the parties free to use cannot "depend upon the forum in which the [opponent] presses its claims." Howard Johnson Co. v. Hotel Employees, 417 U. S. 249, 256 (1974).  [15] *154 Although we are not unmindful of the demands of stare decisis and the "important policy considerations militat[ing] in favor of continuity and predictability in the law," Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235, 240 (1970), Briggs-Stratton "stands as a significant departure from our .  .  .  emphasis upon the congressional policy" central to the statutory scheme it has enacted, and since our later decisions make plain that Briggs-Stratton "does not further but rather frustrates realization of an important goal of our national labor policy," Boys Markets, supra, at 241 , Briggs-Stratton is expressly overruled.

 and of contrary authority." United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 26 (1960).  V This survey of the extent to which federal labor policy and the federal Act have pre-empted state regulatory authority to police the use by employees and employers of peaceful methods of putting economic pressure upon one another compels the conclusion that the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court must be reversed.  It is not contended, and on the record could not be contended, that the Union policy against overtime work was enforced by violence or threats of intimidation or injury to property.  Workers simply left the plant at the end of their workshift and refused to volunteer for or accept overtime or Saturday work.  In sustaining the order of the Wisconsin Commission, the Wisconsin Supreme Court relied on Briggs-Stratton as dispositive against the Union's claim of pre-emption, 67 Wis. 2d, at 19 , 226 *155 N. W. 2d, at 206.  The court held further that the refusal to work overtime was neither arguably protected under § 7 nor arguably prohibited under § 8 of the federal Act, id., at 23-24, 226 N. W. 2d, at 208 , an analysis which, as developed, is largely inapplicable to the circumstances of this case. NLRB v. <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> was distinguished on the ground that that case dealt only with NLRB power "to regulate .  .  .  strike tactics" and left such "regulation .  .  .  to the states."

 [*] See Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1337 , 1355-1356 (1972).  With this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court. MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, dissenting.  If the partial strike activity in this case were protected, or even arguably protected, by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, the Court's conclusion would be supported by San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 .  But in Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 336 U. S. 245 ( Briggs-Stratton ), the Court rejected the argument that comparable activity was protected by § 7.  And as I understand the Court's holding today, it assumes *157 that this activity remains unprotected.  [1] Moreover, if such activity were prohibited, or arguably prohibited, by § 8 of the Act, the Court's conclusion would also be supported by Garmon .  But ever since NLRB v. Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S. 477</citedDecision> , it has been clear that this activity is not even arguably prohibited.  If Congress had focused on the problems presented by partial strike activity, and had enacted special legislation dealing with this subject matter, but left the form of the activity disclosed by this record unregulated, the Court's conclusion would be supported by Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 .  But this is not such a case. Despite the numerous statements in the Court's opinion about Congress' intent to leave partial strike activity wholly unregulated, I have found no legislative expression of any such intent nor any evidence that Congress has scrutinized such activity.  [2] *158 If this Court had previously held that the no-man's land in which conduct is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited by federal law is nevertheless pre-empted by an unexpressed legislative intent, I would follow such a holding.  But none of the cases reviewed in the Court's opinion so holds.  [3] Ever since 1949, when Briggs-Stratton was decided, the rule has been that partial strike activity within that area may be regulated by the States.  If adherence to the rule of Briggs-Stratton would permit *159 the States substantially to disrupt the balance Congress has struck between union and employer, I would readily join in overruling it.
**Combined Opinion**
 .  [T]he truth of the matter is that at the present statutory stage of our national labor relations policy, the two factorsnecessity for good-faith bargaining between parties, and the availability of economic pressure devices to each to make the other party incline to agree on one's termsexist side by side.  .  .  .  Doubtless one factor influences the other; there may be less need to apply economic pressure if the areas of controversy have been defined through discussion; and at the same time, negotiation positions are apt to be weak or strong in accordance with the degree of economic power the parties possess." Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 488-489</citedDecision> .  [12]  In this case we need not and do not disturb the holding of Briggs-Stratton, later remarked in Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 494</citedDecision> n. 23, that § 13 of the NLRA, 29 U. S. C. § 163 , which guarantees a qualified right to strike, is not an independent limitation on state power apart from its context in the structure of the Act.  Nor need we determine the vitality of the implication in Briggs-Stratton, also remarked in Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra,</citedDecision> at 494 n. 23, that § 501 (2) of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the NLRA, 29 U. S. C. § 142 (2), is not to be considered in connection with § 13, but rather is only an aid to construction of § 8 (b) (4), 29 U. S. C. § 158 (b) (4), of the NLRA.  We do note, however, that in determining the sense of the entire structure of the federal law respecting the use of economic pressure and the economic weapons assumed by Congress to be available to the parties, it is not insignificant that § 501 (2) in defining the term "strike" refers to the use of "any concerted slow-down or other concerted interruption of operations by employees." "It is hardly conceivable that such a word as `strike' could have been defined in these statutes without congressional realization of the obvious scope of its application." Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra,</citedDecision> at 511 n. 6 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  [13]  To the extent, however, that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, was premised on the Court's concern in that case with "evidence of considerable injury to property and intimidation of other employees by threats," 336 U. S., at 253 , that decision remains vital as an unexceptional instance of our consistent recognition of the power of the States to regulate conduct physically injuring or threatening injury to persons or property.  See supra, at 136, and n. 2.  [14]  The assumption, arguendo, in <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> that the union activities involved were "unprotected" by § 7 reflected the fact that those activities included some bearing at least a resemblance to the "sit-down" strike held unprotected in NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., 306 U. S. 240 (1939), and the "disloyal" activities held unprotected in NLRB v. Electrical Workers, 346 U. S. 464 (1953).  See Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S., at 492-494</citedDecision> .  The concerted refusal to work overtime presented in this case, however, is wholly free of such overtones.  It may be that case-by-case adjudication by the federal Board will ultimately result in the conclusion that some partial strike activities such as the concerted ban on overtime in the instant case, when unaccompanied by other aspects of conduct such as those present in <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> or those in Briggs-Stratton (overtones of threats and violence, 336 U. S., at 250 n. 8, and a refusal to specify bargaining demands, id., at 249 ; see also <citedDecision>Insurance Agents, supra, at 487</citedDecision> , and n. 13), are "protected" activities within the meaning of § 7, although not so protected as to preclude the use of available countervailing economic weapons by the employer.  See Prince Lithograph Co., 205 N. L. R. B. 110 (1973).  Compare ibid.; Dow Chemical Co., 152 N. L. R. B. 1150 (1965), with Decision, Inc., 166 N. L. R. B. 464, 479 (1967); John S. Swift Co., 124 N. L. R. B. 394 (1959).  See also Polytech, Inc., 195 N. L. R. B. 695, 696 (1972).  The Board in those cases placed emphasis on whether the decision to work overtime was voluntary with the individual in deciding whether a concerted refusal to work overtime is protected by § 7.  The parties in the instant case dispute the volitional nature of overtime prior to the concerted ban.  In light of our disposition of the case we have no occasion to address the issue.  [15]  "From [the decision in <citedDecision>Insurance Agents</citedDecision> ] it would seem to follow a fortiori that state courts and agencies may not interject their standards of `unjustifiable' or `abusive' economic weapons into the context of a collective bargaining dispute." Michelman, State Power to Govern Concerted Employee Activities, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 641 , 669 (1961).  [*]  State laws should not be regarded as neutral if they reflect an accommodation of the special interests of employers, unions, or the public in areas such as employee self-organization, labor disputes, or collective bargaining.  [1]  I recognize that there is some ambiguity in the Court's discussion, ante, at 152-153, which first implies that the employer may take any appropriate disciplinary action, including discharge, since the union activity is unprotected by § 7, and then immediately casts doubt on this assurance to the employer by indicating that some economic weapons may be used in reprisal even if the activity is protected.  The ambiguity of the Court's rationale is inconsistent with its assumption that the employer is wholly free to use economic self-help without fear of committing an unfair labor practice.  In all events, while I recognize that I may be misreading the Court's opinion, I assume that its holding rests on the predicate that the concerted refusal to work overtime in this case, like the partial strike activity in Briggs-Stratton, is unprotected by § 7.  [2]  A scholar who has criticized Briggs-Stratton has observed: "The omission of a federal prohibition against `quickie' strikes certainly could not have implied a desire that unions be free to embrace the tactic without restraint; congressional silence almost surely is attributable to the happy circumstance that no prohibition is urgently required because American labor unions have almost unanimously rejected such tactics." Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1337 , 1347 (1972).  The Union argues that Congress focused upon partial strike activity during passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136 , relying upon a provision passed by the House, but rejected in the Conference Committee, that declared unlawful "any sit-down strike or other concerted interference with an employer's operations conducted by remaining on the employer's premises." H. R. 3020, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., § 12 (a) (3) (A) (1947).  See H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 27-28, 43-44 (1947); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38-39, 42-43, 58-59 (1947).  The concerted refusal to work overtime in this case does not involve "concerted interference with an employer's operations conducted by remaining on the employer's premises." [3]  In NLRB v. Insurance Agents, <citedDecision>361 U. S. 477</citedDecision> , the Court held that the partial strike activity in that case did not violate the union's duty to bargain in good faith; in other words, even though the activity was not protected by § 7, it was not prohibited by § 8.  Contrary to the Court's implication, ante, at 141, the case did not hold that the States could not prohibit such activity, but only that the NLRB had not been authorized to do so. Congress' failure to grant power over such activity to the NLRB hardly amounts to withdrawal of the same power from the States.  The Court's quotation, ibid., from Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181, 187 , when read in context, is nothing more than a reference to a statement in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 , which poses, but does not answer, the question whether pre-emption extends to activity that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.  [4]  See n. 2, supra. [5]  I cannot agree with the Court's conclusion that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, overruled today, numbers among those that have been eroded rather than preserved.  See ante, at 151-154, and n. 12.  The decision in Insurance <citedDecision>Agents, supra,</citedDecision> is readily distinguishable.  See n. 3, supra. It is true that Briggs-Stratton has been limited to its facts insofar as it sanctions judicial determination whether conduct arguably protected by § 7 or prohibited by § 8 is actually protected or prohibited.  Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 291 ; San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra, at 245 n. 4; see <citedDecision>Insurance Agents, supra, at 492-494</citedDecision> , and nn. 22, 23.  But the rule established in Garmon , and reaffirmed in Lockridge , is fully consistent with the conclusion that the States may regulate conduct that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.
