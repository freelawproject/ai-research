 54 In light of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia we must disagree.  First, the petitioner attacks that part of § 27-2534.1 (b) (1) that authorizes a jury to consider whether a defendant has a “substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions.” The Supreme Court of Georgia, however, has demonstrated a concern that the new sentencing procedures provide guidance to juries.  It held this provision to be impermissibly vague in Arnold v. State, 236 Ga. 534, 540 , 224 S. E. 2d 386, 391 (1976), because it did not provide the jury with “sufficiently 'clear and objective standards.’ ” Second, the petitioner points to § 27-2534.1 (b)(3) which speaks of creating a “great risk of death to more than one person.” While such a phrase might be susceptible of an overly broad interpretation, the Supreme Court of Georgia has not so construed it.  The only case in which the court upheld a conviction in reliance on this aggravating circumstance involved a man who stood up in a church and fired a gun indiscriminately into the audience.  See *203 Chenault v. State, 234 Ga. 216 , 216 S. E. 2d 223 (1975).  On the other hand, the court expressly reversed a finding of great risk when the victim was simply kid-naped in a parking lot.  See Jarrell v. State, <citedDecision>234 Ga. 410, 424</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>216 S. E. 2d 258, 269</citedDecision> (1975).  55 The petitioner next argues that the requirements of Furman are not met here because the jury has the power to decline to impose the death penalty even if it finds that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances are present in the case. This contention misinterprets Furman .  See supra, at 198-199.  Moreover, it ignores the role of the Supreme Court of Georgia which reviews each death sentence to determine whether it is proportional to other sentences imposed for similar crimes.  Since the proportionality requirement on review is intended to prevent caprice in the decision to inflict the penalty, the isolated decision of a jury to afford mercy does not render unconstitutional death sentences imposed on defendants who were sentenced under a system that does not create a substantial risk of arbitrariness or caprice.  The petitioner objects, finally, to the wide scope of evidence and argument allowed at presentence hearings.  We think that the Georgia court wisely has chosen not to impose unnecessary restrictions on the evidence that can be offered at such a hearing and to approve open and far-ranging argument.
**Lead Opinion**
 The new sentencing procedures require that the State Supreme Court review every death sentence to determine whether it was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, whether the evidence supports the findings of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and “[wjhether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.” § 27-2537 (c) (3) (Supp. 1975).  56 In per *205 forming its sentence-review function, the Georgia court has held that “if the death penalty is only rarely imposed for an act or it is substantially out of line with sentences imposed for other acts it will be set aside as excessive.” Coley v. State, 231 Ga., at 834 , 204 S. E. 2d, at 616 .  The court on another occasion stated that “we view it to be our duty under the similarity standard to assure that no death sentence is affirmed unless in similar cases throughout the state the death penalty has been imposed generally .  .  .  Moore v. State, 233 Ga. 861, 864 , 213 S. E. 2d 829, 832 (1975).  See also <citedDecision>Jarrell</citedDecision> v. State, supra, at 425, 216 S. E. 2d, at 270 (standard is whether “juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty”); Smith v. State, 236 Ga. 12, 24 , 222 S. E. 2d 308, 318 (1976) (found “a clear pattern” of jury behavior).  It is apparent that the Supreme Court of Georgia has taken its review responsibilities seriously.  In Coley , it held that “[t]he prior cases indicate that the past practice among juries faced with similar factual situations and like aggravating circumstances has been to impose only the sentence of life imprisonment for the offense of rape, rather than death.” 231 Ga., at 835 , 204 S. E. 2d, at 617 .  It thereupon reduced Coley's sentence from death to life imprisonment.  Similarly, although armed robbery is a capital offense under Georgia law, § 26-1902 (1972), the Georgia court concluded that the death sentences imposed in this case for that crime were “unusual in that they are rarely imposed for [armed robbery], Thus, under the test provided by statute, .  .  .  they must be considered to be excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.” 233 *206 Ga., at 127, 210 S. E. 2d, at 667 .  The court therefore vacated Gregg's death sentences for armed robbery and has followed a similar course in every other armed robbery death penalty case to come before it.  See Floyd v. State, 233 Ga. 280, 285 , 210 S. E. 2d 810, 814 (1974); Jarrell v. State, 234 Ga., at 424-425, <citedDecision>216 S. E. 2d, at 270</citedDecision> .  See Dorsey v. State, 236 Ga. 591 , 225 S. E. 2d 418 (1976).  The provision for appellate review in the Georgia capital-sentencing system serves as a check against the random or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.  In particular, the proportionality review substantially eliminates the possibility that a person will be sentenced to die by the action of an aberrant jury.  If a time comes when juries generally do not impose the death sentence in a certain kind of murder case, the appellate review procedures assure that no defendant convicted under such circumstances will suffer a sentence of death.  V The basic concern of Furman centered on those defendants who were being condemned to death capriciously and arbitrarily.  Under the procedures before the Court in that case, sentencing authorities were not directed to give attention to the nature or circumstances of the crime committed or to the character or record of the defendant.

 U. S. Const., Art. II, § 2.  In light of the limited grant of certiorari, see supra, at 162, we review the “vagueness” and “overbreadth” of the statutory aggravating circumstances only to consider whether their imprecision renders this capital-sentencing system invalid under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it is incapable of imposing capital punishment other than by arbitrariness or caprice.  In the course of interpreting Florida’s new capital-sentencing statute, the Supreme Court of Florida has ruled that the phrase “especially heinous, atrocious or cruel” means a “conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim.” State v. Dixon, 283 So. 2d 1, 9 (1973).  See Proffitt v. Florida, post, at 255-256.  Two other reported cases indicate that juries have found aggravating circumstances based on § 27-2534.1 (b) (7).  In both cases a separate statutory aggravating circumstance was also found, and the Supreme Court of Georgia did not explicitly rely on the finding of the seventh circumstance when it upheld the death sentence.  See Jarrell v. State, <citedDecision>234 Ga. 410</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>216 S. E. 2d 258</citedDecision> (1975) (State Supreme Court upheld finding that defendant committed two other capital felonies — kidnaping and armed robbery — in the course of *202 the murder, §27-2534.1 (b)(2); jury also found that the murder was committed for money, § 27-2534.1 (b) (4), and that a great risk of death to bystanders was created, § 27-2534.1 (b) (3)); Floyd v. State, 233 Ga. 280 , 210 S. E. 2d 810 (1974) (found to have committed a capital felony — armed robbery' — in the course of the murder, §27-2534.1 (b)(2)).  The petitioner also attacks § 25-2534.1 (b) (7) as vague.  As we have noted in answering his overbreadth argument concerning this section, however, the state court has not given a broad reading to the scope of this provision, and there is no reason to think that juries will not be able to understand it.  See n. 51, supra; Proffitt v. Florida, post, at 255-256.  The petitioner also objects to the last part of § 27-2534.1 (b) (3) which requires that the great risk be created “by means of a weapon or device which would normally be hazardous to the lives of more than one person.” While the state court has not focused on this section, it seems reasonable to assume that if a great risk in fact is created, it will be likely that a weapon or device normally hazardous to more than one person will have created it.  The court is required to specify in its opinion the similar cases which it took into consideration.  § 27-2537 (e) (Supp. 1975).
**Concurrence Opinion**
 The court also has the obligation of determining whether the penalty was “imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.” §27-2537 (c)(1) (Supp. 1975).  The Georgia Supreme Court has interpreted the appellate review statute to require it to set aside the death sentence whenever juries across the State impose it only rarely for the type of crime in question; but to require it to affirm death sentences whenever juries across the State generally impose it for the crime in question.  *224 Thus, in this case the Georgia Supreme Court concluded that the death penalty was so rarely imposed for the crime of robbery that it set aside the sentences on the robbery counts, and effectively foreclosed that penalty from being imposed for that crime in the future under the legislative scheme now in existence.  Similarly, the Georgia Supreme Court has determined that juries impose the death sentence too rarely with respect to certain classes of rape.  Compare Coley v. State, 231 Ga. 829 , 204 S. E. 2d 612 (1974), with Coker v. State, 234 Ga. 555 , 216 S. E. 2d 782 (1975).  However, it concluded that juries “generally throughout the state” have imposed the death penalty for those who murder witnesses to armed robberies.  Jarrell v. State, <citedDecision>234 Ga. 410, 425</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>216 S. E. 2d 258, 270</citedDecision> .  (1975).  Consequently, it affirmed the sentences in this case on the murder counts.  If the Georgia Supreme Court is correct with respect to this factual judgment, imposition of the death penalty in this and similar cases is consistent with Furman .  Indeed, if the Georgia Supreme Court properly performs the task assigned to it under the Georgia statutes, death sentences imposed for discriminatory reasons or wantonly or freakishly for any given category of crime will be set aside.  Petitioner has wholly failed to establish, and has not even attempted to establish, that the Georgia Supreme Court failed properly to perform its task in this case or that it is incapable of performing its task adequately in all cases; and this Court should not assume that it did not do so. Petitioner also argues that decisions made by the prosecutor — either in negotiating a plea to some lesser offense than capital murder or in simply declining to charge capital murder — are standardless and will inexorably result in the wanton and freakish imposition of the penalty condemned by the judgment in Furman .  I address this *225 point separately because the cases in which no capital offense is charged escape the view of the Georgia Supreme Court and are not considered by it in determining whether a particular sentence is excessive or disproportionate.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 All kidnapping cases were likewise reviewed.  The comparison involved a search for similarities in addition to the similarity of offense charged and sentence imposed.  “All of the murder cases selected for comparison involved mur *220 ders wherein all of the witnesses were killed or an attempt was made to kill all of the witnesses, and kidnapping eases where the victim was killed or seriously injured.  “The cases indicate that, except in some special circumstance such as a juvenile or an accomplice driver of a get-away vehicle, where the murder was committed and trial held at a time when the death penalty statute was effective, juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty.  The death penalty has also been imposed when the kidnap victim has been mistreated or seriously injured.  In this case the victim was murdered.  “The cold blooded and callous nature of the offenses in this case are the types condemned by death in other cases. This defendant's death sentences for murder and kidnapping are not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Using the standards prescribed for our review by the statute, we conclude that the sentences of death imposed in this case for murder and kidnapping were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.” Jarrell v. State, <citedDecision>234 Ga. 410, 425-426</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>216 S. E. 2d 258, 270</citedDecision> (1975).  See Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 240 (Douglas, J., concurring).  See id., at 306 (Stewart, J., concurring).  See id., at 310 (White, J., concurring).  Petitioner also argues that the differences between murder — for which the death penalty may be imposed — and manslaughter — -for which it may not be imposed- — -are so difficult to define and the jury’s ability to disobey the trial judge’s instructions so unfettered that juries will use the guilt-determination phase of a trial arbitrarily to convict some,of a capital offense while convicting similarly situated individuals only of noncapital offenses.  I believe this argument is enormously overstated.  However, since the jury has discretion not to impose the death penalty at the sentencing phase of a case in Georgia, the problem of offense definition and jury nullification loses virtually all its significance in this case. The factor relevant to this case is that the “murder .
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Brennan, dissenting. * The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause “must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” 1 The opinions of Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Powell, and Mr. Justice Stevens today hold that “evolving standards of decency” require focus not on the essence of the death penalty itself but primarily upon the procedures employed by the State to single out persons to suffer the penalty of death. Those opinions hold further that, so viewed, the Clause invalidates the mandatory infliction of the death penalty but not its infliction under sentencing procedures that Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Powell, and Mr. Justice Stevens conclude adequately safeguard against the risk that the death penalty was imposed in an arbitrary and capricious manner. In Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 257 (1972) (concurring opinion), I read “evolving standards of decency” as requiring focus upon the essence of the death penalty itself and not primarily or solely upon the procedures *228 under which the determination to inflict the penalty upon a particular person was made. I there said: “From the beginning of our Nation, the punishment of death has stirred acute public controversy. Although pragmatic arguments for and against the punishment have been frequently advanced, this longstanding and heated controversy cannot be explained solely as the result of differences over the practical wisdom of a particular government policy. At bottom, the battle has been waged on moral grounds. The country has debated whether a society for which the dignity of the individual is the supreme value can, without a fundamental inconsistency, follow the practice of deliberately putting some of its members to death. In the United States, as in other nations of the western world, 'the struggle about this punishment has been one between ancient and deeply rooted beliefs in retribution, atonement or vengeance on the one hand, and, on the other, beliefs in the personal value and dignity of the common man that were born of the democratic movement of the eighteenth century, as well as beliefs in the scientific approach to an understanding of the motive forces of human conduct, which are the result of the growth of the sciences of behavior during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.’ It is this essentially moral conflict that forms the backdrop for the past changes in and the present operation of our system of imposing death as a punishment for crime.” Id., at 296 . 2 That continues to be my view. For the Clause forbidding cruel and unusual punishments under our con *229 stitutional system of government embodies in unique degree moral principles restraining the punishments that our civilized society may impose on those persons who transgress its laws. Thus, I too say: “For myself, I do not hesitate to assert the proposition that the only way the law has progressed from the days of the rack, the screw and the wheel is the development of moral concepts, or, as stated by the Supreme Court . . . the application of 'evolving standards of decency’ . 3 This Court inescapably has the duty, as the ultimate arbiter of the meaning of our Constitution, to say whether, when individuals condemned to death stand before our Bar, “moral concepts” require us to hold that the law has progressed to the point where we should declare that the punishment of death, like punishments on the rack, the screw, and the wheel, is no longer morally tolerable in our civilized society. 4 My opinion in Furman v. Georgia concluded that our civilization and the law had progressed to this point and that therefore the punishment of death, for whatever crime and under all circumstances, is “cruel and unusual” in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. I shall not again canvass the reasons that led to that conclusion. I emphasize only that foremost among the “moral concepts” recognized in our cases and inherent in the Clause is the primary moral principle that the State, even as it punishes, must treat its citizens in a manner consistent with their intrinsic worth as human beings — a punishment must not be so severe as to be degrading to human dignity. A judicial determina *230 tion whether the punishment of death comports with human dignity is therefore not only permitted but compelled by the Clause. 408 U. S., at 270 . I do not understand that the Court disagrees that “[i]n comparison to all other punishments today . . . the deliberate extinguishment of human life by the State is uniquely degrading to human dignity.” Id., at 291 . For three of my Brethren hold today that mandatory infliction of the death penalty constitutes the penalty cruel and unusual punishment. I perceive no principled basis for this limitation. Death for whatever crime and under all circumstances “is truly an awesome punishment. The calculated killing of a human being by the State involves, by its very nature, a denial of the executed person’s humanity. . . . An executed person has indeed 'lost the right to have rights.’ ” Id., at 290 . Death is not only an unusually severe punishment, unusual in its pain, in its finality, and in its enormity, but it serves no penal purpose more effectively than a less severe punishment; therefore the principle inherent in the Clause that prohibits pointless infliction of excessive punishment when less severe punishment can adequately achieve the same purposes invalidates the punishment. Id., at 279 . The fatal constitutional infirmity in the punishment of death is that it treats “members of the human race as nonhumans, as objects to be toyed with and discarded. [It is] thus inconsistent with the fundamental premise of the Clause that even the vilest criminal remains a human being possessed of common human dignity.” Id., at 273 . As such it is a penalty that “subjects the individual to a fate forbidden by the principle of civilized treatment guaranteed by the [Clause].” 5 I therefore would hold, *231 on that ground alone, that death is today a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Clause. “Justice of this kind is obviously no less shocking than the crime itself, and the new 'official’ murder, far from offering redress for the offense committed against society, adds instead a second defilement to the first.” 6 I dissent from the judgments in No. 7-U6257, Gregg v. Georgia , No. 75-5706, Proffitt v. Florida, and No. 75-5394, Jurek v. Texas, insofar as each upholds the death sentences challenged in those cases. I would set aside the death sentences imposed in those cases as vio-lative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. [This opinion applies also to No. 75-5706, Proffitt v.

 The comparison involved a search for similarities in addition to the similarity of offense charged and sentence imposed.  "All of the murder cases selected for comparison involved murders wherein all of the witnesses were killed or an attempt was made to kill all of the witnesses, and kidnapping cases where the victim was killed or seriously injured.  "The cases indicate that, except in some special circumstance such as a juvenile or an accomplice driver of a get-away vehicle, where the murder was committed and trial held at a time when the death penalty statute was effective, juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty.  The death penalty has also been imposed when the kidnap victim has been mistreated or seriously injured.  In this case the victim was murdered.

[9]  Petitioner also argues that the differences between murderfor which the death penalty may be imposedand manslaughterfor which it may not be imposedare so difficult to define and the jury's ability to disobey the trial judge's instructions so unfettered that juries will use the guilt-determination phase of a trial arbitrarily to convict some of a capital offense while convicting similarly situated individuals only of noncapital offenses.  I believe this argument is enormously overstated.  However, since the jury has discretion not to impose the death penalty at the sentencing phase of a case in Georgia, the problem of offense definition and jury nullification loses virtually all its significance in this case.
