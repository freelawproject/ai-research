<p id="Asz6">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b796-6">This is a case about federalism. It concerns the respect that federal courts owe the States and the States’ procedural rules when reviewing the claims of state prisoners in federal habeas corpus.</p>

<p id="b796-8">A Buchanan County, Virginia, jury convicted Roger Keith Coleman of rape and capital murder and fixed the sentence at <page-number citation-index="1" label="727">*727</page-number>death for the murder. The trial court imposed the death sentence, and the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed both the convictions and the sentence. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1227505"><a href="/opinion/1227505/coleman-v-commonwealth/" aria-description="Citation for case: Coleman v.

<p id="b797-5">Coleman then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court for Buchanan County, raising numerous federal constitutional claims that he had not raised on direct appeal. After a 2-day evidentiary hearing, the Circuit Court ruled against Coleman on all claims. App. 3-19. The court entered its final judgment on September 4, 1986.</p>
<p id="b797-6">Coleman filed his notice of appeal with the Circuit Court on October 7, 1986, 33 days after the entry of final judgment. Coleman subsequently filed a petition for appeal in the Virginia Supreme Court. The Commonwealth of Virginia, as appellee, filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. The sole ground for dismissal urged in the motion was that Coleman’s notice of appeal had been filed late. Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:9(a) provides that no appeal shall be allowed unless a notice of appeal is filed with the trial court within 30 days of final judgment.</p>
<p id="b797-7">The Virginia Supreme Court did not act immediately on the Commonwealth’s motion, and both parties filed several briefs on the subject of the motion to dismiss and on the merits of the claims in Coleman’s petition. On May 19, 1987, the Virginia Supreme Court issued the following order, dismissing Coleman’s appeal:</p>
<blockquote id="b797-8">“On December 4, 1986 came the appellant, by counsel, and filed a petition for appeal in the above-styled case.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b797-9">“Thereupon came the appellee, by the Attorney General of Virginia, and filed a motion to dismiss the petition for appeal; on December 19, 1986 the appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss; on December 19, 1986 the appellee filed a reply to the appellant’s memorandum; on December 23, 1986 the appellee <page-number citation-index="1" label="728">*728</page-number>filed a brief in opposition to the petition for appeal; on December 23, 1986 the appellant filed a surreply in opposition to the appellee’s motion to dismiss; and on January 6, 1987 the appellant filed a reply brief.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b798-5">“Upon consideration whereof, the motion to dismiss is granted and the petition for appeal is dismissed.” App. 25-26.</blockquote>
<p id="b798-6">This Court again denied certiorari. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Bass, </em><span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./484/918/">484 U. S. 918</a></span> (1987).</p>
<p id="b798-7">Coleman next filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. In his petition, Coleman presented four federal constitutional claims he had raised on direct appeal in the Virginia Supreme Court and seven claims he had raised for the first time in state habeas. The District Court concluded that, by virtue of the dismissal of his appeal by the Virginia Supreme Copurt in state habeas, Coleman had procedurally defaulted the seven claims. Ap. 38-39. The District Court nonetheless went on to address the merits of all 11 of Coleman’s claims. The court ruled against Coleman on all of the claims and denied the petition. <em>Id., </em>at 40-52.</p>
<p id="b798-8">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. <span class="citation" data-id="536051"><a href="/opinion/536051/roger-k-coleman-v-charles-thompson-warden/" aria-description="Citation for case: Roger K. Coleman v. Charles Thompson, Warden">895 F. 2d 139</a></span> (1990). The court held that Coleman had defaulted all of the claims that he had presented for the first time in state habeas. Coleman argued that the Virginia Supreme Court had not “clearly and expressly” stated that its decision in state habeas was based on a procedural default, and therefore the federal courts could not treat it as such under the rule of <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Reed, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112205"><a href="/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v.

It concluded that the Virginia Supreme Court had met the “plain statement” requirement of <em><span class="citation" data-id="112205"><a href="/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v.

The Fourth Circuit held that the Virginia Supreme Court's deci<page-number citation-index="1" label="729">*729</page-number>sion rested on independent and adequate state grounds and that Coleman had not shown cause to excuse the default. <span class="citation" data-id="536051"><a href="/opinion/536051/roger-k-coleman-v-charles-thompson-warden/#143" aria-description="Citation for case: Roger K.

<p id="b799-2">This Court will not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment. See, <em>e. g., Fox Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Muller, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102505"><a href="/opinion/102505/fox-film-corp-v-muller/#210" aria-description="Citation for case: Fox Film Corp. v. Muller">296 U. S. 207, 210</a></span> (1935); <em>Klinger </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em><span class="citation" data-id="88459"><a href="/opinion/88459/klinger-v-missouri/#263" aria-description="Citation for case: Klinger v. Missouri">13 Wall. 257, 263</a></span> (1872). This rule applies whether the state law ground is substantive or procedural. See, <em>e. g., Fox <span class="citation" data-id="102505"><a href="/opinion/102505/fox-film-corp-v-muller/" aria-description="Citation for case: Fox Film Corp. v. Muller">Film, supra;</a></span> Herndon </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102468"><a href="/opinion/102468/herndon-v-georgia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Herndon v. Georgia">295 U. S. 441</a></span> (1935). In the context of direct review of a state court judgment, the independent and adequate state ground doctrine is jurisdictional. Because this Court has no power to review a state law determination that is sufficient to support the judgment, resolution of any independent federal ground for the decision could not affect the judgment and would therefore be advisory. See <em>Herb </em>v. <em>Pitcairn, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1087618"><a href="/opinion/1087618/herb-v-pitcairn/#125" aria-description="Citation for case: Herb v. Pitcairn">324 U. S. 117, 125-126</a></span> (1945) (“We are not permitted to render an advisory opinion, and if the same judgment would be rendered by the state court after we corrected its views of federal laws, our review could amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion”).</p>
<p id="b799-3">We have applied the independent and adequate state ground doctrine not only in our own review of state court judgments, but in deciding whether federal district courts should address the claims of state prisoners in habeas corpus actions. The doctrine applies to bar federal habeas when <page-number citation-index="1" label="730">*730</page-number>a state court declined to address a prisoner’s federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement. In these cases, the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds. See <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109717"><a href="/opinion/109717/wainwright-v-sykes/#81" aria-description="Citation for case: Wainwright v. Sykes">433 U. S. 72, 81, 87</a></span> (1977); <em>Ulster County Court </em>v. <em>Allen, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110093"><a href="/opinion/110093/county-court-of-ulster-cty-v-allen/#148" aria-description="Citation for case: County Court of Ulster Cty. v.

Reed"><em>Harris, supra, </em>at 262</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b800-5">The basis for application of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in federal habeas is somewhat different than on direct review by this Court. When this Court reviews a state court decision on direct review pursuant to <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. § 1257</span>, it is reviewing the <em>judgment; </em>if resolution of a federal question cannot affect the judgment, there is nothing for the Court to do. This is not the case in habeas. When a federal district court reviews a state prisoner’s ha-beas corpus petition pursuant to <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. § 2254</span>, it must decide whether the petitioner is “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” <em><span class="citation no-link">Ibid.</span> </em>The court does not review a judgment, but the lawfulness of the petitioner’s custody <em>simpliciter. </em>See <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106548"><a href="/opinion/106548/fay-v-noia/#430" aria-description="Citation for case: Fay v. Noia">372 U. S. 391, 430</a></span> (1963).</p>
<p id="b800-6">Nonetheless, a state prisoner is in custody <em>pursuant </em>to a judgment. When a federal habeas court releases a prisoner held pursuant to a state court judgment that rests on an independent and adequate state ground, it renders ineffective the state rule just as completely as if this Court had reversed the state judgment on direct review. See <span class="citation" data-id="106548"><a href="/opinion/106548/fay-v-noia/#469" aria-description="Citation for case: Fay v. Noia"><em>id., </em>at 469</a></span> (Harlan, J., dissenting). In such a case, the habeas court ignores the State’s legitimate reasons for holding the prisoner.</p>
<p id="b800-7">In the habeas context, the application of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine is grounded in concerns of comity and federalism. Without the rule, a federal district court would be able to do in habeas what this Court could not do on direct review; habeas would offer state prisoners whose custody was supported by independent and ade<page-number citation-index="1" label="731">*731</page-number>quate state grounds an end run around the limits of this Court’s jurisdiction and a means to undermine the State’s interest in enforcing its laws.</p>
<p id="b801-5">When the independent and adequate state ground supporting a habeas petitioner’s custody is a state procedural default, an additional concern comes into play. This Court has long held that a state prisoner’s federal habeas petition should be dismissed if the prisoner has not exhausted available state remedies as to any of his federal claims. See <em>Ex parte Royall, </em><span class="citation" data-id="91598"><a href="/opinion/91598/ex-parte-royall/" aria-description="Citation for case: Ex Parte Royall">117 U. S. 241</a></span> (1886). See also <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Lundy, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110662"><a href="/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rose v. Lundy">455 U. S. 509</a></span> (1982); <em>Castille </em>v. <em>Peoples, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112207"><a href="/opinion/112207/castille-v-peoples/" aria-description="Citation for case: Castille v. Peoples">489 U. S. 346</a></span> (1989); <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. § 2254</span>(b) (codifying the rule). This exhaustion requirement is also grounded in principles of comity; in a federal system, the States should have the first opportunity to address and correct alleged violations of state prisoner’s federal rights. As we explained in <em><span class="citation" data-id="110662"><a href="/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rose v. Lundy">Rose, supra:</a></span></em></p>
<blockquote id="b801-6">“The exhaustion doctrine is principally designed to protect the state courts’ role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state judicial proceedings. See <em>Braden </em>v. <em>30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108730"><a href="/opinion/108730/braden-v-30th-judicial-circuit-court-of-kentucky/#490" aria-description="Citation for case: Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky">410 U. S. 484, 490-491</a></span> (1973). Under our federal system, the federal and state ‘courts [are] equally bound to guard and protect rights secured by the Constitution.’ <em>Ex parte Royall, </em><span class="citation" data-id="91598"><a href="/opinion/91598/ex-parte-royall/#251" aria-description="Citation for case: Ex Parte Royall">117 U. S., at 251</a></span>. Because ‘it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation,’ federal courts apply the doctrine of comity, which ‘teaches that one court should defer action on causes properly within its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty with concurrent powers, and already cognizant of the litigation, have had an opportunity to pass upon the matter.’ <em>Darr </em>v. <em>Burford, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104779"><a href="/opinion/104779/darr-v-burford/#204" aria-description="Citation for case: Darr v. Burford">339 U. S. 200, 204</a></span> (1950).” <em>Id., </em>at 518.</blockquote>
<p id="b801-7">These same concerns apply to federal claims that have been procedurally defaulted in state court. Just as in those <page-number citation-index="1" label="732">*732</page-number>cases in which a state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a habeas petitioner who has failed to meet the State’s procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in the first instance. A habeas petitioner who has defaulted his federal claims in state court meets the technical requirements for exhaustion; there are no state remedies any longer “available” to him. See <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. § 2254</span>(b); <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110692"><a href="/opinion/110692/engle-v-isaac/#125" aria-description="Citation for case: Engle v. Isaac">456 U. S. 107, 125-126, n. 28</a></span> (1982). In the absence of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in federal habeas, habeas petitioners would be able to avoid the exhaustion requirement by defaulting their federal claims in state court. The independent and adequate state ground doctrine ensures that the States’ interest in correcting their own mistakes is respected in all federal habeas cases.</p>
<p id="b802-5">B</p>
<p id="b802-6">It is not always easy for a federal court to apply the independent and adequate state ground doctrine. State court opinions will, at times, discuss federal questions at length and mention a state law basis for decision only briefly. In such cases, it is often difficult to determine if the state law discussion is truly an independent basis for decision or merely a passing reference. In other cases, state opinions purporting to apply state constitutional law will derive principles by reference to federal constitutional decisions from this Court. Again, it is unclear from such opinions whether the state law decision is independent of federal law.</p>
<p id="b802-7">In <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111020"><a href="/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan v. Long">463 U. S. 1032</a></span> (1983), we provided a partial solution to this problem in the form of a conclusive presumption. Prior to <em><span class="citation" data-id="111020"><a href="/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan v. Long">Long</a></span>, </em>when faced with ambiguous state court decisions, this Court had adopted, various inconsistent and unsatisfactory solutions including dismissal of the case, remand to the state court for clarification, or an independent investigation of state law. <span class="citation" data-id="111020"><a href="/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/#1038" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan v. Long"><em>Id., </em>at 1038-1040</a></span>. These solutions were burdensome both to this Court and to <page-number citation-index="1" label="733">*733</page-number>the state courts. They were also largely unnecessary in those cases where it fairly appeared that the state court decision rested primarily on federal law. The most reasonable conclusion in such cases is that there is not an independent and adequate state ground for the decision. Therefore, in order to minimize the costs associated with resolving ambiguities in state court decisions while still fulfilling our obligation to determine if there was an independent and adequate state ground for the decision, we established a conclusive presumption of jurisdiction in these cases:</p>
<blockquote id="b803-5">“[W]hen, as in this case, a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion, we will accept as the most reasonable explanation that the state court decided the case the way it did because it believed that federal law required it to do so.” <span class="citation" data-id="111020"><a href="/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/#1040" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan v.

<p id="b803-7">In <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111471"><a href="/opinion/111471/caldwell-v-mississippi/" aria-description="Citation for case: Caldwell v.

Caldwell, a criminal defendant, challenged at trial part of the prosecutor’s closing argument to the jury, but he did not raise the issue on appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court. That court raised the issue <em>sua sponte, </em>discussing this federal question at length in its opinion and deciding it against Caldwell. The court also made reference to its general rule that issues not raised on appeal are deemed waived. The State argued to this Court that the procedural default constituted an independent and adequate state ground for the Mississippi <page-number citation-index="1" label="734">*734</page-number>court’s decision. We rejected this argument, noting that the state decision “‘fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law,”’ and there was no clear and express statement that the Mississippi Supreme Court was relying on procedural default as an independent ground. <em>Id., </em>at 327, quoting <span class="citation" data-id="111020"><a href="/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/#1040" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan v.

In its order, the Appellate Court referred to the Illinois rule that “ ‘those [issues] which could have been presented [on direct appeal], but were not, are considered waived.’” <span class="citation" data-id="112205"><a href="/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/#258" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v.

<p id="b806-5">Coleman has read the rule out of context.

<p id="b806-6">Coleman urges a broader rule: that the presumption applies in all cases in which a habeas petitioner presented his federal claims to the state court. This rule makes little sense. In direct review cases, “[i]t is . . . ‘incumbent upon this Court ... to ascertain for itself . . . whether the asserted non-federal ground independently and adequately supports the [state court] judgment.’” <span class="citation" data-id="111020"><a href="/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/#1038" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan v.

Similarly, federal habeas courts must ascertain for themselves if the petitioner is in custody pursuant to a state court judgment that rests on independent and adequate state grounds. In cases in which the <em><span class="citation" data-id="111020"><a href="/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan v. Long">Long</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="112205"><a href="/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v. Reed">Harris</a></span> </em>presump<page-number citation-index="1" label="737">*737</page-number>tion applies, federal courts will conclude that the relevant state court judgment does not rest on an independent and adequate state ground. The presumption, like all conclusive presumptions, is designed to avoid the costs of excessive inquiry where a <em>per se </em>rule will achieve the correct result in almost all cases. As we explained in a different context:</p>
<blockquote id="b807-5"><em>“Per se </em>rules . . . require the Court to make broad generalizations .... Cases that do not fit the generalization may arise, but a <em>per se </em>rule reflects the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to identify them.” <em>Continental T. V., Inc. </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="109716"><a href="/opinion/109716/continental-t-v-inc-v-gte-sylvania-inc/#50" aria-description="Citation for case: Continental T. v.  Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.">433 U. S. 36, 50, n. 16</a></span> (1977).</blockquote>
<p id="b807-6"><em>Per se </em>rules should not be applied, however, in situations where the generalization is incorrect as an empirical matter; the justification for a conclusive presumption disappears when application of the presumption will not reach the correct result most of the time. The <em><span class="citation" data-id="111020"><a href="/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan v. Long">Long</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="112205"><a href="/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v. Reed">Harris</a></span> </em>presumption works because in the majority of cases in which a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with such law, and the state court does not plainly state that it is relying on an independent and adequate state ground, the state court decision did not in fact rest on an independent and adequate state ground. We accept errors in those small number of cases where there was nonetheless an independent and adequate state ground in exchange for a significant reduction in the costs of inquiry.</p>
<p id="b807-7">The tradeoff is very different when the factual predicate does not exist. In those cases in which it does not fairly appear that the state court rested its decision primarily on federal grounds, it is simply not true that the “most reasonable explanation” is that the state judgment rested on federal grounds. Cf. <span class="citation" data-id="111020"><a href="/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/#1041" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan v. Long"><em>Long, supra, </em>at 1041</a></span>. Yet Coleman would have the federal courts apply a conclusive presumption of no independent and adequate state grounds in every case in which a state prisoner presented his federal claims to a state <page-number citation-index="1" label="738">*738</page-number>court, regardless of whether it fairly appears that the state court addressed those claims. We cannot accept such a rule, for it would greatly and unacceptably expand the risk that federal courts will review the federal claims of prisoners in custody pursuant to judgments resting on independent and adequate state grounds. Any efficiency gained by applying a conclusive presumption, and thereby avoiding inquiry into state law, is simply not worth the cost in the loss of respect for the State that such a rule would entail.</p>
<p id="b808-5">It may be argued that a broadly applicable presumption is not counterfactual after it is announced: Once state courts know that their decisions resting on independent and adequate state procedural grounds will be honored in federal habeas only if there is a clear and express statement of the default, these courts will provide such a statement in all relevant cases. This argument does not help Coleman. Even assuming that <em><span class="citation" data-id="112205"><a href="/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v. Reed">Harris</a></span> </em>can be read as establishing a presumption in all cases, the Virginia Supreme Court issued its order dismissing Coleman’s appeal <em>before </em>this Court decided <em><span class="citation" data-id="112205"><a href="/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v. Reed">Harris</a></span>. </em>As to this state court order, the absence of an express statement of procedural default is not very informative.</p>
<p id="b808-6">In any event, we decline to establish such a rule here, for it would place burdens on the States and state courts in exchange for very little benefit to the federal courts. We are, as an initial matter, far from confident that the empirical assumption of the argument for such a rule is correct. It is not necessarily the case that state courts will take pains to provide a clear and express statement of procedural default in all cases, even after announcement of the rule. State courts presumably have a dignitary interest in seeing that their state law decisions are not ignored by a federal habeas court, but most of the price paid for federal review of state prisoner claims is paid by the State. When a federal habeas court considers the federal claims of a prisoner in state custody for independent and adequate state law reasons, it is the State that must respond. It is the State that pays the price in <page-number citation-index="1" label="739">*739</page-number>terms of the uncertainty and delay added to the enforcement of its criminal laws. It is the State that must retry the petitioner if the federal courts reverse his conviction. If a state court, in the course of disposing of cases on its overcrowded docket, neglects to provide a clear and express statement of procedural default, or is insufficiently motivated to do so, there is little the State can do about it. Yet it is primarily respect for the State’s interests that underlies the application of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in federal habeas.</p>
<p id="b809-5">A broad presumption would also put too great a burden on the state courts. It remains the duty of the federal courts, whether this Court on direct review, or lower federal courts in habeas, to determine the scope of the relevant state court judgment. We can establish a <em>per se </em>rule that eases the burden of inquiry on the federal courts in those cases where there are few costs to doing so, but we have no power to tell state courts how they must write their opinions. We encourage state courts to express plainly, in every decision potentially subject to federal review, the grounds upon which their judgments rest, but we will not impose on state courts the responsibility for using particular language in every case in which a state prisoner presents a federal claim — every state appeal, every denial of state collateral review — in order that federal courts might not be bothered with reviewing state law and the record in the case.</p>
<p id="b809-6">Nor do we believe that the federal courts will save much work by applying the <em><span class="citation" data-id="112205"><a href="/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v. Reed">Harris</a></span> </em>presumption in all cases. The presumption at present applies only, when it fairly appears that a state court judgment rested primarily on federal law or was interwoven with federal law, that is, in those cases where a federal court has good reason to question whether there is an independent and adequate state ground for the decision. In the rest of the cases, there is little need for a conclusive presumption. In the absence of a clear indication <page-number citation-index="1" label="740">*740</page-number>that a state court rested its decision on federal law, a federal court’s task will not be difficult.</p>
<p id="b810-5">There is, in sum, little that the federal courts will gain by applying a presumption of federal review in those cases where the relevant state court decision does not fairly appear ■ to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with such law, and much that the States and state courts will lose. We decline to so expand the <em><span class="citation" data-id="112205"><a href="/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v. Reed">Harris</a></span> </em>presumption.</p>

<p id="b810-7">The <em><span class="citation" data-id="112205"><a href="/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v. Reed">Harris</a></span> </em>presumption does not apply here. Coleman does not argue, nor could he, that it “fairly appears” that the Virginia Supreme Court’s decision rested primarily on federal law or was interwoven with such law. The Virginia Supreme Court stated plainly that it was granting the Commonwealth’s motion to dismiss the petition for appeal. That motion was based solely on Coleman’s failure to meet the Supreme Court’s time requirements. There is no mention of federal law in the Virginia Supreme Court’s three-sentence dismissal order. It “fairly appears” to rest primarily on state law.</p>
<p id="b810-8">Coleman concedes that the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed his state habeas appeal as untimely, applying a state procedural rule. Brief for Petitioner 9. He argues instead that the court’s application of this procedural rule was not independent of federal law.</p>
<p id="b810-9">Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:5(a) declares that the 80-day requirement for filing a notice of appeal is “mandatory.” The Virginia Supreme Court has reiterated the unwaivable nature of this requirement.

Rather, Coleman <page-number citation-index="1" label="741">*741</page-number>asserts, the court first considered the merits of his federal claims and applied the procedural bar only after determining that doing so would not abridge one of Coleman’s constitutional rights. In <em>Ake </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111356"><a href="/opinion/111356/ake-v-oklahoma/" aria-description="Citation for case: Ake v. Oklahoma">470 U. S. 68</a></span> (1985), this Court held that a similar Oklahoma rule, excusing procedural default in cases of “fundamental trial error,” was not independent of federal law so as to bar direct review because “the State ha[d] made application of the procedural bar depend on an antecedent ruling on federal law.” <span class="citation" data-id="111356"><a href="/opinion/111356/ake-v-oklahoma/#75" aria-description="Citation for case: Ake v.

<p id="b811-6">Coleman cites <em>Tharp </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1207031"><a href="/opinion/1207031/tharp-v-commonwealth/" aria-description="Citation for case: Tharp v.

E. 2d 277</a></span> (1970). In that case, the Virginia Supreme Court announced that it was ending its practice of allowing extensions of time for petitions of writs of error in criminal and state habeas cases:</p>
<blockquote id="b811-7">“Henceforth we will extend the time for filing a petition for a writ of error only if it is found that to deny the extension would abridge a constitutional right.” <span class="citation" data-id="1207031"><a href="/opinion/1207031/tharp-v-commonwealth/#3" aria-description="Citation for case: Tharp v.

Commonwealth">175 S. E. 2d, at 278</a></span>.</blockquote>
<p id="b811-8">Coleman contends that the Virginia Supreme Court’s exception for constitutional claims demonstrates that the court will conduct at least a cursory review of a petitioner’s constitutional claims on the merits before dismissing an appeal.</p>
<p id="b811-9">We are not convinced that <em><span class="citation" data-id="1207031"><a href="/opinion/1207031/tharp-v-commonwealth/" aria-description="Citation for case: Tharp v. Commonwealth">Tharp</a></span> </em>stands for the rule that Coleman believes it does. Coleman reads that case as establishing a practice in the Virginia Supreme Court of examining the merits of all underlying constitutional claims before denying a petition for appeal or writ of error as time barred. A more natural reading is that the Virginia Supreme Court will only grant an extension of time if <em>the denial itself </em>would <page-number citation-index="1" label="742">*742</page-number>abridge a constitutional right. That is, the Virginia Supreme Court will extend its time requirement only in those cases in which the petitioner has a constitutional right to have the appeal heard.</p>
<p id="b812-5">This was the case, for example, in <em>Cabaniss </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1220450"><a href="/opinion/1220450/cabaniss-v-cunningham/" aria-description="Citation for case: Cabaniss v.

E. 2d 911</a></span> (1965). Cabaniss had defaulted the direct appeal of his criminal conviction because the trial court had failed to honor his request for appointed counsel on appeal, a request the court was required to honor under the Constitution. See <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106546"><a href="/opinion/106546/douglas-v-california/" aria-description="Citation for case: Douglas v. California">372 U. S. 353</a></span> (1963). The Virginia Supreme Court, on state collateral review, ordered that Cabaniss be given counsel and allowed to file a new appeal, although grossly out of time. 206 Va., at 335, 143 S. E. 2d, at 914. Enforcing the time requirements for appeal in that case would have abridged Cabaniss’ constitutional right to counsel on appeal. See also <em>Thacker </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1364002"><a href="/opinion/1364002/thacker-v-peyton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Thacker v.

He does not contend that the failure of the Virginia Supreme Court to hear his untimely state habeas appeal violated one of his constitutional rights.</p>
<p id="b812-6">Even if we accept Coleman’s reading of <em><span class="citation" data-id="1207031"><a href="/opinion/1207031/tharp-v-commonwealth/" aria-description="Citation for case: Tharp v.

A petition for appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court is a document filed with that court in which the petitioner describes the alleged errors in the decision below. Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 5:17(c). It need only be filed within three months of the final judgment of a trial court. Rule 5:17(a)(1). By contrast, the notice of appeal is a document filed <em>with the trial court </em>that notifies that court and the Virginia Supreme Court, as well as the parties, that there will be an appeal; it is a purely ministerial document. Rule 5:9. The notice of the appeal must be filed within 30 <page-number citation-index="1" label="743">*743</page-number>days of the final judgment of the trial court. <em><span class="citation" data-id="1207031"><a href="/opinion/1207031/tharp-v-commonwealth/" aria-description="Citation for case: Tharp v.

We decline Coleman’s invitation to announce such a practice for that court.</p>
<p id="b814-5">Finally, Coleman argues that the Virginia Supreme Court’s dismissal order in this case is at least ambiguous because it was issued “[u]pon consideration” of all the filed papers, including Coleman’s petition for appeal and the Commonwealth’s brief in opposition, both of which discussed the merits of Coleman’s federal claims. There is no doubt that the Virginia Supreme Court’s “consideration” of all filed papers adds some ambiguity, but we simply cannot read it as overriding the court’s explicit grant of a dismissal motion based solely on procedural grounds. Those grounds are independent of federal law.</p>
<p id="b814-6">Coleman contends also that the procedural bar was not adequate to support the judgment. Coleman did not petition for certiorari on this question, and we therefore accept the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the bar was adequate.

<blockquote id="b818-5">“As Justice Harlan once observed, ‘[b]oth the individual criminal defendant and society have an interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation, and that attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community.’ <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106591"><a href="/opinion/106591/sanders-v-united-states/#24" aria-description="Citation for case: Sanders v.

We now recognize the important interest in finality served by state procedural rules, and the significant harm to the States that results from the failure of federal courts to respect them. Cf. <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Zant, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112573"><a href="/opinion/112573/mccleskey-v-zant/#491" aria-description="Citation for case: McCleskey v. Zant">499 U.

There is no reason that the same standard should not apply to a failure to appeal at all. All of the State’s interests —in channeling the resolution of claims to the most appropriate forum, in finality, and in having an opportunity to correct its own errors — are implicated whether a prisoner defaults one claim or all of them. A federal court generally should not interfere in either case. By applying the cause and prejudice standard uniformly to all independent and adequate state procedural <page-number citation-index="1" label="751">*751</page-number>defaults, we eliminate the irrational distinction between <em><span class="citation" data-id="106548"><a href="/opinion/106548/fay-v-noia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Fay v.

<p id="b821-5">We also eliminate inconsistency between the respect federal courts show for state procedural rules and the respect they show for their own.

Carrier">Carrier</a></span> </em>considered the circumstances under which attorney error constitutes cause. Carrier argued that his attorney’s inadvertence in failing to raise certain claims in his state appeal constituted cause for the default sufficient to allow federal habeas review. We rejected this claim, explaining that the costs associated with an ignorant or inadvertent procedural default are no less than where the failure to raise a claim is a deliberate strategy: It deprives the state courts of the opportunity to review trial errors. When a federal habeas court hears such a claim, it undercuts the State’s ability to enforce its procedural rules just as surely as when the default was deliberate. 477 U. S., at 487. We concluded: “So long as a defendant is represented by counsel whose performance is not constitutionally ineffective under the standard established in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>[<span class="citation" data-id="111170"><a href="/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/" aria-description="Citation for case: Strickland v.

<p id="b822-8">Applying the <em><span class="citation" data-id="111727"><a href="/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/" aria-description="Citation for case: Murray v. Carrier">Carrier</a></span> </em>rule as stated, this case is at an end. There is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings. <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Finley, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111880"><a href="/opinion/111880/pennsylvania-v-finley/" aria-description="Citation for case: Pennsylvania v.

Giarratano">492 U. S. 1</a></span> (1989) (applying the rule to capital cases). Consequently, a petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings. See <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Torna, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110666"><a href="/opinion/110666/wainwright-v-torna/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wainwright v. Torna">455 U. S. 586</a></span> (1982) (where there is no constitutional right to counsel there can be no deprivation of effective assistance). Coleman contends that it was his attorney’s error that led to the late filing of his state habeas appeal. This error cannot be constitutionally ineffective; therefore Coleman must “bear <page-number citation-index="1" label="753">*753</page-number>the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.”</p>
<p id="b823-5">Coleman attempts to avoid this reasoning by arguing that <em><span class="citation" data-id="111727"><a href="/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/" aria-description="Citation for case: Murray v. Carrier">Carrier</a></span> </em>does not stand for such a broad proposition. He contends that <em><span class="citation" data-id="111727"><a href="/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/" aria-description="Citation for case: Murray v. Carrier">Carrier</a></span> </em>applies by its terms only in those situations where it is possible to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Where there is no constitutional right to counsel, Coleman argues, it is enough that a petitioner demonstrate that his attorney’s conduct would meet the <em><span class="citation" data-id="111170"><a href="/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/" aria-description="Citation for case: Strickland v. Washington">Strickland</a></span> </em>standard, even though no independent Sixth Amendment claim is possible.</p>
<p id="b823-6">This argument is inconsistent not only with the language of <em><span class="citation" data-id="111727"><a href="/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/" aria-description="Citation for case: Murray v. Carrier">Carrier</a></span>, </em>but with the logic of that opinion as well. We explained clearly that “cause” under the cause and prejudice test must be something <em>external </em>to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him: “[W]e think that the existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel’s efforts to comply with the State’s procedural rule.” 477 U. S., at 488. For example, “a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel, ... or that ‘some interference by officials’ . . . made compliance impracticable, would constitute cause under this standard.” <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>id., </em>at 492 (“[Clause for a procedural default on appeal ordinarily requires a showing of some external impediment preventing counsel from constructing or raising the claim”).</p>
<p id="b823-7">Attorney ignorance or inadvertence is not “cause” because the attorney is the petitioner’s agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner must “bear the risk of attorney error.” <em>Id., </em>at 488. See <em>Link </em>v. <em>Wabash R. Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="106449"><a href="/opinion/106449/link-v-wabash-railroad/#634" aria-description="Citation for case: Link v.

Attor<page-number citation-index="1" label="754">*754</page-number>ney error that constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel is cause, however. This is not because, as Coleman contends, the error is so bad that “the lawyer ceases to be an agent of the petitioner.” Brief for Petitioner 29. In a case such as this, where the alleged attorney error is inadvertence in failing to file a timely notice, such a rule would be contrary to well-settled principles of agency law. See, <em>e. g., </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency § 242 (1958) (master is subject to liability for harm caused by negligent conduct of servant within the scope of employment). Rather, as <em><span class="citation" data-id="111727"><a href="/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/" aria-description="Citation for case: Murray v. Carrier">Carrier</a></span> </em>explains, “if the procedural default is the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Sixth Amendment itself requires that responsibility for the default be imputed to the State.” 477 U. S., at 488. In other words, it is not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters, but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to counsel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor, <em>i. e., </em>“imputed to the State.” See also <em>Evitts </em>v. <em>Lucey, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111302"><a href="/opinion/111302/evitts-v-lucey/#396" aria-description="Citation for case: Evitts v. Lucey">469 U. S. 387, 396</a></span> (1985) (“The constitutional mandate [guaranteeing effective assistance of counsel] is addressed to the action of the State in obtaining a criminal conviction through a procedure that fails to meet the standard of due process of law”).</p>
<p id="b824-5">Where a petitioner defaults a claim as a result of the denial of the right to effective assistance of counsel, the State, which is responsible for the denial as a constitutional matter, must bear the cost of any resulting default and the harm to state interests.that federal habeas review entails. A different allocation of costs is appropriate in those circumstances where the State has no responsibility to ensure that the petitioner was represented by competent counsel. As between the State and the petitioner, it is the petitioner who must bear- the burden of a failure to follow state procedural rules. In the absence of a constitutional violation, the petitioner bears the risk in federal habeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the representation, as <em><span class="citation" data-id="111727"><a href="/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/" aria-description="Citation for case: Murray v.

<p id="b825-5">Among the claims Coleman brought in state habeas, and then again in federal habeas, is ineffective assistance of counsel during trial, sentencing, and appeal. Coleman contends that, at least as to these claims, attorney error in state ha-beas must constitute cause. This is because, under Virginia law at the time of Coleman’s trial and direct appeal, ineffective assistance of counsel claims related to counsel’s conduct during trial or appeal could be brought only in state habeas. See <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1333232"><a href="/opinion/1333232/walker-v-mitchell/#571" aria-description="Citation for case: Walker v.

<p id="b825-6">We reiterate that counsel’s ineffectiveness will constitute cause only if it is an independent constitutional violation. <em><span class="citation" data-id="111880"><a href="/opinion/111880/pennsylvania-v-finley/" aria-description="Citation for case: Pennsylvania v.

Giarratano">Giarratano</a></span> </em>in those cases where state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction. • We need not answer this question broadly, however, for one state court has addressed Coleman’s claims: the state habeas trial court. The effectiveness of Coleman’s counsel before that court is not at issue here. Coleman contends that it was the ineffectiveness of his counsel during the appeal from that determination that constitutes cause to excuse his default. We thus need to decide only whether Coleman had a constitutional right to counsel on appeal from the state habeas trial court judgment. We conclude that he did not.</p>

We based our holding in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106546"><a href="/opinion/106546/douglas-v-california/" aria-description="Citation for case: Douglas v. California">Douglas</a></span> </em>on that “equality demanded by the Fourteenth Amendment.” 372 U. S., at 358. Recognizing that “[a]bsolute equality is not required,” we nonetheless held that “where the merits of <em>the one and only appeal </em>an indigent has as of right are decided without benefit of counsel, we think an unconstitutional line has been drawn between rich and poor.” <em>Id., </em>at 357 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p id="b826-5">Coleman has had his “one and only appeal,” if that is what a state collateral proceeding may be considered; the Buchanan County Circuit Court, after a 2-day evidentiary hearing, addressed Coleman’s claims of trial error, including his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. What Coleman requires here is a right to counsel on appeal from <em>that </em>determination. Our case law will not support it.</p>
<p id="b826-6">In <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Moffitt, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109070"><a href="/opinion/109070/ross-v-moffitt/" aria-description="Citation for case: Ross v. Moffitt">417 U.

Finley">481 U. S. 551</a></span> (1987), we declined to extend the right to counsel beyond the first appeal of a criminal conviction. We held in Ross that neither the fundamental fairness required by the Due Process Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee necessitated that States provide counsel in state discretionary appeals where defendants already had one appeal as of right. “The duty of the State under our cases is not to duplicate the legal arsenal that may be privately retained by a criminal defendant in a continuing effort to reverse his conviction, but only to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State’s appellate process.” <span class="citation" data-id="109070"><a href="/opinion/109070/ross-v-moffitt/#616" aria-description="Citation for case: Ross v.

Finley">481 U. S., at 556</a></span> (citing <em>Ross, supra).</em></p>
<p id="b826-7">These cases dictate the answer here. Given that a criminal defendant has no right to counsel beyond his first appeal in pursuing state discretionary or collateral review, it would defy logic for us to hold that Coleman had a right to counsel <page-number citation-index="1" label="757">*757</page-number>to appeal a state collateral determination of his claims of trial error.</p>
<p id="b827-3">Because Coleman had no right to counsel to pursue his appeal in state habeas, any attorney error that led to the default of Coleman’s claims in state court cannot constitute cause to excuse the default in federal habeas. As Coleman does not argue in this Court that federal review of his claims is necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice, he is barred from bringing these claims in federal habeas. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>

<footnote label="*">
<p id="b805-9"> This rule does not apply if the petitioner failed to exhaust state remedies and the court to which the petitioner would be required to present his claims in order to meet the exhaustion requirement would now find the claims procedurally barred.
