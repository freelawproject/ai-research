 [6] *54 The Eleventh Amendment provides: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State." Although the text of the Amendment would appear to restrict only the Article III diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts, "we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition.  .  .  which it confirms." Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779 (1991).  That presupposition, first observed over a century ago in Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890), has two parts: first, that each State is a sovereign entity in our federal system; and second, that "`[i]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent,' " <citedDecision>id., at 13</citedDecision> (emphasis deleted), quoting The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  See also Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, supra, at 146 ("The Amendment is rooted in a recognition that the States, although a union, maintain certain attributes of sovereignty, including sovereign immunity").  For over a century we have reaffirmed that federal jurisdiction over suits against unconsenting States "was not contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial power of the United States." <citedDecision>Hans, supra, at 15</citedDecision> .  [7] *55 Here, petitioner has sued the State of Florida and it is undisputed that Florida has not consented to the suit.  See Blatchford, supra, at 782 (States by entering into the Constitution did not consent to suit by Indian tribes).  Petitioner nevertheless contends that its suit is not barred by state sovereign immunity.  First, it argues that Congress through the Act abrogated the States' sovereign immunity.  Alternatively, petitioner maintains that its suit against the Governor may go forward under Ex parte Young, supra .  We consider each of those arguments in turn.

" Payne , supra, at 828 (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 407 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)).  The Court in Union Gas reached a result without an expressed rationale agreed upon by a majority of the Court. We have already seen that Justice Brennan's opinion received the support of only three other Justices.  See Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 5 (Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ., *64 joined Justice Brennan).  Of the other five, Justice White, who provided the fifth vote for the result, wrote separately in order to indicate his disagreement with the plurality's rationale, id. , at 57 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part), and four Justices joined together in a dissent that rejected the plurality's rationale, id., at 35-45 (Scalia, J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor and Kennedy, JJ.).  Since it was issued, Union Gas has created confusion among the lower courts that have sought to understand and apply the deeply fractured decision.  See, e. g., Chavez v. Arte Publico Press, supra, at 543-545 ("Justice White's concurrence must be taken on its face to disavow" the plurality's theory); 11 F. 3d, at 1027 (Justice White's "vague concurrence renders the continuing validity of Union Gas in doubt").  The plurality's rationale also deviated sharply from our established federalism jurisprudence and essentially eviscerated our decision in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> .  See Union Gas, supra, at 36 ("If <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> means only that federal-question suits for money damages against the States cannot be brought in federal court unless Congress clearly says so, it means nothing at all") (Scalia, J., dissenting).  It was well established in 1989 when Union Gas was decided that the Eleventh Amendment stood for the constitutional principle that state sovereign immunity limited the federal courts' jurisdiction under Article III. The text of the Amendment itself is clear enough on this point: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit .  .  .  ." And our decisions since <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> had been equally clear that the Eleventh Amendment reflects "the fundamental principle of sovereign immunity [that] limits the grant of judicial authority in Art. III," Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 97-98 (1984); see Union Gas, supra, at 38 ("`[T]he entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given .  .  .  ` ") (Scalia, *65 J., dissenting) (quoting Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 497 (1921)); see also cases cited at n. 7, supra. As the dissent in Union Gas recognized, the plurality's conclusionthat Congress could under Article I expand the scope of the federal courts' jurisdiction under Article III"contradict[ed] our unvarying approach to Article III as setting forth the exclusive catalog of permissible federal-court jurisdiction." Union Gas, supra, at 39.  Never before the decision in Union Gas had we suggested that the bounds of Article III could be expanded by Congress operating pursuant to any constitutional provision other than the Fourteenth Amendment.  Indeed, it had seemed fundamental that Congress could not expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts beyond the bounds of Article III. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803).

 .  . ").  It is true that we have not had occasion previously to apply established Eleventh Amendment principles to the question whether Congress has the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity (save in Union Gas ).  But consideration of that question must proceed with fidelity to this century-old doctrine.  The dissent, to the contrary, disregards our case law in favor of a theory cobbled together from law review articles and its own version of historical events.  The dissent cites not a single decision since <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> (other than Union Gas ) that supports its view of state sovereign immunity, instead relying upon the now-discredited decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793).  See, e. g., post, at 152, n. 47.  Its undocumented and highly speculative extralegal explanation of *69 the decision in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> is a disservice to the Court's traditional method of adjudication.  See post, at 120-123.  The dissent mischaracterizes the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> opinion.  That decision found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental "`jurisprudence in all civilized nations.' " Hans, <citedDecision>134 U. S., at 17</citedDecision> , quoting Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858); see also The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (sovereign immunity "is the general sense and the general practice of mankind").  The dissent's proposition that the common law of England, where adopted by the States, was open to change by the Legislature is wholly unexceptionable and largely beside the point: that common law provided the substantive rules of law rather than jurisdiction.  Cf. Monaco, supra, at 323 (state sovereign immunity, like the requirement that there be a "justiciable" controversy, is a constitutionally grounded limit on federal jurisdiction).  It also is noteworthy that the principle of state sovereign immunity stands distinct from other principles of the common law in that only the former prompted a specific constitutional amendment.  Hans with a much closer vantage point than the dissentrecognized that the decision in Chisholm was contrary to the well-understood meaning of the Constitution.  The dissent's conclusion that the decision in Chisholm was "reasonable," post, at 106, certainly would have struck the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment as quite odd: That decision created "such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted." Monaco, supra, at 325 .  The dissent's lengthy analysis of the text of the Eleventh Amendment is directed at a straw manwe long have recognized that blind reliance upon the text of the Eleventh Amendment is "`to strain the Constitution and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of.' " Monaco, supra, at 326 , quoting <citedDecision>Hans, supra, at 15</citedDecision> .  The text dealt in terms only with the problem presented by the decision in Chisholm ; in light of the fact that the federal courts did not *70 have federal-question jurisdiction at the time the Amendment was passed (and would not have it until 1875), it seems unlikely that much thought was given to the prospect of federal-question jurisdiction over the States.  That same consideration causes the dissent's criticism of the views of Marshall, Madison, and Hamilton to ring hollow.  The dissent cites statements made by those three influential Framers, the most natural reading of which would preclude all federal jurisdiction over an unconsenting State.  [12] Struggling against this reading, however, the dissent finds significant the absence of any contention that sovereign immunity would affect the new federal-question jurisdiction.  Post, at 142-150.  But the lack of any statute vesting general federal-question jurisdiction in the federal courts until much later makes the dissent's demand for greater specificity about a then-dormant jurisdiction overly exacting.

 IV The Eleventh Amendment prohibits Congress from making the State of Florida capable of being sued in federal court. The narrow exception to the Eleventh Amendment provided by the Ex parte Young doctrine cannot be used to enforce § 2710(d)(3) because Congress enacted a remedial scheme, § 2710(d)(7), specifically designed for the enforcement of that right.  The Eleventh Circuit's dismissal of petitioner's suit is hereby affirmed.  [18] It is so ordered.  Justice Stevens, dissenting.  This case is about powerthe power of the Congress of the United States to create a private federal cause of action against a State, or its Governor, for the violation of a federal right.  In Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), the entire Courtincluding Justice Iredell whose dissent provided the blueprint for the Eleventh Amendmentassumed that Congress had such power.  In Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890)a case the Court purports to follow todaythe Court *77 again assumed that Congress had such power.  In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), and Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 24 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring), the Court squarely held that Congress has such power.  In a series of cases beginning with Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 238-239 (1985), the Court formulated a special "clear statement rule" to determine whether specific Acts of Congress contained an effective exercise of that power.  Nevertheless, in a sharp break with the past, today the Court holds that with the narrow and illogical exception of statutes enacted pursuant to the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress has no such power.  The importance of the majority's decision to overrule the Court's holding in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co .  cannot be overstated.  The majority's opinion does not simply preclude Congress from establishing the rather curious statutory scheme under which Indian tribes may seek the aid of a federal court to secure a State's good-faith negotiations over gaming regulations.  Rather, it prevents Congress from providing a federal forum for a broad range of actions against States, from those sounding in copyright and patent law, to those concerning bankruptcy, environmental law, and the regulation of our vast national economy.  [1] *78 There may be room for debate over whether, in light of the Eleventh Amendment, Congress has the power to ensure that such a cause of action may be enforced in federal court by a citizen of another State or a foreign citizen.  There can be no serious debate, however, over whether Congress has the power to ensure that such a cause of action may be brought by a citizen of the State being sued.  Congress' authority in that regard is clear.  As Justice Souter has convincingly demonstrated, the Court's contrary conclusion is profoundly misguided.  Despite the thoroughness of his analysis, supported by sound reason, history, precedent, and strikingly uniform scholarly commentary, the shocking character of the majority's affront to a coequal branch of our Government merits additional comment.  I For the purpose of deciding this case, I can readily assume that Justice Iredell's dissent in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall., at 429-450 , and the Court's opinion in Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890), correctly stated the law that should govern our decision today.  As I shall explain, both of those opinions relied on an interpretation of an Act of Congress rather than a want of congressional power to authorize a suit against the State.  In concluding that the federal courts could not entertain Chisholm's action against the State of Georgia, Justice Iredell relied on the text of the Judiciary Act of 1789, not the State's assertion that Article III did not extend the judicial power to suits against unconsenting States.  Justice Iredell argued that, under Article III, federal courts possessed only *79 such jurisdiction as Congress had provided, and that the Judiciary Act expressly limited federal-court jurisdiction to that which could be exercised in accordance with "`the principles and usages of law.' " Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall., at 434 (quoting § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789).  He reasoned that the inclusion of this phrase constituted a command to the federal courts to construe their jurisdiction in light of the prevailing common law, a background legal regime that he believed incorporated the doctrine of sovereign immunity.  Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall., at 434-436 (dissenting opinion).  [2] Because Justice Iredell believed that the expansive text of Article III did not prevent Congress from imposing this common-law limitation on federal-court jurisdiction, he concluded that judges had no authority to entertain a suit against an unconsenting State.
**Combined Opinion**
 That provision's text specifically provides for federal-court jurisdiction over all cases arising under federal law. Moreover, as I have explained, Justice Iredell's dissent argued that it was the Judiciary Act of 1789, not Article III, that prevented the federal courts from entertaining Chisholm's diversity action against Georgia.  Therefore, Justice Iredell's analysis at least suggests that it was by no means a fixed view at the time of the founding that Article III prevented Congress from rendering States suable in federal court by their own citizens.  In sum, little more than speculation justifies the conclusion that the Eleventh Amendment's express but partial limitation on the scope of Article III reveals that an implicit but more general one was already in place.  II The majority appears to acknowledge that one cannot deduce from either the text of Article III or the plain terms of *84 the Eleventh Amendment that the judicial power does not extend to a congressionally created cause of action against a State brought by one of that State's citizens.  Nevertheless, the majority asserts that precedent compels that same conclusion.  I disagree.  The majority relies first on our decision in Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890), which involved a suit by a citizen of Louisiana against that State for a claimed violation of the Contracts Clause.  The majority suggests that by dismissing the suit, <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> effectively held that federal courts have no power to hear federal-question suits brought by same-state plaintiffs.  Hans does not hold, however, that the Eleventh Amendment, or any other constitutional provision, precludes federal courts from entertaining actions brought by citizens against their own States in the face of contrary congressional direction.  As I have explained before, see Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 25-26 (Stevens, J., concurring), and as Justice Souter effectively demonstrates, <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> instead reflects, at the most, this Court's conclusion that, as a matter of federal common law, federal courts should decline to entertain suits against unconsenting States.  Because <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> did not announce a constitutionally mandated jurisdictional bar, one need not overrule <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , or even question its reasoning, in order to conclude that Congress may direct the federal courts to reject sovereign immunity in those suits not mentioned by the Eleventh Amendment.  Instead, one need only follow it.  Justice Bradley's somewhat cryptic opinion for the Court in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> relied expressly on the reasoning of Justice Iredell's dissent in Chisholm , which, of course, was premised on the view that the doctrine of state sovereign immunity was a common-law rule that Congress had directed federal courts to respect, not a constitutional immunity that Congress was powerless to displace.  For that reason, Justice Bradley explained that the State's immunity from suit by one of its own *85 citizens was based not on a constitutional rule but rather on the fact that Congress had not, by legislation, attempted to overcome the common-law presumption of sovereign immunity.  His analysis so clearly supports the position rejected by the majority today that it is worth quoting at length.  "But besides the presumption that no anomalous and unheard of proceedings or suits were intended to be raised up by the Constitutionanomalous and unheard of when the Constitution was adoptedan additional reason why the jurisdiction claimed for the Circuit Court does not exist, is the language of the act of Congress by which its jurisdiction is conferred.  The words are these: `The circuit courts of the United States shall have original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several States, of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, .  .  .  arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties,' etc.'Concurrent with the courts of the several States.' Does not this qualification show that Congress, in legislating to carry the Constitution into effect, did not intend to invest its courts with any new and strange jurisdictions?  The state courts have no power to entertain suits by individuals against a State without its consent.  Then how does the Circuit Court, having only concurrent jurisdiction, acquire any such power?  It is true that the same qualification existed in the judiciary act of 1789, which was before the court in Chisholm v. Georgia , and the majority of the court did not think that it was sufficient to limit the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. Justice Iredell thought differently.  In view of the manner in which that decision was received by the country, the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, the light of history and the reason of the thing, we think we are at liberty to prefer Justice Iredell's views in this regard." <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S., at 18-19</citedDecision> .  *86 As this passage demonstrates, <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> itself looked to see whether Congress had displaced the presumption that sovereign immunity obtains.  Although the opinion did go to great lengths to establish the quite uncontroversial historical proposition that unconsenting States generally were not subject to suit, that entire discussion preceded the opinion's statutory analysis.  See <citedDecision>id., at 10-18</citedDecision> .  Thus, the opinion's thorough historical investigation served only to establish a presumption against jurisdiction that Congress must overcome, not an inviolable jurisdictional restriction that inheres in the Constitution itself.  Indeed, the very fact that the Court characterized the doctrine of sovereign immunity as a "presumption" confirms its assumption that it could be displaced.  The <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court's inquiry into congressional intent would have been wholly inappropriate if it had believed that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was a constitutionally inviolable jurisdictional limitation.  Thus, <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> provides no basis for the majority's conclusion that Congress is powerless to make States suable in cases not mentioned by the text of the Eleventh Amendment.  Instead, <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> provides affirmative support for the view that Congress may create federal-court jurisdiction over private causes of action against unconsenting States brought by their own citizens.  It is true that the underlying jurisdictional statute involved in this case, 28 U. S. C. § 1331 , does not itself purport to direct federal courts to ignore a State's sovereign immunity any more than did the underlying jurisdictional statute discussed in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , the Judiciary Act of 1875.  However, unlike in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , in this case Congress has, by virtue of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, affirmatively manifested its intention to "invest its courts with" jurisdiction beyond the limits set forth in the general jurisdictional statute.  <citedDecision>134 U. S., at 18</citedDecision> .  By contrast, because <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> involved only an implied cause of action based directly on the Constitution, the Judiciary Act of 1875 constituted the sole indication as *87 to whether Congress intended federal-court jurisdiction to extend to a suit against an unconsenting State.  [10] Given the nature of the cause of action involved in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , as well as the terms of the underlying jurisdictional statute, the Court's decision to apply the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity in that case clearly should not control the outcome here.  The reasons that may support a federal court's hesitancy to construe a judicially crafted constitutional remedy narrowly out of respect for a State's sovereignty do not bear on whether Congress may preclude a State's invocation of such a defense when it expressly establishes a federal remedy for the violation of a federal right.  No one has ever suggested that Congress would be powerless to displace the other common-law immunity doctrines that this Court has recognized as appropriate defenses to certain federal claims such as the judicially fashioned remedy in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 *88 U. S. 388 (1971).  See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982).  Similarly, our cases recognizing qualified officer immunity in 42 U. S. C. § 1983 actions rest on the conclusion that, in passing that statute, Congress did not intend to displace the common-law immunity that officers would have retained under suits premised solely on the general jurisdictional statute.  See Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 920 (1984).  For that reason, the federal common law of officer immunity that Congress meant to incorporate, not a contrary state immunity, applies in § 1983 cases. See Martinez v. California, 444 U. S. 277, 284 (1980).
**Combined Opinion**
 The majority offers no reason for making the federal common-law rule of sovereign immunity less susceptible to congressional displacement than any other quasijurisdictional common-law rule.  In this regard, I note that Monaco itself analogized sovereign immunity to the prudential doctrine that "controversies" identified in Article III must be "justiciable" in order to be heard by federal courts.  Id., at 329 .  The justiciability doctrine is a prudential rather than a jurisdictional one, and thus Congress' clearly expressed intention to create federal jurisdiction over a particular Article III controversy necessarily strips federal courts of the authority to decline jurisdiction on justiciability grounds.  See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 791 (1984) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Flast Cohen, v. 392 U. S. 83, 100-101 (1968).  For that reason, Monaco, by its own terms, fails to resolve the question before us.  [11] More generally, it is quite startling to learn that the reasoning of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> and Monaco (even assuming that it did not undermine the majority's view) should have a stare decisis effect on the question whether Congress possesses the authority to provide a federal forum for the vindication of a federal right by a citizen against its own State.  In light of the Court's development of a "clear-statement" line of jurisprudence, *90 see, e. g., Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 238-239 ; Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96 (1989), I would have thought that <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> and Monaco had at least left open the question whether Congress could permit the suit we consider here.  Our clear-statement cases would have been all but unintelligible if <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> and Monaco had already established that Congress lacked the constitutional power to make States suable in federal court by individuals no matter how clear its intention to do so. [12] Finally, the particular nature of the federal question involved in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> renders the majority's reliance upon its rule even less defensible.  <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> deduced its rebuttable presumption in favor of sovereign immunity largely on the basis of its extensive analysis of cases holding that the sovereign could not be forced to make good on its debts via a private suit.  See Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S. 711 (1883); Hagood v. Southern, 117 U. S. 52 (1886); In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443 (1887).  Because <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , like these other cases, involved a suit that attempted to make a State honor its debt, its holding need not be read to stand even for the relatively limited proposition that there is a presumption in favor of sovereign immunity in all federal-question cases. [13] *91 In <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , the plaintiff asserted a Contracts Clause claim against his State and thus asserted a federal right.  To show that Louisiana had impaired its federal obligation, however, Hans first had to demonstrate that the State had entered into an enforceable contract as a matter of state law. That Hans chose to bring his claim in federal court as a Contract Clause action could not change the fact that he was, at bottom, seeking to enforce a contract with the State.  See Burnham, Taming the Eleventh Amendment Without Overruling <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> v. Louisiana , 40 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 931 (1990).  Because Hans' claimed federal right did not arise independently of state law, sovereign immunity was relevant to the threshold state-law question of whether a valid contract existed.  [14] Hans expressly pointed out, however, that an individual who could show that he had an enforceable contract under state law would not be barred from bringing suit in federal court to prevent the State from impairing it.  "To avoid misapprehension it may be proper to add that, although the obligations of a State rest for their performance upon its honor and good faith, and cannot be made the subject of judicial cognizance unless the State consents to be sued, or comes itself into court; yet where property or rights are enjoyed under a grant or contract made by a State, they cannot wantonly be invaded.  Whilst the State cannot be compelled by suit to perform its contracts, any attempt on its part to violate property or rights acquired under its contracts, may be *92 judicially resisted; and any law impairing the obligation of contracts under which such property or rights are held is void and powerless to affect their enjoyment." <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S., at 20-21</citedDecision> .  That conclusion casts doubt on the absolutist view that <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> definitively establishes that Article III prohibits federal courts from entertaining federal-question suits brought against States by their own citizens.  At the very least, <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> suggests that such suits may be brought to enjoin States from impairing existing contractual obligations.  The view that the rule of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> is more substantive than jurisdictional comports with Hamilton's famous discussion of sovereign immunity in The Federalist Papers.  Hamilton offered his view that the federal judicial power would not extend to suits against unconsenting States only in the context of his contention that no contract with a State could be enforceable against the State's desire.  He did not argue that a State's immunity from suit in federal court would be absolute.  "[T]here is no color to pretend that the State governments would, by the adoption of [the plan of convention], be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith.  The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force.  They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will." The Federalist No. 81, p. 488 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Here, of course, no question of a State's contractual obligations is presented.  The Seminole Tribe's only claim is that the State of Florida has failed to fulfill a duty to negotiate that federal statutory law alone imposes.  Neither the Federalist *93 Papers, nor <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , provides support for the view that such a claim may not be heard in federal court. III In reaching my conclusion that the Constitution does not prevent Congress from making the State of Florida suable in federal court for violating one of its statutes, I emphasize that I agree with the majority that in all cases to which the judicial power does not extendeither because they are not within any category defined in Article III or because they are within the category withdrawn from Article III by the Eleventh AmendmentCongress lacks the power to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts.  As I have previously insisted: "A statute cannot amend the Constitution." Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 24 .  It was, therefore, misleading for the Court in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), to imply that § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment authorized Congress to confer jurisdiction over cases that had been withdrawn from Article III by the Eleventh Amendment.  Because that action had been brought by Connecticut citizens against officials of the State of Connecticut, jurisdiction was not precluded by the Eleventh Amendment.  As Justice Brennan pointed out in his concurrence, the congressional authority to enact the provisions at issue in the case was found in the Commerce Clause and provided a sufficient basis for refusing to allow the State to "avail itself of the nonconstitutional but ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity." Id., at 457 (opinion concurring in judgment).
**Combined Opinion**
 In a rather novel rejection of the doctrine of stare decisis, the Court today demeans that holding by repeatedly describing it as a "plurality decision" because Justice White did not deem it necessary to set forth the reasons for his vote.  As Justice Souter's opinion today demonstrates, the arguments in support of Justice White's position are so patent and so powerful that his actual vote should be accorded full respect.  Indeed, far more significant than the "plurality" character of the three opinions supporting the holding in Union Gas is the fact that the issue confronted today has been squarely addressed by a total of 13 Justices, 8 of whom cast their votes with the so-called "plurality." [15] *95 The fundamental error that continues to lead the Court astray is its failure to acknowledge that its modern embodiment of the ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity "has absolutely nothing to do with the limit on judicial power contained in the Eleventh Amendment." Id., at 25 (Stevens, J., concurring).  It rests rather on concerns of federalism and comity that merit respect but are nevertheless, in cases such as the one before us, subordinate to the plenary power of Congress.  IV As I noted above, for the purpose of deciding this case, it is not necessary to question the wisdom of the Court's decision in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> v. Louisiana .  Given the absence of precedent for the Court's dramatic application of the sovereign immunity doctrine today, it is nevertheless appropriate to identify the questionable heritage of the doctrine and to suggest that there are valid reasons for limiting, or even rejecting that doctrine altogether, rather than expanding it.  Except insofar as it has been incorporated into the text of the Eleventh Amendment, the doctrine is entirely the product of judge-made law. Three features of its English ancestry make it particularly unsuitable for incorporation into the law of this democratic Nation.  First, the assumption that it could be supported by a belief that "the King can do no wrong" has always been absurd; the bloody path trod by English monarchs both before and after they reached the throne demonstrated the fictional character of any such assumption.  Even if the fiction had been acceptable in Britain, the recitation in the Declaration of Independence of the wrongs committed by George III made that proposition unacceptable on this side of the Atlantic.  *96 Second, centuries ago the belief that the monarch served by divine right made it appropriate to assume that redress for wrongs committed by the sovereign should be the exclusive province of still higher authority.  [16] While such a justification for a rule that immunized the sovereign from suit in a secular tribunal might have been acceptable in a jurisdiction where a particular faith is endorsed by the government, it should give rise to skepticism concerning the legitimacy of comparable rules in a society where a constitutional wall separates the State from the Church.

 Second, Holmes's statement does not purport to explain why a general grant of jurisdiction to federal courts should not be treated as an adequate expression of the sovereign's consent to suits against itself as well as to suits against *98 ordinary litigants." Stevens, Is Justice Irrelevant?, 87 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1121 , 1126 (1993).  In sum, as far as its common-law ancestry is concerned, there is no better reason for the rule of sovereign immunity "than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV." Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457 , 469 (1897).  That "reason" for the perpetuation of this ancient doctrine certainly cannot justify the majority's expansion of it.  In this country the sovereignty of the individual States is subordinate both to the citizenry of each State and to the supreme law of the federal sovereign.  For that reason, Justice Holmes' explanation for a rule that allows a State to avoid suit in its own courts does not even speak to the question whether Congress should be able to authorize a federal court to provide a private remedy for a State's violation of federal law. In my view, neither the majority's opinion today, nor any earlier opinion by any Member of the Court, has identified any acceptable reason for concluding that the absence of a State's consent to be sued in federal court should affect the power of Congress to authorize federal courts to remedy violations of federal law by States or their officials in actions not covered by the Eleventh Amendment's explicit text.  [18] While I am persuaded that there is no justification for permanently enshrining the judge-made law of sovereign immunity, I recognize that federalism concernsand even the interest *99 in protecting the solvency of the States that was at work in Chisholm and <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> may well justify a grant of immunity from federal litigation in certain classes of cases. Such a grant, however, should be the product of a reasoned decision by the policymaking branch of our Government.  For this Court to conclude that timeworn shibboleths iterated and reiterated by judges should take precedence over the deliberations of the Congress of the United States is simply irresponsible.  V Fortunately, and somewhat fortuitously, a jurisdictional problem that is unmentioned by the Court may deprive its opinion of precedential significance.  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act establishes a unique set of procedures for resolving the dispute between the Tribe and the State.  If each adversary adamantly adheres to its understanding of the law, if the District Court determines that the State's inflexibility constitutes a failure to negotiate in good faith, and if the State thereafter continues to insist that it is acting within its rights, the maximum sanction that the Court can impose is an order that refers the controversy to a member of the Executive Branch of the Government for resolution.  25 U. S. C. § 2710 (d)(7)(B).  As the Court of Appeals interpreted the Act, this final disposition is available even though the action against the State and its Governor may not be maintained.

 See Gordon v. United States, 117 U. S. Appx. 697, 702-703 (1864) (opinion of Taney, C. J.); United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 48 (1852).  It may well follow that the misguided opinion of today's majority has nothing more than an advisory character.  Whether or not that be so, the better reasoning *100 in Justice Souter's far wiser and far more scholarly opinion will surely be the law one day. For these reasons, as well as those set forth in Justice Souter's opinion, I respectfully dissent.  Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.  In holding the State of Florida immune to suit under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, the Court today holds for the first time since the founding of the Republic that Congress has no authority to subject a State to the jurisdiction of a federal court at the behest of an individual asserting a federal right.  Although the Court invokes the Eleventh Amendment as authority for this proposition, the only sense in which that amendment might be claimed as pertinent here was tolerantly phrased by Justice Stevens in his concurring opinion in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 23 (1989).  There, he explained how it has come about that we have two Eleventh Amendments, the one ratified in 1795, the other (so-called) invented by the Court nearly a century later in Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890).  Justice Stevens saw in that second Eleventh Amendment no bar to the exercise of congressional authority under the Commerce Clause in providing for suits on a federal question by individuals against a State, and I can only say that after my own canvass of the matter I believe he was entirely correct in that view, for reasons given below.  His position, of course, was also the holding in Union Gas, which the Court now overrules and repudiates.  The fault I find with the majority today is not in its decision to reexamine Union Gas, for the Court in that case produced no majority for a single rationale supporting congressional authority.  Instead, I part company from the Court because I am convinced that its decision is fundamentally mistaken, and for that reason I respectfully dissent.  *101 I It is useful to separate three questions: (1) whether the States enjoyed sovereign immunity if sued in their own courts in the period prior to ratification of the National Constitution; (2) if so, whether after ratification the States were entitled to claim some such immunity when sued in a federal court exercising jurisdiction either because the suit was between a State and a nonstate litigant who was not its citizen, or because the issue in the case raised a federal question; and (3) whether any state sovereign immunity recognized in federal court may be abrogated by Congress.  The answer to the first question is not clear, although some of the Framers assumed that States did enjoy immunity in their own courts.  The second question was not debated at the time of ratification, except as to citizen-state diversity jurisdiction; [1] there was no unanimity, but in due course the Court in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), answered that a state defendant enjoyed no such immunity.  As to federal-question jurisdiction, state sovereign immunity seems not to have been debated prior to ratification, the silence probably showing a general understanding at the time that the States would have no immunity in such cases. The adoption of the Eleventh Amendment soon changed the result in Chisholm , not by mentioning sovereign immunity, but by eliminating citizen-state diversity jurisdiction over cases with state defendants.  I will explain why the *102 Eleventh Amendment did not affect federal-question jurisdiction, a notion that needs to be understood for the light it casts on the soundness of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> `s holding that States did enjoy sovereign immunity in federal-question suits.  The <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court erroneously assumed that a State could plead sovereign immunity against a noncitizen suing under federal-question jurisdiction, and for that reason held that a State must enjoy the same protection in a suit by one of its citizens.  The error of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> `s reasoning is underscored by its clear inconsistency with the Founders' hostility to the implicit reception of common-law doctrine as federal law, and with the Founders' conception of sovereign power as divided between the States and the National Government for the sake of very practical objectives.  The Court's answer today to the third question is likewise at odds with the Founders' view that common law, when it was received into the new American legal system, was always subject to legislative amendment.  In ignoring the reasons for this pervasive understanding at the time of the ratification, and in holding that a nontextual common-law rule limits a clear grant of congressional power under Article I, the Court follows a course that has brought it to grief before in our history, and promises to do so again.  Beyond this third question that elicits today's holding, there is one further issue.  To reach the Court's result, it must not only hold the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> doctrine to be outside the reach of Congress, but must also displace the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), that an officer of the government may be ordered prospectively to follow federal law, in cases in which the government may not itself be sued directly.  None of its reasons for displacing Young `s jurisdictional doctrine withstand scrutiny.  A The doctrine of sovereign immunity comprises two distinct rules, which are not always separately recognized.  The one rule holds that the King or the Crown, as the font of law, is *103 not bound by the law's provisions; the other provides that the King or Crown, as the font of justice, is not subject to suit in its own courts.  See, e. g., Jaffe, Suits Against Governments and Officers: Sovereign Immunity, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 1 , 3-4 (1963).  [2] The one rule limits the reach of substantive law; the other, the jurisdiction of the courts.  We are concerned here only with the latter rule, which took its common-law form in the high Middle Ages.

2 Dall., at 435 (emphasis deleted).  While in at least some circumstances States might be held liable to "the authority of the United States," id., at 436 , any such liability *109 would depend upon "laws passed under the Constitution and in conformity to it," ibid. [6] Finding no congressional action abrogating Georgia's common-law immunity, Justice Iredell concluded that the State should not be liable to suit.  [7] C The Eleventh Amendment, of course, repudiated Chisholm and clearly divested federal courts of some jurisdiction as to cases against state parties: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State." There are two plausible readings of this provision's text.  Under the first, it simply repeals the Citizen-State Diversity *110 Clauses of Article III for all cases in which the State appears as a defendant.  Under the second, it strips the federal courts of jurisdiction in any case in which a state defendant is sued by a citizen not its own, even if jurisdiction might otherwise rest on the existence of a federal question in the suit.  Neither reading of the Amendment, of course, furnishes authority for the Court's view in today's case, but we need to choose between the competing readings for the light that will be shed on the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> doctrine and the legitimacy of inflating that doctrine to the point of constitutional immutability as the Court has chosen to do.  The history and structure of the Eleventh Amendment convincingly show that it reaches only to suits subject to federal jurisdiction exclusively under the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses.  [8] In precisely tracking the language in Article III providing for citizen-state diversity jurisdiction, the text of the Amendment does, after all, suggest to common *111 sense that only the Diversity Clauses are being addressed.  If the Framers had meant the Amendment to bar federalquestion suits as well, they could not only have made their intentions clearer very easily, but could simply have adopted the first post- Chisholm proposal, introduced in the House of Representatives by Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts on instructions from the Legislature of that Commonwealth.  Its provisions would have had exactly that expansive effect: "[N]o state shall be liable to be made a party defendant, in any of the judicial courts, established, or which shall be established under the authority of the United States, at the suit of any person or persons, whether a citizen or citizens, or a foreigner or foreigners, or of any body politic or corporate, whether within or without the United States." Gazette of the United States 303 (Feb. 20, 1793).  With its references to suits by citizens as well as noncitizens, the Sedgwick amendment would necessarily have been applied beyond the Diversity Clauses, and for a reason that would have been wholly obvious to the people of the time.

 See Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 294 (Brennan, J., dissenting); Jackson, The Supreme Court, the Eleventh Amendment, and State Sovereign Immunity, 98 Yale L. J. 1, 44 (1988).  In sum, reading the Eleventh Amendment solely as a limit on citizen-state diversity jurisdiction has the virtue of coherence with this Court's practice, with the views of John Marshall, with the history of the Amendment's drafting, and with its allusive language.  Today's majority does not appear to disagree, at least insofar as the constitutional text is concerned; the Court concedes, after all, that "the text of the Amendment would appear to restrict only the Article III diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts." Ante, at 54.  [11] Thus, regardless of which of the two plausible readings one adopts, the further point to note here is that there is no possible argument that the Eleventh Amendment, by its terms, deprives federal courts of jurisdiction over all citizen lawsuits *115 against the States.  Not even the Court advances that proposition, and there would be no textual basis for doing so. [12] Because the plaintiffs in today's case are citizens of the *116 State that they are suing, the Eleventh Amendment simply does not apply to them.  We must therefore look elsewhere for the source of that immunity by which the Court says their suit is barred from a federal court. [13] II The obvious place to look elsewhere, of course, is Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890), and <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> was indeed a leap in the direction of today's holding, even though it does not take the Court all the way.  The parties in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> raised, and the Court in that case answered, only what I have called the second question, that is, whether the Constitution, without *117 more, permits a State to plead sovereign immunity to bar the exercise of federal-question jurisdiction.  See <citedDecision>id., at 9</citedDecision> .  Although the Court invoked a principle of sovereign immunity to cure what it took to be the Eleventh Amendment's anomaly of barring only those state suits brought by noncitizen plaintiffs, the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court had no occasion to consider whether Congress could abrogate that background immunity by statute.  Indeed (except in the special circumstance of Congress's power to enforce the Civil War Amendments), this question never came before our Court until Union Gas, and any intimations of an answer in prior cases were mere dicta.  In Union Gas the Court held that the immunity recognized in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> had no constitutional status and was subject to congressional abrogation.  Today the Court overrules Union Gas and holds just the opposite.  In deciding how to choose between these two positions, the place to begin is with <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> `s holding that a principle of sovereign immunity derived from the common law insulates a State from federal-question jurisdiction at the suit of its own citizen.  A critical examination of that case will show that it was wrongly decided, as virtually every recent commentator has concluded.  [14] It follows that the Court's further step today of constitutionalizing <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> `s rule against abrogation by Congress compounds and immensely magnifies the century-old mistake of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> itself and takes its place with other historic examples of textually untethered elevations of judicially derived rules to the status of inviolable constitutional law. A The Louisiana plaintiff in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> held bonds issued by that State, which, like virtually all of the Southern States, had issued them in substantial amounts during the Reconstruction era to finance public improvements aimed at stimulating *118 industrial development.  E. Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution 1863-1877, pp. 383-384 (1988); Gibbons, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 1976-1977.  As Reconstruction governments collapsed, however, the postReconstruction regimes sought to repudiate these debts, and the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> litigation arose out of Louisiana's attempt to renege on its bond obligations.  Hans sued the State in federal court, asserting that the State's default amounted to an impairment of the obligation of its contracts in violation of the Contract Clause.  This Court affirmed the dismissal of the suit, despite the fact that the case fell within the federal court's "arising under," or federal-question, jurisdiction.  Justice Bradley's opinion did not purport to hold that the terms either of Article III or of the Eleventh Amendment barred the suit, but that the ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity that had inspired adoption of the Eleventh Amendment applied to cases beyond the Amendment's scope and otherwise within the federalquestion jurisdiction.  Indeed, Bradley explicitly admitted that "[i]t is true, the amendment does so read [as to permit Hans's suit], and if there were no other reason or ground for abating his suit, it might be maintainable." Hans, <citedDecision>134 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> .  The Court elected, nonetheless, to recognize a broader immunity doctrine, despite the want of any textual manifestation, because of what the Court described as the anomaly that would have resulted otherwise: the Eleventh Amendment (according to the Court) would have barred a federal-question suit by a noncitizen, but the State would have been subject to federal jurisdiction at its own citizen's behest.  <citedDecision>Id., at 10-11</citedDecision> .  The State was accordingly held to be free to resist suit without its consent, which it might grant or withhold as it pleased.  Hans thus addressed the issue implicated (though not directly raised) in the preratification debate about the CitizenState Diversity Clauses and implicitly settled by Chisholm : whether state sovereign immunity was cognizable by federal *119 courts on the exercise of federal-question jurisdiction.  According to <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , and contrary to Chisholm , it was.  But that is all that <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> held.  Because no federal legislation purporting to pierce state immunity was at issue, it cannot fairly be said that <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> held state sovereign immunity to have attained some constitutional status immunizing it from abrogation.  [15] Taking <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> only as far as its holding, its vulnerability is apparent.  The Court rested its opinion on avoiding the supposed anomaly of recognizing jurisdiction to entertain a citizen's federal-question suit, but not one brought by a noncitizen.  See <citedDecision>Hans, supra, at 10-11</citedDecision> .  There was, however, no such anomaly at all. As already explained, federalquestion cases are not touched by the Eleventh Amendment, which leaves a State open to federal-question suits by citizens and noncitizens alike.  If Hans had been from Massachusetts the Eleventh Amendment would not have barred his action against Louisiana.  Although there was thus no anomaly to be cured by <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , the case certainly created its own anomaly in leaving federal courts entirely without jurisdiction to enforce paramount federal law at the behest of a citizen against a State that broke it.  It destroyed the congruence of the judicial power under Article III with the substantive guarantees of the Constitution, and with the provisions of statutes passed by Congress in the exercise of its power under Article I: when a State injured an individual in violation of federal law no federal forum could provide direct relief.  Absent an alternative process to vindicate federal law (see Part IV, infra ) John Marshall saw just what the consequences of this anomaly would be in the early Republic, and he took that consequence as good evidence that the Framers could never have intended such a scheme.  *120 "Different States may entertain different opinions on the true construction of the constitutional powers of congress.  We know that, at one time, the assumption of the debts contracted by the several States, during the war of our Revolution, was deemed unconstitutional by some of them.  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 States may legislate in conformity to their opinions, and may enforce those opinions by penalties.  It would be hazarding too much to assert that the judicatures of the States will be exempt from the prejudices by which the legislatures and people are influenced, and will constitute perfectly impartial tribunals.  In many States the judges are dependent for office and for salary on the will of the legislature.  The constitution of the United States furnishes no security against the universal adoption of this principle.  When we observe the importance which that constitution attaches to the independence of judges, we are the less inclined to suppose that it can have intended to leave these constitutional questions to tribunals where this independence may not exist." Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat., at 386-387 .  And yet that is just what <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> threatened to do.  How such a result could have been threatened on the basis of a principle not so much as mentioned in the Constitution is difficult to understand.  But history provides the explanation.  As I have already said, <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> was one episode in a long story of debt repudiation by the States of the former Confederacy after the end of Reconstruction.  The turning point in the States' favor came with the Compromise of 1877, when the Republican Party agreed effectively to end Reconstruction and to withdraw federal troops from the South in return for Southern acquiescence in the decision of the Electoral Commission that awarded the disputed 1876 presidential election to Rutherford B. Hayes.  See J. Orth, Judicial Power of the United States: The Eleventh Amendment in American History 53-57 (1987); Gibbons, supra, at 1978 *121 1982; see generally Foner, Reconstruction, at 575-587 (describing the events of 1877 and their aftermath).  The troop withdrawal, of course, left the federal judiciary "effectively without power to resist the rapidly coalescing repudiation movement." Gibbons, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 1981.  Contract Clause suits like the one brought by Hans thus presented this Court with "a draconian choice between repudiation of some of its most inviolable constitutional doctrines and the humiliation of seeing its political authority compromised as its judgments met the resistance of hostile state governments." Id., at 1974.  Indeed, Louisiana's brief in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> unmistakably bore witness to this Court's inability to enforce a judgment against a recalcitrant State: "The solemn obligation of a government arising on its own acknowledged bond would not be enhanced by a judgment rendered on such bond. If it either could not or would not make provision for paying the bond, it is probable that it could not or would not make provision for satisfying the judgment." Brief for Respondent in No. 4, O. T. 1889, p. 25.  Given the likelihood that a judgment against the State could not be enforced, it is not wholly surprising that the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court found a way to avoid the certainty of the State's contempt.  [16] *122 So it is that history explains, but does not honor, <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> .  The ultimate demerit of the case centers, however, not on its politics but on the legal errors on which it rested.  [17] Before *123 considering those errors, it is necessary to address the Court's contention that subsequent cases have read into <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> what was not there to begin with, that is, a background principle of sovereign immunity that is constitutional in stature and therefore unalterable by Congress.  B The majority does not dispute the point that Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890), had no occasion to decide whether Congress could abrogate a State's immunity from federalquestion suits.  The Court insists, however, that the negative answer to that question that it finds in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> and subsequent opinions is not "mere obiter dicta, but rather .  .  .  the well-established rationale upon which the Court based the results of its earlier decisions." Ante, at 66-67.  The exact rationale to which the majority refers, unfortunately, is not easy to discern.  The Court's opinion says, immediately after its discussion of stare decisis, that "[f]or over a century, we have grounded our decisions in the oft-repeated understanding of state sovereign immunity as an essential part of the Eleventh Amendment." Ante, at 67.  This cannot be the "rationale," though, because this Court has repeatedly acknowledged that the Eleventh Amendment standing alone *124 cannot bar a federal-question suit against a State brought by a state citizen.  See, e. g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 662 (1974) (acknowledging that "the Amendment by its terms does not bar suits against a State by its own citizens").  [18] Indeed, as I have noted, Justice Bradley's opinion in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> conceded that Hans might successfully have pursued his claim "if there were no other reason or ground [other than the Amendment itself] for abating his suit." <citedDecision>134 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> .  The <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court, rather, held the suit barred by a nonconstitutional common-law immunity.  See supra, at 116-117.  The "rationale" which the majority seeks to invoke is, I think, more nearly stated in its quotation from Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 321-323 (1934).  There, the Court said that "we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of § 2 of Article III, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against non-consenting States." Id., at 322.  [19] This statement certainly is true to <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , which *125 clearly recognized a pre-existing principle of sovereign immunity, broader than the Eleventh Amendment itself, that will ordinarily bar federal-question suits against a nonconsenting State.  That was the "rationale" which was sufficient to decide <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> and all of its progeny prior to Union Gas.  But leaving aside the indefensibility of that rationale, which I will address further below, that was as far as it went.  The majority, however, would read the "rationale" of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> and its line of subsequent cases as answering the further question whether the "postulate" of sovereign immunity that "limit[s] and control[s]" the exercise of Article III jurisdiction, Monaco, supra, at 322 , is constitutional in stature and therefore unalterable by Congress.  It is true that there are statements in the cases that point toward just this conclusion.  See, e. g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984) ("In short, the principle of sovereign immunity is a constitutional limitation on the federal judicial power established in Art. III"); Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 497 (1921) ("[T]he entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given .  .  . ").  These statements, however, are dicta in the classic sense, that is, sheer speculation about what would happen in cases not before the court. [20] But this *126 is not the only weakness of these statements, which are counterbalanced by many other opinions that have either stated the immunity principle without more, see, e. g., Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 229, n. 2 (1989) (noting that "an unconsenting State is immune from liability for damages in a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens," without suggesting that the immunity was unalterable by Congress), [21] or have suggested that the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> immunity is not of constitutional stature.  The very language quoted by the majority from Monaco, for example, likens state sovereign immunity to other "essential postulates" such as the rules of justiciability.  292 U. S., at 322 .  Many of those rules, as Justice Stevens points out, are prudential in nature and therefore not unalterable by Congress.  See ante, at 88-90.  [22] More generally, the proponents of the Court's theory have repeatedly referred to state sovereign immunity as a "background principle," ante, at 72, "postulate," Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 437 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), or "implicit limitation," Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468, 496 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and as resting on the "inherent nature of sovereignty," Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), rather than any explicit constitutional *127 provision.  [23] But whatever set of quotations one may prefer, taking heed of such jurisprudential creations in assessing the contents of federal common law is a very different thing from reading them into the Founding Document itself.  The most damning evidence for the Court's theory that <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> rests on a broad rationale of immunity unalterable by Congress, however, is the Court's proven tendency to disregard the post- <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> dicta in cases where that dicta would have mattered.  [24] If it is indeed true that "private suits against States [are] not permitted under Article III (by virtue of the understanding represented by the Eleventh Amendment)," Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 40 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), then it is hard to see how a State's sovereign immunity may be waived any more than it may be abrogated by Congress.  See, e. g., Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 238 (recognizing that immunity may be waived).  After all, consent of a party is in all other instances wholly insufficient to create subjectmatter *128 jurisdiction where it would not otherwise exist.  See, e. g., Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 398 (1975); see also E. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction § 7.6, p. 405 (2d ed. 1994) (noting that "allowing such waivers seems inconsistent with viewing the Eleventh Amendment as a restriction on the federal courts' subject matter jurisdiction").  Likewise, the Court's broad theory of immunity runs doubly afoul of the appellate jurisdiction problem that I noted earlier in rejecting an interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment's text that would bar federal-question suits.  See supra, at 109-116.  If "the whole sum of the judicial power granted by the Constitution to the United States does not embrace the authority to entertain a suit brought by a citizen against his own State without its consent," Duhne v. New Jersey, 251 U. S. 311, 313 (1920), and if consent to suit in state court is not sufficient to show consent in federal court, see Atascadero, supra, at 241 , then Article III would hardly permit this Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction over issues of federal law arising in lawsuits brought against the States in their own courts.  We have, however, quite rightly ignored any post- <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> dicta in that sort of case and exercised the jurisdiction that the plain text of Article III provides.  See, e. g., Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325 (1996); see also supra, at 113-114.  If these examples were not enough to distinguish <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> `s rationale of a pre-existing doctrine of sovereign immunity from the post- <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> dicta indicating that this immunity is constitutional, one would need only to consider a final set of cases: those in which we have assumed, without deciding, that congressional power to abrogate state sovereign immunity exists even when § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment has no application.  A majority of this Court was willing to make that assumption in Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96, 101 (1989) (plurality opinion), in Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., supra, at 475 (plurality opinion), and in County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226 , 252 *129 (1985).  [25] Although the Court in each of these cases failed to find abrogation for lack of a clear statement of congressional intent, the assumption that such power was available would hardly have been permissible if, at that time, today's majority's view of the law had been firmly established.  It is one thing, after all, to avoid an open constitutional question by assuming an answer and rejecting the claim on another ground; it is quite another to avoid a settled rationale (an emphatically settled one if the majority is to be taken seriously) only to reach an issue of statutory construction that the Court would otherwise not have to decide.  Even worse, the Court could not have been unaware that its decision of cases like Hoffman and Welch , on the ground that the statutes at issue lacked a plain statement of intent to abrogate, would invite Congress to attempt abrogation in statutes like the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U. S. C. § 2701 et seq. (IGRA).  Such a course would have been wholly irresponsible if, as the majority now claims, the constitutionally unalterable nature of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> immunity had been well established for a hundred years.  Hans itself recognized that an "observation [in a prior case that] was unnecessary to the decision, and in that sense extra judicial .  .  .  ought not to outweigh" present reasoning that points to a different conclusion.  <citedDecision>134 U. S., at 20</citedDecision> .  That is good advice, which Members of today's majority have been willing to heed on other occasions.  See, e. g., Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U. S. 375, 379 (1994) ("It is to the holdings of our cases, rather than their dicta, that we *130 must attend"); Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 450 (1996).  But because the Court disregards this norm today, I must consider the soundness of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> `s original recognition of a background principle of sovereign immunity that applies even in federal-question suits, and the reasons that counsel against the Court's extension of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> `s holding to the point of rendering its immunity unalterable by Congress.  III Three critical errors in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> weigh against constitutionalizing its holding as the majority does today.  The first we have already seen: the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court misread the Eleventh Amendment, see supra, at 118-123.  It also misunderstood the conditions under which common-law doctrines were received or rejected at the time of the founding, and it fundamentally mistook the very nature of sovereignty in the young Republic that was supposed to entail a State's immunity to federal-question jurisdiction in a federal court. While I would not, as a matter of stare decisis, overrule <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> today, an understanding of its failings on these points will show how the Court today simply compounds already serious error in taking <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> the further step of investing its rule with constitutional inviolability against the considered judgment of Congress to abrogate it.  A There is and could be no dispute that the doctrine of sovereign immunity that <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> purported to apply had its origins in the "familiar doctrine of the common law," The Siren, 7 Wall. 152, 153 (1869), "derived from the laws and practices of our English ancestors," United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196, 205 (1882).  [26] Although statutes came to affect its importance *131 in the succeeding centuries, the doctrine was never reduced to codification, and Americans took their understanding of immunity doctrine from Blackstone, see 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, ch. 17 (1768).  Here, as in the mother country, it remained a common-law rule.  See generally Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 2-19; Borchard, Governmental Responsibility in Tort, VI, 36 Yale L. J. 1, 17-41 (1926).  This fact of the doctrine's common-law status in the period covering the founding and the later adoption of the Eleventh Amendment should have raised a warning flag to the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court and it should do the same for the Court today.  For although the Court has persistently assumed that the common law's presence in the minds of the early Framers must *132 have functioned as a limitation on their understanding of the new Nation's constitutional powers, this turns out not to be so at all. One of the characteristics of the founding generation, on the contrary, was its joinder of an appreciation of its immediate and powerful common-law heritage with caution in settling that inheritance on the political systems of the new Republic.  It is not that the Framers failed to see themselves to be children of the common law; as one of their contemporaries put it, "[w]e live in the midst of the common law, we inhale it at every breath, imbibe it at every pore .  .  .  [and] cannot learn another system of laws without learning at the same time another language." P. Du Ponceau, A Dissertation on the Nature and Extent of Jurisdiction of Courts of the United States 91 (1824).  But still it is clear that the adoption of English common law in America was not taken for granted, and that the exact manner and extent of the common law's reception were subject to careful consideration by courts and legislatures in each of the new States.  [27] An examination of the States' experience with common-law reception will shed light on subsequent theory and practice at the national level, and demonstrate that our history is entirely at odds with <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> `s resort to a common-law principle to limit the Constitution's contrary text.  1 This American reluctance to import English common law wholesale into the New World is traceable to the early colonial period.  One scholar of that time has written that "[t]he *133 process which we may call the reception of the English common law by the colonies was not so simple as the legal theory would lead us to assume.  While their general legal conceptions were conditioned by, and their terminology derived from, the common law, the early colonists were far from applying it as a technical system, they often ignored it or denied its subsidiary force, and they consciously departed from many of its most essential principles." P. Reinsch, English Common Law in the Early American Colonies 58 (1899).  [28] For a variety of reasons, including the absence of trained lawyers and judges, the dearth of law books, the religious and ideological commitments of the early settlers, and the novel conditions of the New World, the colonists turned to a variety of other sources in addition to principles of common law. [29] It is true that, with the development of colonial society and the increasing sophistication of the colonial bar, English common law gained increasing acceptance in colonial practice.  See <citedDecision>id., at 7-8</citedDecision> ; Hall, The Common Law: An Account of its Reception in the United States, 4 Vand. L. Rev. 791 , *134 797 (1951).  [30] But even in the late colonial period, Americans insisted that "the whole body of the common law ... was not transplanted, but only so much as was applicable to the colonists in their new relations and conditions.  Much of the common law related to matters which were purely local, which existed under the English political organization, or was based upon the triple relation of king, lords and commons, or those peculiar social conditions, habits and customs which have no counterpart in the New World.  Such portions of the common law, not being applicable to the new conditions of the colonists, were never recognised as part of their jurisprudence." Dale, The Adoption of the Common Law by the American Colonies, 30 Am. L. Reg. 553, 554 (1882).  [31] The result was that "the increasing influx of common-law principles by no means obliterated the indigenous systems which had developed during the colonial era and that there existed important differences inlaw in action on the two sides of the Atlantic." Hall, supra, at 797.

 ").  Madison concluded that "[i]t is .  .  .  distressing to reflect that it ever should have been made a question, whether the Constitution, on the whole face of which is seen so much labor to enumerate and define the several objects of Federal power, could intend to introduce in the lump, in an indirect manner, and by a forced construction of a few phrases, the vast and multifarious jurisdiction involved in the common lawa law filling so many ample volumes; a law overspreading the entire field of legislation; and a law that would sap the foundation of the Constitution as a system of limited and specified powers." Alien and Sedition Laws 382.  B Given the refusal to entertain any wholesale reception of common law, given the failure of the new Constitution to make any provision for adoption of common law as such, and given the protests already quoted that no general reception had occurred, the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court and the Court today cannot reasonably argue that something like the old immunity doctrine somehow slipped in as a tacit but enforceable background principle.  But see ante, at 72.  The evidence is even more specific, however, that there was no pervasive understanding that sovereign immunity had limited federalquestion jurisdiction.  1 As I have already noted briefly, see supra, at 105-106, the Framers and their contemporaries did not agree about the *143 place of common-law state sovereign immunity even as to federal jurisdiction resting on the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses.  Edmund Randolph argued in favor of ratification on the ground that the immunity would not be recognized, leaving the States subject to jurisdiction.  [38] Patrick Henry opposed ratification on the basis of exactly the same reading.  See 3 Elliot's Debates 543.
**Combined Opinion**
The Federalist No. 81, at 548.  Hamilton is plainly talking about a *145 suit subject to a federal court's jurisdiction under the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses of Article III. The general statement on sovereign immunity emphasized by the majority then follows, along with a reference back to The Federalist No. 32.  The Federalist No. 81, at 548.  What Hamilton draws from that prior paper, however, is not a general conclusion about state sovereignty but a particular point about state contracts: "A recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us, that there is no colour to pretend that the state governments, would by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith.  The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force.  They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will." Id., at 549.  The most that can be inferred from this is, as noted above, that in diversity cases applying state contract law the immunity that a State would have enjoyed in its own courts is carried into the federal court. When, therefore, the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court relied in part upon Hamilton's statement, see <citedDecision>134 U. S., at 20</citedDecision> , its reliance was misplaced; Hamilton was addressing diversity jurisdiction, whereas <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> involved federal-question jurisdiction under the Contracts Clause.  No general theory of federal-question immunity can be inferred from Hamilton's discussion of immunity in contract suits.  But that is only the beginning of the difficulties that accrue to the majority from reliance on The Federalist No. 81.  Hamilton says that a State is "not .  .  .  amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent .
**Combined Opinion**
 [51] The Framers' principal objectives in rejecting English theories of unitary sovereignty, moreover, would have been impeded if a new concept of sovereign immunity had taken its place in federal-question cases, and would have been substantially thwarted if that new immunity had been held to be untouchable by any congressional effort to abrogate it.  [52] *158 Today's majority discounts this concern.  Without citing a single source to the contrary, the Court dismisses the historical evidence regarding the Framers' vision of the relationship between national and state sovereignty, and reassures us that "the Nation survived for nearly two centuries without the question of the existence of [the abrogation] power ever being presented to this Court." Ante, at 71.  [53] But we are concerned here not with the survival of the Nation but the opportunity of its citizens to enforce federal rights in a way that Congress provides.  The absence of any general federal-question statute for nearly a century following ratification of Article III (with a brief exception in 1800) hardly counts against the importance of that jurisdiction either in the Framers' conception or in current reality; likewise, the fact that Congress has not often seen fit to use its power of abrogation (outside the Fourteenth Amendment context, at least) does not compel a conclusion that the power is not important to the federal scheme.  In the end, is it plausible *159 to contend that the plan of the convention was meant to leave the National Government without any way to render individuals capable of enforcing their federal rights directly against an intransigent State?  C The considerations expressed so far, based on text, Chisholm , caution in common-law reception, and sovereignty theory, have pointed both to the mistakes inherent in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> and, even more strongly, to the error of today's holding.  Although for reasons of stare decisis I would not today disturb the century-old precedent, I surely would not extend its error by placing the common-law immunity it mistakenly recognized beyond the power of Congress to abrogate.  In doing just that, however, today's decision declaring state sovereign immunity itself immune from abrogation in federal-question cases is open to a further set of objections peculiar to itself.  For today's decision stands condemned alike by the Framers' abhorrence of any notion that such common-law rules as might be received into the new legal systems would be beyond the legislative power to alter or repeal, and by its resonance with this Court's previous essays in constitutionalizing common-law rules at the expense of legislative authority.  1 I have already pointed out how the views of the Framers reflected the caution of state constitutionalists and legislators over reception of common-law rules, a caution that the Framers exalted to the point of vigorous resistance to any idea that English common-law rules might be imported wholesale through the new Constitution.  The state politicians also took pains to guarantee that once a common-law rule had been received, it would always be subject to legislative alteration, and again the state experience was reflected in the Framers' thought.  Indeed, the Framers' very insistence *160 that no common-law doctrine would be received by virtue of ratification was focused in their fear that elements of the common law might thereby have been placed beyond the power of Congress to alter by legislation.

N. J. Const., Art. XXII (1776), in 6 W. Swindler, Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions 452 (1976).  [55] Just as the early state *162 governments did not leave reception of the common law to implication, then, neither did they receive it as law immune to legislative alteration.  [56] *163 I have already indicated that the Framers did not forget the state-law examples.  When Anti federalists objected that the 1787 draft failed to make an explicit adoption of certain common-law protections of the individual, part of the Federalists' answer was that a general constitutional reception of the common law would bar congressional revision.  Madison was particularly concerned with the necessity for legislative control, noting in a letter to George Washington that "every State has made great inroads & with great propriety on this monarchical code." Letter from James Madison to George Washington (Oct. 18, 1787), reprinted in 3 Farrand 130, App. A (emphasis in original).  [57] Madison went on to insist that *164 "[t]he Common law is nothing more than the unwritten law, and is left by all the Constitutions equally liable to legislative alterations." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> [58] Indeed, Madison anticipated, and rejected, the Court's approach today when he wrote that if "the common law be admitted as .  .  .  of constitutional obligation, it would confer on the judicial department a discretion little short of a legislative power .  .  .  [which] would be permanent and irremediable by the Legislature."

 .. If, on the other hand, the Legislature of the Union, or the Legislature of any member of the Union, shall pass a law, within the general scope of their constitutional power, the Court cannot pronounce it to be void, merely because it is, in their judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice.  The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard: the ablest and the purest men have differed upon the subject; and all that the Court could properly say, in such an event, would be, that the Legislature (possessed of an equal right of opinion) had passed an act which, in the opinion of the judges, was inconsistent with the abstract principles of natural justice." Id., at 398-399 (emphasis deleted) (opinion dissenting in part).  Later jurisprudence vindicated Justice Iredell's view, and the idea that "first principles" or concepts of "natural justice" might take precedence over the Constitution or other positive law "all but disappeared in American discourse." J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 52 (1980).  It should take more than references to "background principle[s]," ante, at 72, and "implicit limitation[s]," Welch, 483 U. S., at 496 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), to revive the judicial power to overcome clear text unopposed to any other provision, when that clear text is in harmony with an almost equally clear intent on the part of the Framers and the constitutionalists of their generation.  *169 IV The Court's holding that the States' <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> immunity may not be abrogated by Congress leads to the final question in this case, whether federal-question jurisdiction exists to order prospective relief enforcing IGRA against a state officer, respondent Chiles, who is said to be authorized to take the action required by the federal law. Just as with the issue about authority to order the State as such, this question is entirely jurisdictional, and we need not consider here whether petitioner Seminole Tribe would have a meritorious argument for relief, or how much practical relief the requested order (to bargain in good faith) would actually provide to the Tribe.  Nor, of course, does the issue turn in any way on one's views about the scope of the Eleventh Amendment or <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> and its doctrine, for we ask whether the state officer is subject to jurisdiction only on the assumption that action directly against the State is barred.  The answer to this question is an easy yes, the officer is subject to suit under the rule in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), and the case could, and should, readily be decided on this point alone.  A In Ex parte Young, this Court held that a federal court has jurisdiction in a suit against a state officer to enjoin official actions violating federal law, even though the State itself may be immune.  Under Young , "a federal court, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, may enjoin state officials to conform their future conduct to the requirements of federal law." Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 337 (1979); see also Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 289 (1977).  The fact, without more, that such suits may have a significant impact on state governments does not count under Young.  Milliken, for example, was a suit, under the authority of Young , brought against Michigan's Governor, Attorney General, Board of Education, Superintendent of Public Instruction, *170 and Treasurer, which resulted in an order obligating the State of Michigan to pay money from its treasury to fund an education plan.  The relief requested (and obtained) by the plaintiffs effectively ran against the State: state moneys were to be removed from the state treasury, and they were to be spent to fund a remedial education program that it would be the State's obligation to implement.  To take another example, Quern v. Jordan involved a court order requiring state officials to notify welfare beneficiaries of the availability of past benefits.  Once again, the defendants were state officials, but it was the obligation of the State that was really at issue: the notices would be sent from the state welfare agency, to be returned to the state agency, and the state agency would pay for the notices and any ensuing awards of benefits.  Indeed, in the years since Young was decided, the Court has recognized only one limitation on the scope of its doctrine: under Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974), Young permits prospective relief only and may not be applied to authorize suits for retrospective monetary relief.  It should be no cause for surprise that Young itself appeared when it did in the national law. It followed as a matter of course after the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court's broad recognition of immunity in federal-question cases, simply because "[r]emedies designed to end a continuing violation of federal law are necessary to vindicate the federal interest in assuring the supremacy of that law." Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68 (1985).  Young provided, as it does today, a sensible way to reconcile the Court's expansive view of immunity expressed in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> with the principles embodied in the Supremacy Clause and Article III. If Young may be seen as merely the natural consequence of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , it is equally unsurprising as an event in the longer history of sovereign immunity doctrine, for the rule we speak of under the name of Young isso far inherent in the jurisdictional limitation imposed by sovereign immunity as to have been recognized since the Middle Ages.  For that *171 long it has been settled doctrine that suit against an officer of the Crown permitted relief against the government despite the Crown's immunity from suit in its own courts and the maxim that the King could do no wrong.  See Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 3, 18-19; Ehrlich, No. XII: Proceedings Against the Crown (1216-1377), pp. 28-29, in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History (P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921).  An early example, from "time immemorial" of a claim "affecting the Crown [that] could be pursued in the regular courts [without consent since it]did not take the form of a suit against the Crown," Jaffe, supra, at 1, was recognized by the Statute of Westminster I, 1275, which established a writ of disseisin against a King's officers.  When a King's officer disseised any person in the King's name, the wrongfully deprived party could seek the draconian writ of attaint against the officer, by which he would recover his land.  Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 9.  Following this example forward, we may see how the writ of attaint was ultimately overtaken by the more moderate common-law writs of certiorari and mandamus, "operat[ing] directly on the government; [and commanding] an officer not as an individual but as a functionary." Id., at 16.  Thus the Court of King's Bench made it clear in 1701 that "wherever any new jurisdiction is erected, be it by private or public Act of Parliament, they are subject to the inspections of this Court by writ of error, or by certiorari and mandamus ." The Case of Cardiffe Bridge, 1 Salk. 146, 91 Eng. Rep. 135 (K. B.).  B This history teaches that it was only a matter of course that once the National Constitution had provided the opportunity for some recognition of state sovereign immunity, the necessity revealed through six centuries or more of history would show up in suits against state officers, just as <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> would later open the door to Ex parte Young itself.  Once, then, the Eleventh Amendment was understood to forbid suit *172 against a State eo nomine, the question arose "which suits against officers will be allowed and which will not be." Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 20.  "It early became clear that a suit against an officer was not forbidden simply because it raised a question as to the legality of his action as an agent of government or because it required him, as in mandamus, to perform an official duty.  These as we know had been well established before the eleventh amendment as not necessarily requiring consent.  To be sure the renewed emphasis on immunity given by the eleventh amendment might conceivably have been taken so to extend the doctrine as to exclude suits against state officers even in cases where the English tradition would have allowed them.  There was a running battle as to where the line would be drawn.
**Combined Opinion**
Id., at 20-21.  The earliest cases, United States v. Peters, 5 Cranch 115 (1809), and Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), embrace the English practice of permitting suits against officers, see Orth, Judicial Power of the United States, at 34-35, 40-41, 122, by focusing almost exclusively on whether the State had been named as a defendant.  Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 1 Pet. 110, 123-124 (1828), shifted this analysis somewhat, finding that a Governor could not be sued because he was sued "not by his name, but by his title," which was thought the functional equivalent of suing the State itself.  Madrazo did not, however, erase the *173 fundamental principle of Osborn that sovereign immunity would not bar a suit against a state officer.  See, e. g., Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203 (1873) (applying Osborn by enjoining the Governor of Texas to interfere with the possession of land granted by the State); United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196 (1882) (applying Osborn in context of federal sovereign immunity).  This simple rule for recognizing sovereign immunity without gutting substantial rights was temporarily muddled in Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U. S. 711 (1883), where the Court, although it "did not clearly say why," refused to hear a suit that would have required a state treasurer to levy taxes to pay interest on a bond. Currie, Sovereign Immunity and Suits Against Government Officers, 1984 S. Ct. Rev. 149, 152.  (One recalls the circumstances of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> itself, see supra, at 117-121.) The Court, however, again applied Osborn in the Virginia Coupon Cases, 114 U. S. 269 (1885) (permitting injunctions, restitution, and damages against state officers who seized property to collect taxes already paid with interest coupons the State had agreed to accept).  In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443, 502 (1887), sought to rationalize the competing strands of doctrine on the ground that an action may be "sustained only in those instances where the act complained of, considered apart from the official authority alleged as its justification, and as the personal act of the individual defendant, constituted a violation of right for which the plaintiff was entitled to a remedy at law or in equity against the wrongdoer in his individual character." Ex parte Young restored the old simplicity by complementing In re Ayers with the principle that state officers never have authority to violate the Constitution or federal law, so that any illegal action is stripped of state character and rendered an illegal individual act.  Suits against these officials are consequently barred by neither the Eleventh Amendment nor <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> immunity.  The officer's action "is simply an illegal act upon the part of a state official in attempting *174 by the use of the name of the State to enforce a legislative enactment which is void because unconstitutional.  .  .  .  The State has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States." Ex parte Young, 209 U. S., at 159-160 .
**Combined Opinion**
 Young would not function here to provide a merely supplementary regime of compensation to deter illegal action, but the sole jurisdictional basis for an Article III court's enforcement of a clear federal statutory obligation, without which a congressional act would be rendered a nullity in a federal court. One cannot intelligibly generalize from Chilicky `s standards for imposing the burden to justify a supplementary scheme of tort law to the displacement of Young `s traditional and indispensable jurisdictional basis for ensuring official compliance with federal law when a State itself is immune from suit.  2 Next, the Court suggests that it may be justified in displacing Young because Young would allow litigants to ignore the "intricate procedures" of IGRA in favor of a menu of streamlined equity rules from which any litigant could order as he saw fit.  But there is no basis in law for this suggestion, and the strongest authority to reject it.  Young did not establish a new cause of action and it does not impose any particular procedural regime in the suits it permits.  It stands, instead, for a jurisdictional rule by which paramount *178 federal law may be enforced in a federal court by substituting a nonimmune party (the state officer) for an immune one (the State itself).  Young does no more and furnishes no authority for the Court's assumption that it somehow pre-empts procedural rules devised by Congress for particular kinds of cases that may depend on Young for federal jurisdiction.  [61] If, indeed, the Court were correct in assuming that Congress may not regulate the procedure of a suit jurisdictionally dependent on Young , the consequences would be revolutionary, for example, in habeas law. It is well established that when a habeas corpus petitioner sues a state official alleging detention in violation of federal law and seeking the prospective remedy of release from custody, it is the doctrine identified in Ex parte Young that allows the petitioner to evade the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment (or, more properly, the <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> doctrine).  See Young, 209 U. S., at 167-168 ; Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U. S. 682, 689-690 (1949).  [62] And yet Congress has imposed *179 a number of restrictions upon the habeas remedy, see, e. g., 28 U. S. C. § 2254 (b) (requiring exhaustion of state remedies prior to bringing a federal habeas petition), and this Court has articulated several more, see, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991) (abuse of the writ); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989) (limiting applicability of "new rules" on habeas); Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993) (applying a more deferential harmless-error standard on habeas review).  By suggesting that Ex parte Young provides a free-standing remedy not subject to the restrictions otherwise imposed on federal remedial schemes (such as habeas corpus), the Court suggests that a state prisoner may circumvent these restrictions by ostensibly bringing his suit under Young rather than 28 U. S. C. § 2254 .  The Court's view implies similar consequences under any number of similarly structured federal statutory schemes.  [63] This, of course, cannot be the law, and the plausible rationale for rejecting the Court's contrary assumption is that Congress has just as much authority to regulate suits when jurisdiction depends on Young as it has to regulate when Young is out of the jurisdictional picture.  If Young does not preclude Congress from requiring state exhaustion in habeas cases (and it clearly does not), then Young does not bar the application of IGRA's procedures when effective relief is sought by suing a state officer.
**Combined Opinion**
 Our long-standing practice is to read ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional infirmity, Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988) ("`every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality' ") (quoting Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895)).  This practice alone (without any need for a clear statement to displace Young ) would be enough to require Young `s application.  So, too, would the application of another rule, requiring courts to choose any reasonable construction of a statute that would eliminate the need to confront a contested constitutional issue (in this case, the place of state sovereign immunity in federal-question cases and the status of Union Gas ).  NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 500-501 (1979).  Construing the statute to harmonize with Young , as it readily does, would have saved an Act of Congress and rendered a discussion on constitutional grounds wholly unnecessary.  This case should be decided on this basis alone.  V Absent the application of Ex parte Young, I would, of course, follow Union Gas in recognizing congressional power under Article I to abrogate <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> immunity.  Since the reasons for this position, as explained in Parts IIIII, supra, tend to unsettle <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> as well as support Union Gas, I should add a word about my reasons for continuing to accept <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> `s holding as a matter of stare decisis.  *183 The <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> doctrine was erroneous, but it has not previously proven to be unworkable or to conflict with later doctrine or to suffer from the effects of facts developed since its decision (apart from those indicating its original errors).  I would therefore treat <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> as it has always been treated in fact until today, as a doctrine of federal common law. For, as so understood, it has formed one of the strands of the federal relationship for over a century now, and the stability of that relationship is itself a value that stare decisis aims to respect.  In being ready to hold that the relationship may still be altered, not by the Court but by Congress, I would tread the course laid out elsewhere in our cases. The Court has repeatedly stated its assumption that insofar as the relative positions of States and Nation may be affected consistently with the Tenth Amendment, [65] they would not be modified without deliberately expressed intent.  See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 460-461 .  The plain-statement rule, which "assures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involved in the judicial decision," United States v. Bass, 404 U. S., at 349 , is particularly appropriate in light of our primary reliance on "[t]he effectiveness of the federal political process in preserving the States' interests," Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 552 (1985).  [66] Hence, we *184 have required such a plain statement when Congress preempts the historic powers of the States, Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947), imposes a condition on the grant of federal moneys, South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 207 (1987), or seeks to regulate a State's ability to determine the qualifications of its own officials, Gregory, supra, at 464 .  When judging legislation passed under unmistakable Article I powers, no further restriction could be required.  Nor does the Court explain why more could be demanded.
**Combined Opinion**
Ibid. [9]  Under the "plain text" of the Eleventh Amendment, I note that there would appear to be no more basis for the conclusion that States may consent to federal-court jurisdiction in actions brought by out-of-state or foreign citizens than there would be for the view that States should be permitted to consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in a case that poses no federal question.  See, e. g., Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U. S. 365, 377, n. 21 (1978); Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 398 (1975); California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109, 112-113, n. 3 (1972); American Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 U. S. 6, 17-18 , and n. 17 (1951); Mitchell v. Maurer, 293 U. S. 237, 244 (1934); Jackson v. Ashton, 8 Pet. 148, 149 (1834).  We have, however, construed the Amendment, despite its text, to apply only to unconsenting States.  See, e. g., Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436, 447 (1883).  In so doing, we of course left it for Congress to determine whether federal courts should entertain any claim against a State in federal court. A departure from the text to expand the class of plaintiffs to whom the Eleventh Amendment's bar applies would, however, limit Congress' authority to exercise its considered judgment as to the propriety of federal-court jurisdiction.  The absence of a textual warrant for imposing such a broad limitation on the legislative branch counsels against this Court extratextually imposing one.  [10]  In his dissent in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 36-37 , Justice Scalia contended that the existence of the Judiciary Act of 1875 at the time of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> requires one to accept the "gossamer distinction between cases in which Congress has assertedly sought to eliminate state sovereign immunity pursuant to its powers to create and organize courts, and cases in which it has assertedly sought to do so pursuant to some of its other powers," in order to conclude that, in spite of <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , Congress may authorize federal courts to hear a suit against an unconsenting State.  I rely on no such "gossamer distinction" here.  Congress has the authority to withdraw sovereign immunity in cases not covered by the Eleventh Amendment under all of its various powers.  Nothing in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> is to the contrary.  As the passage quoted above demonstrates, <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> merely concluded that Congress, in enacting the Judiciary Act of 1875, did not manifest a desire to withdraw state sovereign immunity with sufficient clarity to overcome the countervailing presumption.  Therefore, I rely only on the distinction between a statute that clearly directs federal courts to entertain suits against States, such as the one before us here, and a statute that does not, such as the Judiciary Act of 1875.  In light of our repeated application of a clear-statement rule in Eleventh Amendment cases, from <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> onward, I would be surprised to learn that such a distinction is too thin to be acceptable.  [11]  Indeed, to the extent the reasoning of Monaco was premised on the ground that a contrary ruling might permit foreign governments and States indirectly to frustrate Congress' treaty power, 292 U. S., at 331 , the opinion suggests that its outcome would have been quite different had Congress expressly authorized suits by foreign governments against individual States as part of its administration of foreign policy.  [12]  Moreover, they would have most unnecessarily burdened Congress.  For example, after deciding that Congress had not made sufficiently explicit its intention to withdraw the state sovereign immunity defense in certain bankruptcy actions, see Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 392 U. S. 96 (1989), Congress understandably concluded that it could correct the confusion by amending the relevant statute to make its intentions to override such a defense unmistakably clear.  See In re Merchants Grain, Inc., 59 F. 3d 630 (CA7 1995).  Congress will no doubt be surprised to learn that its exercise in legislative clarification, which it undertook for our benefit, was for naught because the Constitution makes it so. [13]  Significantly, Chief Justice Marshall understood the Eleventh Amendment's bar to have been designed primarily to protect States from being sued for their debts.  See Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 406 (1821).  [14]  Significantly, many of the cases decided after <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> in which this Court has recognized state sovereign immunity involved claims premised on the breach of rights that were rooted in state law. See Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459 (1945); Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47 (1944); Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436 (1900).  In such cases, the Court's application of the state-law immunity appears simply to foreshadow (or follow) the rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), not to demark the limits of Article III. [15]  It is significant that Justice Souter's opinion makes it perfectly clear that Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and he did not consider it necessary to rely on the holding in Union Gas to support their conclusion.  I find today's decision particularly unfortunate because of its failure to advance an acceptable reason for refusing to adhere to a precedent upon which the Congress, as well as the courts, should be entitled to rely.  [16]  See Stevens, Is Justice Irrelevant?, 87 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1121 , 11241125 (1993).  [17]  Interestingly, this passage demonstrates that the Court's application of a common-law sovereign immunity defense in Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934), was quite probably justified.  There a foreign state sued a State as a substantial creditor, and thus implicated the very purpose of the Eleventh Amendment.  [18]  Because Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890), was the first case in which the Court held that a State could not be sued in federal court by one of its citizens, this comment is of interest: "It is not necessary that we should enter upon an examination of the reason or the expediency of the rule which exempts a sovereign State from prosecution in a court of justice at the suit of individuals.  This is fully discussed by writers on public law. It is enough for us to declare its existence." <citedDecision>Id., at 21</citedDecision> .  So it is today.  [1]  The two Citizen-State Diversity Clauses provide as follows: "The judicial Power shall extend .  .  .  to Controversies .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 [6]  See also 2 Dall., at 435 ("[I]t is certain that in regard to any common law principle which can influence the question before us no alteration has been made by any statute"); id., at 437 (if "no new remedy be provided.  .  .  we have no other rule to govern us but the principles of the preexistent laws, which must remain in force till superseded by others"); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 283 (1985) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  But see Justice Iredell's dicta suggesting that the Constitution would not permit suits against a State.  Chisholm, supra, at 449 (dissenting opinion); Atascadero, supra, at 283, n. 34 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  [7]  Of course, even if Justice Iredell had concluded that state sovereign immunity was not subject to abrogation, it would be inappropriate to assume (as it appears the Court does today, and Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890), did as well) that the Eleventh Amendment (regardless of what it says) "constitutionalized" Justice Iredell's dissent, or that it simply adopted the opposite of the holding in Chisholm .  It is as odd to read the Eleventh Amendment's rejection of Chisholm (which held that States may be sued in diversity) to say that States may not be sued on a federal question as it would be to read the Twenty-Sixth Amendment's rejection of Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112 (1970) (which held that Congress could not require States to extend the suffrage to 18-year-olds) to permit Congress to require States to extend the suffrage to 12-year-olds.  [8]  The great weight of scholarly commentary agrees.  See, e. g., Jackson, The Supreme Court, the Eleventh Amendment, and State Sovereign Immunity, 98 Yale L. J. 1 (1988); Amar, Of Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L. J. 1425 (1987); Fletcher, A Historical Interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment: A Narrow Construction of an Affirmative Grant of Jurisdiction Rather than a Prohibition Against Jurisdiction, 35 Stan.  L. Rev. 1033 (1983); Gibbons, The Eleventh Amendment and State Sovereign Immunity: A Reinterpretation, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1889 (1983); Field, The Eleventh Amendment and Other Sovereign Immunity Doctrines: Congressional Imposition of Suit Upon the States, 126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1203 (1978).  While a minority has adopted the second view set out above, see, e. g., Marshall, Fighting the Words of the Eleventh Amendment, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1342 (1989); Massey, State Sovereignty and the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 61 (1989), and others have criticized the diversity theory, see, e. g., Marshall, The Diversity Theory of the Eleventh Amendment: A Critical Evaluation, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1372 (1989), I have discovered no commentator affirmatively advocating the position taken by the Court today.  As one scholar has observed, the literature is "remarkably consistent in its evaluation of the historical evidence and text of the amendment as not supporting a broad rule of constitutional immunity for states."
**Combined Opinion**
 An argument rooted in the text of a constitutional provision may not be guaranteed of carrying the day, but insubstantiality is not its failing.  See, e. g., Monaghan, Our Perfect Constitution, 56 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 353, 383-384 (1981) ("For the purposes of legal reasoning, the binding quality of the constitutional text is itself incapable of and not in need of further demonstration"); cf. Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U. S. 171, 178 (1987) (Rehnquist, C. J.) ("It would be extraordinary to require legislative history to confirm the plain meaning of [Federal Rule of Evidence] 104"); Garcia v. United States, 469 U. S. 70, 75 (1984) (Rehnquist, J.) ("[O]nly the most extraordinary showing of contrary intentions from [the legislative history] would justify a limitation on the `plain meaning' of the statutory language").  This is particularly true in construing the jurisdictional provisions of Article III, which speak with a clarity not to be found in some of the more opentextured provisions of the Constitution.  See National Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., 337 U. S. 582, 646-647 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); Schauer, Easy Cases, 58 S. Cal. L. Rev. 399 , 424 (1985) (noting the "seemingly plain linguistic mandate" of the Eleventh Amendment).  That the Court thinks otherwise is an indication of just how far it has strayed beyond the boundaries of traditional constitutional analysis.  [14]  Professor Jackson has noted the "remarkabl[e] consisten[cy]" of the scholarship on this point, Jackson, 98 Yale L. J.,at 44, n. 179.  See also n. 8, supra. [15]  Indeed, as Justice Stevens suggests, there is language in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> suggesting that the Court was really construing the Judiciary Act of 1875 rather than the Constitution.  See ante, at 84-87.  [16]  See Gibbons, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 2000 ("Without weakening the contract clause, which over the next two decades the Fuller Court might need both in its fight against government regulation of business and as a weapon against defaulting local governments, the justices needed a way to let the South win the repudiation war.  The means Bradley chose was to rewrite the eleventh amendment and the history of its adoption").  The commentators' contention that this Court's inability to enforce the obligation of Southern States to pay their debts influenced the result in Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890), is substantiated by three anomalies of this Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence during that period.  First, this Court held in 1885 that Virginia's sovereign immunity did not allow it to abrogate its bonds.  Virginia Coupon Cases, 114 U. S. 269 .  The difference from the situation inother States, however, was that Virginia had made its bond coupons receivable in payment of state taxes; "[u]nder these circumstances federal courts did not need to rely on the political branches of government to enforce their orders but could protect creditors by a judgment that their taxes had in fact been paid.  In these cases the Eleventh Amendment faded into the background." J. Orth, Judicial Power of the United States: The Eleventh Amendment in American History 9 (1987); see generally id., at 90-109.  Second, at the same time that this Court was articulating broad principles of immunity for States, we refused to recognize similar immunity for municipalities and similar state political subdivisions.
**Combined Opinion**
Orth, supra, at 128.  See also Gibbons, supra, at 2002 (arguing that the Court's unanimous revival of its power to grant equitable relief against state officers in Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U. S. 1 (1891), was made possible by the fact that the case "did not involve Southern State bonds").  I am reluctant, to be sure, to ascribe these legal developments to a single, extralegal cause, and at least one commentator has suggested that the Southern debt crisis may not have been the only factor driving the Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence during this period.  See generally Collins, The Conspiracy Theory of the Eleventh Amendment, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 212 (1988) (reviewing Orth).  But neither would I ignore the pattern of the cases, which tends to show that the presence or absence of enforcement difficulties significantly influenced the path of the law in this area.  See id., at 243 (acknowledging that "[i]t is perfectly conceivable that Compromise-related politics exerted their influence at the margin in doubtful cases in which the Court might have gone either way").  [17]  Today's majority condemns my attention to <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> `s historical circumstances as "a disservice to the Court's traditional method of adjudication." Ante, at 69.  The point, however, is not that historical circumstance may undermine an otherwise defensible decision; on the contrary, it is just because <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> is so utterly indefensible on the merits of its legal analysis that one is forced to look elsewhere in order to understand how the Court could have gone so far wrong.  Nor is there anything new or remarkable in taking such a look, for we have sought similar explanations in other cases. In Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U. S. 219 (1987), for example, we suggested that the Court's holding in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861), that "the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it," id., at 107 , was influenced by "the looming shadow of a Civil War," Branstad, supra, at 227 , and we ultimately determined that Dennison should be overruled, 483 U. S., at 230.  The author of the Court's opinion today joined that analysis, as did the other Members of today's majority who were then on the Court. See ibid. (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (joining the relevant portion of the majority opinion); id., at 231 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (same).  [18]  See also Georgia Railroad & Banking Co. v. Redwine, 342 U. S. 299, 304 (1952) (same); Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U. S. 516, 524 (1899) (same).  Even Justice Scalia's dissent in Union Gas, the reasoning of which the majority adopts today, acknowledged that its view of sovereign immunity depended upon "some other constitutional principle beyond the immediate text of the Eleventh Amendment." 491 U. S., at 31 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  To the extent that our prior cases do refer to <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> immunity as part of the Eleventh Amendment, they can only be referring to Justice Stevens's "other" Eleventh Amendment.  Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U. S. 30, 53 (1994) (Stevens, J., concurring); see also Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., supra, at 23-29 (Stevens, J., concurring) (same).  [19]  See also Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 31-32 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("What we said in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> was, essentially, that the Eleventh Amendment was important not merely for what it said but for what it reflected: a consensus that the doctrine of sovereign immunity, for States as well as for the Federal Government, was part of the understood background against which the Constitution was adopted, and which its jurisdictional provisions did not mean to sweep away"); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 440 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (interpreting Monaco as "rel[ying] on precepts underlying but not explicit in Art. III and the Eleventh Amendment").  [20]  There are good reasons not to take many of these statements too seriously.  Some are plainly exaggerated; for example, the suggestion in Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), that "[a] state's freedom from litigation was established as a constitutional right through the Eleventh Amendment" obviously ignores a State's liability to suit by other States, see, e. g., South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286 (1904), and by the National Government, see, e. g., United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892).  See also Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 420, n. 19 (noting that "the Eleventh Amendment has not accorded the States absolute sovereign immunity in federal-court actions").  Similarly, statements such as in Ex parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497 , that "the entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given" should not necessarily be taken as affirming that Article III itself incorporated a constitutional immunity doctrine.  How else to explain Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , which stated, practically in the same breath, that "a suit directly against a State by one of its own citizens is not one to which the judicial power of the United States extends," and that Chisholm "was based upon a sound interpretation of the Constitution as that instrument then was"?  134 U. S., at 21.  [21]  See also Georgia Railroad & Banking Co. v. Redwine, supra, at 304 ; Fitts v. McGhee, supra, at 524-525 .  [22]  See also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 501 (1975) ("Congress may grant an express right of action to persons who otherwise would be barred by prudential standing rules"); E. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction § 2.1, pp. 42-43 (2d ed. 1994).  [23]  Indeed, The Chief Justice could hardly have been clearer in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), where he explained that "[t]he Court's decision in Hans v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1890), offers impressive authority for the principle that the States as such were regarded by the Framers of the Constitution as partaking of many attributes of sovereignty quite apart from the provisions of the Tenth Amendment.  .  .  .  "As it was not the Eleventh Amendment by its terms which justified the result in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> , it is not the Tenth Amendment by its terms that prohibits congressional action which sets a mandatory ceiling on the wages of all state employees.  Both Amendments are simply examples of the understanding of those who drafted and ratified the Constitution that the States were sovereign in many respects, and that although their legislative authority could be superseded by Congress in many areas where Congress was competent to act, Congress was nonetheless not free to deal with a State as if it were just another individual or business enterprise subject to regulation." Id., at 556-557 (dissenting opinion).  [24]  Indeed, in Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 439, The Chief Justice complained in dissent that the same statements upon which he relies today had been "dismiss[ed] .  .  .  as dicta." [25]  In Hoffman, one Member of the four-Justice plurality expressly disavowed the plurality's assumption that Congress could abrogate the States' immunity by making its intent to do so clear.  See 492 U. S., at 105 (O'Connor, J.,concurring).  The four dissenters, however, not only assumed that Congress had the power to abrogate but found that it had done so. See id., at 106 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Likewise, in Welch , the four-Justice plurality was joined by four dissenters who insisted upon a congressional power of abrogation.  See 483 U. S., at 519 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  [26]  The Court seeks to disparage the common-law roots of the doctrine, and the consequences of those roots which I outline infra, at 132-142 and 159-164, by asserting that <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> "found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental ` "jurisprudence in all civilized nations. "` " Ante, at 69 (quoting Hans, <citedDecision>134 U. S., at 17</citedDecision> ).  The <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> Court, however, relied explicitly on the ground that a suit against the State by its own citizen was "not known .  .  .  at the common law" and was not among the departures from the common law recognized by the Constitution.  <citedDecision>Id., at 15</citedDecision> .  Moreover, <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> explicitly adopted the reasoning of Justice Iredell's dissent in Chisholm , see 134 U. S., at 18-19, and that opinion could hardly have been clearer in relying exclusively on the common law. "The only principles of law .  .  .  which can affect this case," Justice Iredell wrote, "[are] those that are derived from what is properly termed `the common law,' a law which I presume is the ground-work of the laws in every State in the Union, and which I consider, so far as it is applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the country, and where no special act of Legislation controuls it, to be in force in each State, as it existed in England, (unaltered by any statute) at the time of the first settlement of the country." 2 Dall., at 435 (emphasis deleted).  See also Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 288 (1973) (Marshall, J., concurring in result) ("Sovereign immunity is a common-law doctrine that long predates our Constitution and the Eleventh Amendment, although it has, of course, been carried forward in our jurisprudence"); R. Watkins, The State as a Party Litigant 51-52 (1927) ("It thus seems probable that the doctrine of state immunity was accepted rather as an existing fact by the people of the states, than adopted as a theory.  It was a matter of universal practice, and was accepted from the mother country along with the rest of the common law of England applicable to our changed state and condition").

For he is free that can be free when he will: nor is it possible for any person to be bound to himself, because he that can bind can release; and therefore he that is bound to himself only is not bound"); Bodin, supra, at 28-29 ("One may be subject to laws made by another, but it is impossible to bind oneself in any matter which is the subject of one's own free exercise of will. .  .. It follows of necessity that the king cannot be subject to his own laws").  [50]  See also Wood 466 ("[O]nce men grasped, as they increasingly did in the middle [1780's], that reform of the national government was the best means of remedying the evils caused by the state governments, then the revision of the Articles of Confederation assumed an impetus and an importance that it had not had a few years earlier").  [51]  Cf. Jay I, at 1033-1034 ("English common law might afford clues to the meaning of some terms in the Constitution, but the absence of any close federal model was recognized even at the Convention"); F. Coker, Commentary, in R. Pound, C. McIlwain, & R. Nichols, Federalism as a Democratic Process 81-82 (1942).  [52]  See, e. g., Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537, 543 (1903) (acknowledging the immunity recognized in <citedDecision>Hans</citedDecision> and other cases, but observing that "[i]t would, indeed, be most unfortunate if the immunity of the individual States from suits by citizens of other States, provided for in the Eleventh Amendment, were to be interpreted as nullifying those other provisions which confer power on Congress .  .  .  all of which provisions existed before the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, which still exist, and which would be nullified and made of no effect, if the judicial power of the United States could not be invoked to protect citizens affected by the passage of state laws disregarding these constitutional limitations").  The majority contends that state compliance with federal law may be enforced by other means, ante, at 71, n. 14, but its suggestions are all pretty cold comfort: the enforcement resources of the Federal Government itself are limited; appellate review of state court decisions is contingent upon state consent to suit in state court, and is also called into question by the majority's rationale, see supra, at 114; and the Court's decision today illustrates the uncertainty that the Court will always permit enforcement of federal law by suits for prospective relief against state officers.  Moreover, the majority's position ignores the importance of citizen suits to enforcement of federal law. See, e. g., Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 263 (1975) (acknowledging that, in many instances, "Congress has opted to rely heavily on private enforcement to implement public policy"); see also S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 2 (Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U. S. C. § 1988 ) (recognizing that "[a]ll of these civil rights laws depend heavily upon private enforcement"); Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711, 737 (1987) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (noting importance of citizens' suits under federal environmental laws).  [53]  The Court's further assertion, that "Congress itself waited nearly a century before even conferring federal-question jurisdiction on the lower federal courts," ante, at 71, is simply incorrect.
