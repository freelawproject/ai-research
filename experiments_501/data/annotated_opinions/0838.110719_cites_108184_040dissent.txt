 See also Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., 436 U. S. 307, 323 (1978); United States v. United States District Court, supra, at 321.  The safeguards embodied in the warrant requirement apply as forcefully to automobile searches as to any others.  Our cases do recognize a narrow exception to the warrant requirement for certain automobile searches.  Throughout our decisions, two major considerations have been advanced to justify the automobile exception to the warrant require *830 ment.  We have upheld only those searches that are actually justified by those considerations.  First, these searches have been justified on the basis of the exigency of the mobility of the automobile.  See, e. g., Chambers v. Maroney, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 42</citedDecision> (1970); Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925).  This “mobility” rationale is something of a misnomer, cf. Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U. S. 433, 442-443 (1973), since the police ordinarily can remove the car’s occupants and secure the vehicle on the spot. However, the inherent mobility of the vehicle often creates situations in which the police’s only alternative to an immediate search may be to release the automobile from their possession.  2 This alternative creates an unacceptably high risk of losing the contents of the vehicle, and is a principal basis for the Court’s automobile exception to the warrant requirement.  See <citedDecision>Chambers, supra, at 51, n. 9</citedDecision> .  In many cases, however, the police will, prior to searching the car, have cause to arrest the occupants and bring them to the station for booking.  In this situation, the police can ordinarily seize the automobile and bring it to the station.  Because the vehicle is now in the exclusive control of the authorities, any subsequent search cannot be justified by the mobility of the car. Rather, an immediate warrantless search of the vehicle is permitted because of the second major justification for the automobile exception: the diminished expectation of privacy in an automobile.  Because an automobile presents much of its contents in open view to police officers who legitimately stop it on a public way, is used for travel, and is subject to significant gov *831 ernment regulation, this Court has determined that the intrusion of a warrantless search of an automobile is constitutionally less significant than a warrantless search of more private areas.  See Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753, 761 (1979) (collecting cases).  This justification has been invoked for warrantless automobile searches in circumstances where the exigency of mobility was clearly not present.  See, e. g., South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364, 367-368 (1976); Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, at 441-442 .  By focusing on the defendant’s reasonable expectation of privacy, this Court has refused to require a warrant in situations where the process of obtaining such a warrant would be more intrusive than the actual search itself.  Cf. Katz v. United States, supra. A defendant may consider the seizure of the car a greater intrusion than an immediate search.  See <citedDecision>Chambers, supra, at 51-52</citedDecision> .  Therefore, even where police can bring both the defendant and the automobile to the station safely and can house the car while they seek a warrant, the police are permitted to decide whether instead to conduct an immediate search of the car. In effect, the warrantless search is permissible because a warrant requirement would not provide significant protection of the defendant’s Fourth Amendment interests.  B The majority’s rule is flatly inconsistent with these established Fourth Amendment principles concerning the scope of the automobile exception and the importance of the warrant requirement.  Historically, the automobile exception has been limited to those situations where its application is compelled by the justifications described above.  Today, the majority makes no attempt to base its decision on these justifications.  This failure is not surprising, since the traditional rationales for the automobile exception plainly do not support extending it to the search of a container found inside a vehicle.  *832 The practical mobility problem — deciding what to do with both the car and the occupants if an immediate search is not conducted — is simply not present in the case of movable containers, which can easily be seized and brought to the magistrate.

 5 II In announcing its new rule, the Court purports to rely on earlier automobile search cases, especially Carroll v. United States.  The Court’s approach, however, far from being “faithful to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that the Court has followed with substantial consistency throughout our history,” ante, at 824, is plainly contrary to the letter and the spirit of our prior automobile search cases. Moreover, the new rule produces anomalous and unacceptable consequences.  *836 A The majority’s argument that its decision is supported by our decisions in Carroll and Chambers is misplaced.  The Court in Carroll upheld a warrantless search of an automobile for contraband on the basis of the impracticability of securing a warrant in cases involving the transportation of contraband goods.  The Court did not, however, suggest that obtaining a warrant for the search of an automobile is always impracticable.  6 “In cases where the securing of a warrant is reasonably practicable, it must be used .... In cases where seizure is impossible except without warrant, the seizing officer acts unlawfully and at his peril unless he can show the court probable cause.” 267 U. S., at 156 (emphasis added).  7 As this Court reaffirmed in Chambers, <citedDecision>399 U. S., *837at 50</citedDecision> , “[n]either Carroll, supra, nor other cases in this Court require or suggest that in every conceivable circumstance the search of an auto even with probable cause may be made without the extra protection for privacy that a warrant affords.” Notwithstanding the reasoning of these cases, the majority argues that Carroll and Chambers support its decisions because integral compartments of a car are functionally equivalent to containers found within a car, and because the practical advantages to the police of the Carroll doctrine “would be largely nullified if the permissible scope of a warrantless search of an automobile did not include containers and packages found inside the vehicle.” Ante, at 820.  Neither of these arguments is persuasive.  First, the Court’s argument that allowing warrantless searches of certain integral compartments of the car in Carroll and Chambers, while protecting movable containers within the car, would be “illogical” and “absurd,” ante, at 818, ignores the reason why this Court has allowed warrantless searches of automobile compartments.  Surely an integral compartment within a car is just as mobile, and presents the same practical problems of safekeeping, as the car itself.  This cannot be said of movable containers located within the car. The fact that there may be a high expectation of privacy in both containers and compartments is irrelevant, since the privacy rationale is not, and cannot be, the justification for the warrantless search of compartments.  The Court’s second argument, which focuses on the practical advantages to police of the Carroll doctrine, fares no better.  The practical considerations which concerned the Carroll Court involved the difficulty of immobilizing a vehicle while a warrant must be obtained.

 Although in other early cases containers may in fact have been searched, see ante, at 818-819, the parties did not litigate in this Court the question whether containers deserve separate protection.  The Court’s suggestion that the absence of such an argument “illuminates the profession’s understanding of the scope of the search permitted under Carroll," ante, at 819, is an unusual approach to constitutional interpretation.  I would hesitate to rely upon the “profession’s understanding” of the Fourteenth Amendment or of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), in the early part of this century as justification for not granting Negroes constitutional protection.  See Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954).  Moreover, for a number of reasons, including the broad scope of the permitted search incident to arrest prior to Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), and the uncertain meaning of a “search” prior to Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967), the profession formerly advanced different arguments against automobile searches than it advances today.  Seizures of automobiles can be distinguished because of the greater interest of defendants in continuing possession of their means of transportation; in the case of automobiles, a seizure is more likely to be a greater intrusion than an immediate search.  See Chambers v. Maroney, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 42, 51-52</citedDecision> (1970).  Both cases would appear to fall within the majority’s new rule.  In United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977), federal agents had probable cause to search a footlocker.  Although the footlocker had been placed in the trunk of a car and the occupants were about to depart, the Court refused to rely on the automobile exception to uphold the search.  (It is true that the United States did not argue in this Court that the search was justified pursuant to that exception, but the theory was hardly so novel that this Court could not have responsibly relied upon it.) In Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753 (1979), too, the suitcase was mobile and police had probable cause to search it; it was carried in an automobile for several blocks before the automobile was stopped and the suitcase was seized and searched.  Again, however, this Court invalidated the search.
