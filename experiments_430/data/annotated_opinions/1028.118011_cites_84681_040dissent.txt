Justice Stevens, dissenting.  This case is about power — the power of the Congress of the United States to create a private federal cause of action against a State, or its Governor, for the violation of a federal right.  In Chisholm v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall. 419</citedDecision> (1793), the entire Court — including Justice Iredell whose dissent provided the blueprint for the Eleventh Amendment — assumed that Congress had such power.  In Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890) — a case the Court purports to follow today — the Court *77 again assumed that Congress had such power.  In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), and v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 24 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring), the Court squarely held that Congress has such power.  In a series of cases beginning with Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 478 U. S. 234 , 238-289 (1985), the Court formulated a special “clear statement rule” to determine whether specific Acts of Congress contained an effective exercise of that power.  Nevertheless, in a sharp break with the past, today the Court holds that with the narrow and illogical exception of statutes enacted pursuant to the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress has no such power.  The importance of the majority’s decision to overrule the Court’s holding in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. cannot be overstated.  The majority’s opinion does not simply preclude Congress from establishing the rather curious statutory scheme under which Indian tribes may seek the aid of a federal court to secure a State’s good-faith negotiations over gaming regulations.  Rather, it prevents Congress from providing a federal forum for a broad range of actions against States, from those sounding in copyright and patent law, to those concerning bankruptcy, environmental law, and the regulation of our vast national economy.  1 *78 There may be room for debate over whether, in light of the Eleventh Amendment, Congress has the power to ensure that such a cause of action may be enforced in federal court by a citizen of another State or a foreign citizen.  There can be no serious debate, however, over whether Congress has the power to ensure that such a cause of action may be brought by a citizen of the State being sued.  Congress’ authority in that regard is clear.  As Justice Souter has convincingly demonstrated, the Court’s contrary conclusion is profoundly misguided.  Despite the thoroughness of his analysis, supported by sound reason, history, precedent, and strikingly uniform scholarly commentary, the shocking character of the majority’s affront to a coequal branch of our Government merits additional comment.  I For the purpose of deciding this case, I can readily assume that Justice Iredell’s dissent in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, 2 Dall., at 429-450</citedDecision> , and the Court’s opinion in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), correctly stated the law that should govern our decision today.  As I shall explain, both of those opinions relied on an interpretation of an Act of Congress rather than a want of congressional power to authorize a suit against the State.  In concluding that the federal courts could not entertain Chisholm’s action against the State of Georgia, Justice Ire-dell relied on the text of the Judiciary Act of 1789, not the State’s assertion that Article III did not extend the judicial power to suits against unconsenting States.  Justice Iredell argued that, under Article III, federal courts possessed only *79 such jurisdiction as Congress had provided, and that the Judiciary Act expressly limited federal-court jurisdiction to that which could be exercised in accordance with “ 'the principles and usages of law.’ ” <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall., at 434</citedDecision> (quoting § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789).  He reasoned that the inclusion of this phrase constituted a command to the federal courts to construe their jurisdiction in light of the prevailing common law, a background legal regime that he believed incorporated the doctrine of sovereign immunity.  <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall., at 434-436</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  2 Because Justice Iredell believed that the expansive text of Article III did not prevent Congress from imposing this common-law limitation on federal-court jurisdiction, he concluded that judges had no authority to entertain a suit against an unconsenting State.  3 At the same time, although he acknowledged that the Constitution might allow Congress to extend federal-court jurisdiction to such an action, he concluded that the terms of the Judiciary Act of 1789 plainly had not done so. “[Congress’] direction, I apprehend, we cannot supersede, because it may appear to us not sufficiently extensive.  If it be not, we must wait till other remedies are provided by the same authority.  From this it is plain that the Legislature did not chuse to leave to our own *80 discretion the path to justice, but has prescribed one of its own.  In doing so, it has, I think, wisely, referred us to principles and usages of law already well known, and by their precision calculated to guard against that innovating spirit of Courts of Justice, which the Attorney-General in another case reprobated with so much warmth, and with whose sentiments in that particular, I most cordially join.” <citedDecision>Id., at 434</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  For Justice Iredell then, it was enough to assume that Article III permitted Congress to impose sovereign immunity as a jurisdictional limitation; he did not proceed to resolve the further question whether the Constitution went so far as to prevent Congress from withdrawing a State’s immunity.  4 Thus, it would be ironic to construe the <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> dissent as precedent for the conclusion that Article III limits Congress’ power to determine the scope of a State’s sovereign immunity in federal court. The precise holding in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> is difficult to state ber cause each of the Justices in the majority wrote his own opinion.  They seem to have held, however, not that the Judiciary Act of 1789 precluded the defense of sovereign immunity, but that Article III of the Constitution itself required the Supreme Court to entertain original actions *81 against unconsenting States.  5 I agree with Justice Iredell that such a construction of Article III is incorrect; that Article should not then have been construed, and should not now be construed, to prevent Congress from granting States a sovereign immunity defense in such cases. 6 That reading of Article III, however, explains why the majority’s holding in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> could not have been reversed by a simple statutory amendment adopting Justice Iredell’s interpretation of the Judiciary Act of 1789.  There is a special irony in the fact that the error committed by the <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> majority was its decision that this Court, rather than Congress, should define the scope of the sovereign immunity defense.  That, of course, is precisely the same error the Court commits today.  In light of the nature of the disagreement between Justice Iredell and his colleagues, Chisholm’s holding could have been overturned by simply amending the Constitution to restore to Congress the authority to recognize the doctrine.  As it was, the plain text of the Eleventh Amendment would seem to go further and to limit the judicial power itself in a certain class of cases. In doing so, however, the Amend *82 ment’s quite explicit text establishes only a partial bar to a federal court’s power to entertain a suit against a State.  7 Justice Brennan has persuasively explained that the Eleventh Amendment’s jurisdictional restriction is best understood to apply only to suits premised on diversity jurisdiction, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 247 (dissenting opinion), and Justice Scalia has agreed that the plain text of the Amendment cannot be read to apply to federal-question cases. See Pennsylvania v. Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 31 (dissenting opinion).  8 Whatever the precise dimensions of the Amendment, its express terms plainly do not apply to all suits brought against unconsenting States.  9 *83 The question thus becomes whether the relatively modest jurisdictional bar that the Eleventh Amendment imposes should be understood to reveal that a more general jurisdictional bar implicitly inheres in Article III. The language of Article III certainly gives no indication that such an implicit bar exists.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The majority relies first on our decision in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), which involved a suit by a citizen of Louisiana against that State for a claimed violation of the Contracts Clause.  The majority suggests that by dismissing the suit, Hans effectively held that federal courts have no power to hear federal-question suits brought by same-state plaintiffs.  Hans does not hold, however, that the Eleventh Amendment, or any other constitutional provision, precludes federal courts from entertaining actions brought by citizens against their own States in the face of contrary congressional direction.  As I have explained before, see Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 25-26 (Stevens, J., concurring), and as Justice Souter effectively demonstrates, Hans instead reflects, at the most, this Court’s conclusion that, as a matter of federal common law, federal courts should decline to entertain suits against unconsenting States.  Because Hans did not announce a constitutionally mandated jurisdictional bar, one need not overrule Hans , or even question its reasoning, in order to conclude that Congress may direct the federal courts to reject sovereign immunity in those suits not mentioned by the Eleventh Amendment.  Instead, one need only follow it.  Justice Bradley’s somewhat cryptic opinion for the Court in Hans relied expressly on the reasoning of Justice Iredell’s dissent in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , which, of course, was premised on the view that the doctrine of state sovereign immunity was a common-law rule that Congress had directed federal courts to respect, not a constitutional immunity that Congress was powerless to displace.  For that reason, Justice Bradley explained that the State’s immunity from suit by one of its own *85 citizens was based not on a constitutional rule but rather on the fact that Congress had not, by legislation, attempted to overcome the common-law presumption of sovereign immunity.  His analysis so clearly supports the position rejected by the majority today that it is worth quoting at length.  “But besides the presumption that no anomalous and unheard of proceedings or suits were intended to be raised up by the Constitution — anomalous and unheard of when the Constitution was adopted — an additional reason why the jurisdiction claimed for the Circuit Court does not exist, is the language of the act of Congress by which its jurisdiction is conferred.  The words are these: ‘The circuit courts of the United States shall have original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several States, of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity,... arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties,’ etc. — ‘Concurrent with the courts of the several States.’ Does not this qualification show that Congress, in legislating to carry the Constitution into effect, did not intend to invest its.  courts with any new and strange jurisdictions?  The state courts- have no power to entertain suits by individuáis- against a State without its consent.. Then how does the Circuit- Court, having, only concurrent jurisdiction, acquire any such power?' It is true that the same qualification existed in the judiciary act of 1789, which was before the court in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia</citedDecision> , and the majority of the court did not think that it was sufficient to limit the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. Justice Iredell thought differently.  In view of the manner in which that decision was received by the country, the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, the light of history and the reason of the thing, we think we are at liberty to prefer Justice Iredell’s views in this regard.” Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S., at 18-19 .  *86 As this passage demonstrates, Hans itself looked to see whether Congress had displaced the presumption that sovereign immunity obtains.  Although the opinion did go to great lengths to establish the quite uncontroversial historical proposition that unconsenting States generally were not subject to suit, that entire discussion preceded the opinion’s statutory analysis.  See id., at 10-18 .  Thus, the opinion’s thorough historical investigation served only to establish a presumption against jurisdiction that Congress must overcome, not an inviolable jurisdictional restriction that inheres in the Constitution itself.  Indeed, the very fact that the Court characterized the doctrine of sovereign immunity as a “presumption” confirms its assumption that it could be displaced.

 Except insofar as it has been incorporated into the text of the Eleventh Amendment, the doctrine is entirely the product of judge-made law. Three features of its English ancestry make it particularly unsuitable for incorporation into the law of this democratic Nation.  First, the assumption that it could be supported by a belief that “the King can do no wrong” has always been absurd; the bloody path trod by English monarchs both before and after they reached the throne demonstrated the fictional character of any such assumption.  Even if the fiction had been acceptable in Britain, the recitation in the Declaration of Independence of the wrongs committed by George III made that proposition unacceptable on this side of the Atlantic.  *96 Second, centuries ago the belief that the monarch served by divine right made it appropriate to assume that redress for wrongs committed by the sovereign should be the exclusive province of still higher authority.  16 While such a justification for a rule that immunized the sovereign from suit in a secular tribunal might have been acceptable in a jurisdiction where a particular faith is endorsed by the government, it should give rise to skepticism concerning the legitimacy of comparable rules in a society where a constitutional wall separates the State from the Church.  Third, in a society where noble birth can justify preferential treatment, it might have been unseemly to allow a commoner to hale the monarch into court. Justice Wilson explained how foreign such a justification is to this Nation’s principles.  See <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall., at 455</citedDecision> .  Moreover, Chief Justice Marshall early on laid to rest the view that the purpose of the Eleventh Amendment was to protect a State’s dignity.  Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 406-407 (1821).  Its purpose, he explained, was far more practical.  “That its motive was not to maintain the sovereignty of a State from the degradation supposed to attend a compulsory appearance before the tribunal of the nation, may be inferred from the terms of the amendment.  .  .

 There was not much reason to fear that foreign or sister States would be creditors to any considerable amount, and there was reason to retain the juris *97 diction of the Court in those cases, because it might be essential to the preservation of peace.” Ibid, 17 Nevertheless, this Court later put forth the interest in preventing “indignity” as the “very object and purpose of the [Eleventh] Amendment.” In re Ayers, 123 U. S., at 505 .  That, of course, is an “embarrassingly insufficient” rationale for the rule.  See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 151 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Moreover, I find unsatisfying Justice Holmes’ explanation that “[a] sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal conception or obsolete theory, but on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.” Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, 353 (1907).  As I have explained before, Justice Holmes’ justification fails in at least two respects.  “First, it is nothing more than a restatement of the obvious proposition that a citizen may not sue the sovereign unless the sovereign has violated the citizen’s legal rights.  It cannot explain application of the immunity defense in cases like <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , in which it is assumed that the plaintiff’s rights have in fact been violated— and those cases are, of course, the only ones in which the immunity defense is needed.  Second, Holmes’s statement does not purport to explain why a general grant of jurisdiction to federal courts should not be treated as an adequate expression of the sovereign’s consent to suits against itself as well as to suits against *98 ordinary litigants.” Stevens, Is Justice Irrelevant?, 87 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1121 , 1126 (1993).  In sum, as far as its common-law ancestry is concerned, there is no better reason for the rule of sovereign immunity “than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV.” Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457 , 469 (1897).  That “reason” for the perpetuation of this ancient doctrine certainly cannot justify the majority’s expansion of it.  In this country the sovereignty of the individual States is subordinate both to the citizenry of each State and to the supreme law of the federal sovereign.  For that reason, Justice Holmes’ explanation for a rule that allows a State to avoid suit in its own courts does not even speak to the question whether Congress should be able to authorize a federal court to provide a private remedy for a State’s violation of federal law. In my view, neither the majority’s opinion today, nor any earlier opinion by any Member of the Court, has identified any acceptable reason for concluding that the absence of a State’s consent to be sued in federal court should affect the power of Congress to authorize federal courts to remedy violations of federal law by States or their officials in actions not covered by the Eleventh Amendment’s explicit text.  18 While I am persuaded that there is no justification for permanently enshrining the judge-made law of sovereign immunity, I recognize that federalism concerns — and even the in *99 terest in protecting the solvency of the States that was at work in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> and Hans — may well justify a grant of immunity from federal litigation in certain classes of cases. Such a grant, however, should be the product of a reasoned decision by the policymaking branch of our Government.  For this Court to conclude that timeworn shibboleths iterated and reiterated by judges should take precedence over the deliberations of the Congress of the United States is simply irresponsible.  V Fortunately, and somewhat fortuitously, a jurisdictional problem that is unmentioned by the Court may deprive its opinion of precedential significance.  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act establishes a unique set of procedures for resolving the dispute between the Tribe and the State.  If each adversary adamantly adheres to its understanding of the law, if the District Court determines that the State’s inflexibility constitutes a failure to negotiate in good faith, and if the State thereafter continues to insist that it is acting within its rights, the maximum sanction that the Court can impose is an order that refers the controversy to a member of the Executive Branch of the Government for resolution.  25 U. S. C. § 2710 (d)(7)(B).  As the Court of Appeals interpreted the Act, this final disposition is available even though the action against the State and its Governor may not be maintained.

 The conclusion that suits against States may not be brought in federal court is also incompatible with our cases concluding that state entities may be sued for antitrust violations.  See, e. g., Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 791-792 (1975).  As federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising under these federal laws, the majority’s conclusion that the Eleventh Amend *78 ment shields States from being sued under them in federal court suggests that persons harmed by state violations of federal copyright, bankruptcy, and antitrust laws have no remedy.  See Harris & Kenny, Eleventh Amendment Jurisprudence After Atascadero: The Coming Clash With Antitrust, Copyright, and Other Causes of Action Over Which the Federal Courts Have Exclusive Jurisdiction, 37 Emory L. J. 645 (1988).  Because Justice Iredell read the Judiciary Act of 1789 to have incorporated the common law, he did not even conclude that Congress would have to make a clear statement in order to override the common law’s recognition of sovereign immunity.  Actually, he limited his conclusion to the narrower question whether an action of assumpsit would lie against a State, which he distinguished from the more general question whether a State can ever be sued.  Chisholm v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall. 419, 430</citedDecision> (1793).  He did so because he recognized “that in England, certain judicial proceedings not inconsistent with the sovereignty, may take place against the Crown, but that an action of as-sumpsit will not lie,” and because he had “often found a great deal of confusion to arise from taking too large a view at once.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> In two sentences at the end of his lengthy opinion, Justice Iredell stated that his then-present view was that the Constitution would not permit a “compulsive suit against a State for the recovery of money.” <citedDecision>Id., at 449</citedDecision> .  In light of Justice Iredell’s express statement that the only question before the Court was the propriety of an individual’s action for as-sumpsit against a State, an action which, of course, results in a money judgment, see n. 2, supra, this dicta should not be understood to state the general view that the Constitution bars all suits against unconsenting States.  Moreover, even as to the limited question whether the Constitution permits actions for money judgments, Justice Iredell took pains to reserve ultimate judgment.  <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall., at 449</citedDecision> .  Thus, nothing in Justice Iredell’s two sentences of dicta provides a basis for concluding that Congress lacks the power to authorize the suit for the nonmonetary relief at issue here.  In this respect, <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia</citedDecision> should be understood to be of a piece with the debate over judicial power famously joined in Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 337 (1816).  There, too, the argument centered on whether Congress had the power to limit the seemingly expansive jurisdictional grant that Article III had conferred, not on whether Article III itself provided the relevant limitation.  The contention that Article III withdrew Georgia’s sovereign immunity had special force precisely because <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> involved an action premised on the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction.  While Article III leaves it to Congress to establish the lower federal courts, and to make exceptions to the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction, it specifically mandates that there be a Supreme Court and that it shall be vested with original jurisdiction over those actions in which “a State shall be Party.” Art. Ill, § 2.  In light of that language, the <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> majority’s conclusion that the Supreme Court had a constitutional obligation to take jurisdiction of all suits against States was not implausible.  It should be remembered that at the time of Chisholm, there was a general fear of what Justice Iredell termed the “innovating spirit” of the Federal Judiciary.  See, e. g., 3 A. Beveridge, The Life of John Marshall 19-30 (1919) (discussing the consternation that the federal courts’ creation of common-law felonies engendered).  Thus, there is good reason to believe that the reaction to <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> reflected the popular hostility to the Federal Judiciary more than any desire to restrain the National Legislature.  Of course, even if the Eleventh Amendment applies to federal-question cases brought by a citizen of another State, its express terms pose no bar to a federal court assuming jurisdiction in a federal-question case brought by an in-state plaintiff pursuant to Congress’ express authorization.  As that is precisely the posture of the suit before us, and as it was also precisely the posture of the suit at issue in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas, there is no need to decide here whether Congress would be barred from authorizing out-of-state plaintiffs to enforce federal rights against States in federal court. In fact, Justice Brennan left open that question in his dissent in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 288, n. 41 (1985).  “When the Court is prepared to embark on a defensible interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment consistent with its history and purposes, the question whether the Amendment bars federal-question or admiralty suits by a noncitizen or alien against a State would be open.” Ibid. Under the “plain text” of the Eleventh Amendment, I note that there would appear to be no more basis for the conclusion that States may consent to federal-court jurisdiction in actions brought by out-of-state or foreign citizens than there would be for the view that States should be permitted to consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in a case that poses no federal question.  See, e. g., Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. *83 Kroger, 437 U. S. 365, 377, n. 21 (1978); Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 398 (1975); California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109, 112-113, n. 3 (1972); American Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 U. S. 6, 17-18 , and n. 17 (1951); Mitchell v. Maurer, 293 U. S. 237, 244 (1934); Jackson v. Ashton, 8 Pet. 148, 149 (1834).  We have, however, construed the Amendment, despite its text, to apply only to unconsenting States.  See, e. g., Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436, 447 (1883).
