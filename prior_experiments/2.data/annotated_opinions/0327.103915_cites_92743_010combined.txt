Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 , 134. The fixing of prices, like other applications of the police power, may reduce the value of the property which is being regulated. But the fact that the value is reduced does not mean that the regulation is invalid. Block v. Hirsh, 256 U.S. 135 , 155-157; Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502 , 523-539 and cases cited. It does, however, indicate that "fair value" is the end product of the process of rate-making not the starting point as the Circuit Court of Appeals held. The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to depend upon "fair value" when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated. [9] *602 We held in Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of formulae in determining rates. Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of "pragmatic adjustments." Id., p. 586. And when the Commission's order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order "viewed in its entirety" meets the requirements of the Act. Id., p. 586. Under the statutory standard of "just and reasonable" it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling. Cf.

We held in the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. case that there was no constitutional requirement "that the owner who embarks in a wasting-asset business of limited life shall receive at the end more than he has put into it." 315 U.S. p. 593. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not think that that rule was applicable here because Hope was a utility required to continue its service to the public and not scheduled to end its business on a day certain as was stipulated to be true of the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. But that distinction is quite immaterial. The ultimate exhaustion of the supply is inevitable in the case of all natural gas companies. Moreover, this Court recognized in Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , the propriety of basing annual depreciation on cost. [10] By such a procedure the utility is made whole and the integrity of its investment maintained. [11] No more is required. [12] We cannot approve the contrary holding *607 of United Railways Co. v. West, 280 U.S. 234 , 253-254. Since there are no constitutional requirements more exacting than the standards of the Act, a rate order which conforms to the latter does not run afoul of the former. The Position of West Virginia. The State of West Virginia, as well as its Public Service Commission, intervened in the proceedings before the Commission and participated in the hearings before it.

The outcome of those proceedings may turn on factors other than these findings. These findings may never result in the respondent feeling the pinch of administrative action. Reversed. MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. Opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE MURPHY: We agree with the Court's opinion and would add nothing to what has been said but for what is patently a wholly gratuitous assertion as to Constitutional law in the dissent of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER. We refer to the statement that "Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , may fairly be claimed." That was the case in which a majority of this Court was finally induced to expand the meaning *620 of "due process" so as to give courts power to block efforts of the state and national governments to regulate economic affairs. The present case does not afford a proper occasion to discuss the soundness of that doctrine because, as stated in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S dissent, "that issue is not here in controversy." The salutary practice whereby courts do not discuss issues in the abstract applies with peculiar force to Constitutional questions. Since, however, the dissent adverts to a highly controversial due process doctrine and implies its acceptance by Congress, we feel compelled to say that we do not understand that Congress voluntarily has acquiesced in a Constitutional principle of government that courts, rather than legislative bodies, possess final authority over regulation of economic affairs. Even this Court has not always fully embraced that principle, and we wish to repeat that we have never acquiesced in it, and do not now. See Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., 315 U.S. 575 , 599-601.

The rates were not left to the whim of the Commission. The rates fixed would produce an annual return and that annual return was to be compared with a theoretical just and reasonable return, all risks considered, on the fair value of the property used and useful in the public service at the time of the determination. Such an abstract test is not precise. The agency charged with its determination has a wide range before it could properly be said by a court that the agency had disregarded statutory standards or had confiscated the property of the utility for public use. Cf. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, <targetCase>134 U.S. 418</targetCase> , 461-66, dissent. This is as Congress intends. Rates are left to an experienced agency particularly competent by training to appraise the amount required. The decision as to a reasonable return had not been a source of great difficulty, for borrowers and lenders reached such agreements daily in a multitude of situations; and although the determination of fair value had been troublesome, its essentials had been worked out in fairness to investor and consumer by the time of the enactment *622 of this Act. Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 289 U.S. 287 , 304 et seq. The results were well known to Congress and had that body desired to depart from the traditional concepts of fair value and earnings, it would have stated its intention plainly.

His exposition seems to me unanswered, and I shall say only a few words to emphasize my basic agreement with him. For our society the needs that are met by public utilities are as truly public services as the traditional governmental functions of police and justice. They are not less so when these services are rendered by private enterprise under governmental regulation. Who ultimately determines the ways of regulation, is the decisive aspect in the public supervision of privately-owned utilities. Foreshadowed nearly sixty years ago, Railroad Commission Cases, 116 U.S. 307 , 331, it was decided more than fifty years ago that the final say under the Constitution lies with the judiciary and not the legislature. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, <targetCase>134 U.S. 418</targetCase> . While legal issues touching the proper distribution of governmental powers under the Constitution may always be raised, Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> , may fairly be claimed. But in any event that issue is not here in controversy. As pointed out in the opinions of my brethren, Congress has given only limited authority to the Federal Power Commission and made the exercise of that authority subject to judicial review. The Commission is authorized to fix rates chargeable for natural gas. But the rates that it can fix must be "just and reasonable." § 5 of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. § 717 (d).

Natural gas at 2.00 per M. is equivalent to gasoline at 27¢ per gal. Natural gas at 2.20 per M. is equivalent to electricity at 3¢ per k.w.h. Natural gas at 2.40 per M. is equivalent to coal oil at 15¢ per gal. Use and Conservation of Natural Gas, issued by U.S. Fuel Administration (1918) 5.
