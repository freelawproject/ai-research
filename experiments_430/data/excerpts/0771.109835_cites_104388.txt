 5 Revised Rule 193D restores the original scope of the Washington business and occupation tax. After initial imposition *739 of the tax in 1935, 6 the then State Tax Commission 7 adopted Rule 198 of the Rules and Regulations Relating to the Revenue Act of 1935.  8 That Rule permitted taxpayers to deduct certain income received from interstate and foreign commerce.  Income from stevedoring, however, was not described as deductible.  When, in 1937, this Court in Puget Sound invalidated the application of the tax to stevedoring, the Commission complied by adding stevedoring income to the list of *740 deductions.  9 The deduction for stevedoring remained in effect until the revision of Rule 193 in 1974.  10 Seeking to retain their theretofore-enjoyed exemption from the tax, respondents in January 1975 sought from the Superior Court of Thurston County, Wash., a declaratory judgment to the effect that Revised Rule 193D violated both the Commerce Clause and the Import-Export Clause.  They urged that the case was controlled by Puget Sound, which this Court had reaffirmed in Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., <citedDecision>330 U. S. 422, 433</citedDecision> (1947) (together, the Stevedoring Cases).  Absent a clear invitation from this Court, respondents submitted that the Superior Court could not avoid the force of the Stevedoring Cases, which had never been overruled.  Record 9.  11 Petitioner replied that this Court had invited rejection *741 of those cases by casting doubt on the Commerce Clause analysis that distinguished between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce.  Id., at 25-37, citing, e. g., Interstate Pipe Line Co. v. Stone, 337 U. S. 662 (1949); Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938).  Petitioner also argued that the Rule did not violate- the Commerce Clause because it taxed only intrastate activity, namely, the loading and unloading of ships, Record 17-20, and because it levied only a nondiscriminatory tax apportioned to the activity within the State.  Id., at 20-22.

 434 U. S. 815 (1977).  II The Commerce Clause A In Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n , the Court invalidated the Washington business and occupation tax on stevedoring only because it applied directly to interstate commerce.  Stevedoring was interstate commerce, according to the Court, because: “Transportation of a cargo by water is impossible or futile unless the thing to be transported is put Aboard the ship and taken off at destination.  A stevedore who in person or by servants does work so indispensable is as much an agency of commerce as shipowner or master.” 302 U. S., at 92 .  Without further analysis, the Court concluded: “The business of loading and unloading being interstate or foreign commerce, the State of Washington is not at liberty to tax the privilege of doing it by exacting in return therefor a percentage of the gross receipts.  Decisions to that effect are many and controlling.” Id., at 94 .  The petitioners (officers of New York City) in <citedDecision>Joseph</citedDecision> v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., urged the Court to overrule Puget Sound.  They argued that intervening cases 14 had per *744 mitted local taxation of gross proceeds derived from interstate commerce.  They concluded, therefore, that the Commerce Clause did not preclude the application to stevedoring of the New York City business tax on the gross receipts of a stevedoring corporation.  The Court disagreed on the theory that the intervening cases permitted taxation only of local activity separate and distinct from interstate commerce.  <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 430-433</citedDecision> .  This separation theory was necessary, said the Court, because it served to diminish the threat of multiple taxation on commerce; if the tax actually fell on intrastate activity, there was less likelihood that other taxing jurisdictions could duplicate the levy.  <citedDecision>Id., at 429</citedDecision> .  Stevedoring, however, was not separated from interstate commerce because, as previously enunciated in Puget Sound, it was interstate commerce: “Stevedoring, we conclude, is essentially a part of the commerce itself and therefore a tax upon its gross receipts or upon the privilege of conducting the business of stevedoring for interstate and foreign commerce, measured by those gross receipts, is invalid.  We reaffirm the rule of Puget Sound Stevedoring Company.  What makes the *745 tax invalid is the fact that there is interference by a State with the freedom of interstate commerce.’ Freeman v. Hewit [ 329 U. S. 249 ,] 256.” <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 433</citedDecision> .  Because the tax in the present case is indistinguishable from the taxes at issue in Puget Sound and in Carter & Weekes, the Stevedoring Cases control today’s decision on the Commerce Clause issue unless more recent precedent and a new analysis require rejection of their reasoning.  We conclude that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady , where the Court held that a State under appropriate conditions may tax directly the privilege of conducting interstate business, requires such rejection.  In Complete Auto, Mississippi levied a gross-receipts tax on the privilege of doing business within the State.  It applied the tax to the appellant, a Michigan corporation transporting motor vehicles manufactured outside Mississippi.  After the vehicles were shipped into Mississippi by railroad, the appellant moved them by truck to Mississippi dealers.  This Court assumed that appellant’s activity was in interstate commerce.
**Lead Opinion**
 But Complete Auto recognized that errors of apportionment that may lead to multiple burdens may be corrected when they occur.  430 U. S., at 288-289, n. 15 .  16 The argument of Carter ■& Weekes was an abstraction.  No multiple burdens were demonstrated.  When a general business tax levies only on the value of services performed within the State, the tax is properly apportioned and multiple bur *747 dens logically cannot occur.  17 The reasoning of Carter & Weekes, therefore, no longer supports automatic tax immunity for stevedoring from a levy such as the Washington business and occupation tax. Third, Carter & Weekes reaffirmed Puget Sound on a basis rejected by Complete Auto and previous cases. Carter & Weekes considered any direct tax on interstate commerce to be unconstitutional because it burdened or interfered with commerce.  <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 433</citedDecision> .  In support of that conclusion, the Court there cited only Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761, 767 (1945), the case where Arizona’s limitations on the length of trains were invalidated.  In Southern Pacific, however, the Court had not struck down the legislation merely because it burdened interstate commerce.  Instead, it weighed the burden against the State’s interests in limiting the size of trains: “The decisive question is whether in the circumstances the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free .  .  .  .” Id., at 775-776 .

 The situation was the same in Complete Auto, and that case, thus, is not distinguishable from the present one.  Third, respondents suggest that what they regard as such an important change in Commerce Clause jurisprudence should come from Congress and not from this Court. To begin with, our rejection of the Stevedoring Cases does not effect a significant present change in the law. The primary alteration occurred in Complete Auto. Even if this case did effect an important change, it would not offend the sepa.ration-of-powers principle because it does not restrict the ability of Congress to regulate commerce.  The Commerce Clause does not state a prohibition; it merely grants specific power to Congress.  The prohibitive effect of the Clause on state legislation results from the Supremacy Clause and the decisions of this Court. See, e. g., Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1852); Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824).  If Congress prefers less disruption of interstate commerce, it will act.  18 Consistent with Complete Auto, then, we hold that the Washington business and occupation tax does not violate the *750 Commerce Clause by taxing the interstate commerce activity of stevedoring.  To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n and <citedDecision>Joseph</citedDecision> v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. stand to the contrary, each is overruled.  C With the distinction between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce thus discarded, the constitutionality under the Commerce Clause of the application of the Washington business and occupation tax to stevedoring depends upon the practical effect of the exaction.  As was recognized in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938), interstate commerce must bear its fair share of the state tax burden.  The Court repeatedly has sustained taxes that are applied to activity with a substantial nexus with the State, that are fairly apportioned, that do not discriminate against interstate commerce, and that are fairly related to the services provided by the State.  E. g., General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436 (1964); Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959); Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, 335 U. S. 80 (1948); Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435 (1940); see Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., at 279 , and n. 8.  Respondents proved no facts in the Superior Court that, under the above test, would justify invalidation of the Washington tax. The record contains nothing that minimizes the obvious nexus between Washington and respondents; indeed, respondents conduct their entire stevedoring operations within the State.  Nor have respondents successfully attacked the apportionment of the Washington system.

 Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Board, 329 U. S. 69, 75 (1946).  On the other hand, the Commerce Clause touches all state taxation and regulation of interstate and foreign commerce, whereas the Import-Export Clause bans only “Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports.” Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276, 279, 290-294 (1976).  The resolution of the Commerce Clause issue, therefore, does not dispose of the Import-Export Clause question.  A In Michelin the Court upheld the application of a general ad valorem property tax to imported tires and tubes.  The Court surveyed the history and purposes of the Import-Export-Clause to determine, for the first time, which taxes fell within the absolute ban on “Imposts or Duties.” Id., at 283-286 .  *752 Previous eases had assumed that all taxes on imports and exports and on the importing and exporting processes were banned by the Clause.  See, e. g., Department of Revenue v. James B. Beam Distilling Co., 377 U. S. 341, 343 (1964); Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Board, 329 U. S., at 76 ; <citedDecision>Joseph</citedDecision> v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 445</citedDecision> (Douglas, J., dissenting in part); Anglo-Chilean Corp. v. Alabama, 288 U. S. 218, 226-227 (1933); License Cases, 5 How. 504, 575-576 (1847) (opinion of Taney, C. J.).  Before Michelin, the primary consideration was whether the tax under review reached imports or exports.  With respect to imports, the analysis applied the original-package doctrine of Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419 (1827); see, e. g., Department of Revenue v. James B. Beam Distilling Co.; Anglo-Chilean Corp. v. Alabama; Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29 (1872), overruled in Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages .  So long as the goods retained their status as imports by remaining in their import packages, they enjoyed immunity from state taxation.  With respect to exports, the dispositive question was whether the goods had entered the “export stream,” the final, continuous journey out of the country.  Kosydar v. National Cash Register Co., 417 U. S. 62, 70-71 (1974); Empresa Siderurgica v. County of Merced, 337 U. S. 154, 157 (1949); A. G. Spalding & Bros. v. Edwards, 262 U. S. 66, 69 (1923); Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 526, 527 (1886).  As soon as the journey began, tax immunity attached.
**Lead Opinion**
 As a result, any tax relating to exports can be tested for its conformance with the first and third policies.  If the constitutional interests are not disturbed, the tax should not be considered an “Impost or Duty” any more than should a tax related to imports.  This approach is consistent with Canton R. Co., which permitted taxation of income, from services connected to both imports and exports.  The respondents’ gross receipts from loading exports, therefore, are as subject to the Washington business and occupation tax as are the receipts from unloading imports.  *759 D None of respondents’ additional arguments convinces us that the Michelin approach should not be applied in this case to sustain the tax. First, respondents contend that the Import-Export Clause effects an absolute prohibition on all taxation of imports and exports.  The ban must be absolute, they argue, in order to give the Clause meaning apart from the Commerce Clause.  They support this contention primarily with dicta from Rich-field Oil, 329 U. S., at 75-78, and with the partial dissent in Carter & Weekes, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 444-445</citedDecision> .  Neither, however, provides persuasive support because neither recognized that the term “Impost or Duty” is not self-defining and does not necessarily encompass all taxes.  The partial dissent in Carter & Weekes did not address the term at all. Richfield Oil’s discussion was limited to the question whether the tax fell upon the sale or upon the right to retail.  329 U. S., at 83-84.  The State apparently conceded that the Clause precluded all taxes on exports and the process of exporting.  Id., at 84.  The use of these two cases, therefore, ignores the central holding of Michelin that the absolute ban is only of “Imposts or Duties” and not of all taxes.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Powell, concurring in part and concurring in the result. I join the opinion of the Court with the exception of Part 1II-B. As that section of the Court’s opinion appears to *762 resurrect the discarded “direct-indirect” test, I cannot join it. In Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276 (1976), this Court abandoned the traditional, formalistic methods of determining the validity of state levies under the Import-Export Clause and applied a functional analysis based on the exaction’s relationship to the three policies that underlie the Clause: (i) preservation of uniform federal regulation of foreign relations; (ii) protection of federal revenue derived from imports; and (iii) maintenance of harmony among the inland States and the seaboard States. The nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax in Michelin was held not to violate any of those policies, but the Court suggested that even a nondiscriminatory tax on goods merely in transit through the State might run afoul of the Import-Export Clause. The question the Court addresses today in Part III-B is whether the business tax at issue here is such a tax upon goods in transit. The Court gives a negative answer, apparently for two reasons. The first is that Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511 (1951), indicates that this is a tax “not on the goods but on the handling of them at the port.” Id., at 514 (emphasis in original). While Canton R. Co. provides precedential support for the proposition that a tax of this kind is not invalid under the Import-Export Clause, its rather artificial distinction between taxes on the handling of the goods and taxes on the goods themselves harks back to the arid “direct-indirect” distinction that we rejected in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., 274 (1977), in favor of analysis framed in light of economic reality. The Court’s second reason for holding that the instant tax is not one on goods in transit has the surface appearance of economic-reality analysis, but turns out to be the “direct-indirect” test in another guise. The Court likens this tax to the one at issue in Canton R. Co. and declares that since “ [t] axation in neither setting relates to the value of the goods,... in neither can it be considered taxation upon the goods themselves.” *763 Ante, at 757. That this distinction has no economic significance is apparent from the fact that it is possible to design transit fees that are imposed “directly” upon the goods, even though the amount of the exaction bears no relation to the value of the goods. For example, a State could levy a transit fee of $5 per ton or $10 per cubic yard. These taxes would bear no more relation to the value of the goods than does the tax at issue here, which is based on the volume of the stevedoring companies’ business, and, in turn, on the volume of goods passing through the port. Thus, the Court does not explain satisfactorily its pronouncement that Washington’s business tax upon stevedoring — in economic terms — is not the type of transit fee that the Michelin Court questioned. In my view, this issue can be resolved only with reference to the analysis adopted in Michelin. The Court’s initial mention of the validity of transit fees in that decision is found in a discussion concerning the right of the taxing state to seek a quid pro quo for benefits conferred by the State: “There is no reason why local taxpayers should subsidize the services used by the importer; ultimate consumers should pay for such services as police and fire protection accorded the goods just as much as they should pay transportation costs associated with those goods. An evil to be prevented by the Import-Export Clause was the levying of taxes which could only be imposed because of the peculiar geographical situation of certain States that enabled them to single out goods destined for other States. In effect, the Clause was fashioned to prevent the imposition of exactions which were no more than transit fees on the privilege of moving through a State. [The tax at issue] obviously stands on a different footing, and to the extent there is any conflict whatsoever with this purpose of the Clause, it may be secured merely by prohibiting the assessment of even nondiscriminatory property taxes on goods which are merely in transit through the State when *764 the tax is assessed.” 423 U. S., at 289-290 . (Footnotes omitted.) In questioning the validity of “transit fees,” the Michelin Court was concerned with exactions that bore no relation to services and benefits conferred by the State. Thus, the transit-fee inquiry cannot be answered by determining whether or not the tax relates to the value of the goods; instead, it must be answered by inquiring whether the State is simply making the imported goods pay their own way, as opposed to exacting a fee merely for “the privilege of moving through a State.” Ibid. The Court already has answered that question in this case. In Part II-C; the Court observes that “nothing in the record suggests that the tax is not fairly related to services and protection provided by the State.” Ante, at 750-751. Since the stevedoring companies undoubtedly avail themselves of police and fire protection, as well as other benefits Washington offers its local businesses, this statement cannot be questioned. For that reason, I agree with the Court’s conclusion that the business tax at issue here is not a “transit fee” within the prohibition of the Import-Export Clause.
**Combined Opinion**
 [5] Revised Rule 193D restores the original scope of the Washington business and occupation tax. After initial imposition *739 of the tax in 1935, [6] the then State Tax Commission [7] adopted Rule 198 of the Rules and Regulations Relating to the Revenue Act of 1935.  [8] That Rule permitted taxpayers to deduct certain income received from interstate and foreign commerce.  Income from stevedoring, however, was not described as deductible.  When, in 1937, this Court in Puget Sound invalidated the application of the tax to stevedoring, the Commission complied by adding stevedoring income to the list of *740 deductions.  [9] The deduction for stevedoring remained in effect until the revision of Rule 193 in 1974.  [10] Seeking to retain their theretofore-enjoyed exemption from the tax, respondents in January 1975 sought from the Superior Court of Thurston County, Wash., a declaratory judgment to the effect that Revised Rule 193D violated both the Commerce Clause and the Import-Export Clause.  They urged that the case was controlled by Puget Sound, which this Court had reaffirmed in Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., <citedDecision>330 U. S. 422, 433</citedDecision> (1947) (together, the Stevedoring Cases ).  Absent a clear invitation from this Court, respondents submitted that the Superior Court could not avoid the force of the Stevedoring Cases, which had never been overruled.  Record 9.  [11] Petitioner replied that this Court had invited rejection *741 of those cases by casting doubt on the Commerce Clause analysis that distinguished between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce.  Id., at 25-37, citing, e. g., Interstate Pipe Line Co. v. Stone, 337 U. S. 662 (1949); Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938).  Petitioner also argued that the Rule did not violate the Commerce Clause because it taxed only intrastate activity, namely, the loading and unloading of ships, Record 17-20, and because it levied only a nondiscriminatory tax apportioned to the activity within the State.  Id., at 20-22.
**Combined Opinion**
 Stevedoring was interstate commerce, according to the Court, because: "Transportation of a cargo by water is impossible or futile unless the thing to be transported is put aboard the ship and taken off at destination.  A stevedore who in person or by servants does work so indispensable is as much an agency of commerce as shipowner or master." 302 U. S., at 92 .  Without further analysis, the Court concluded: "The business of loading and unloading being interstate or foreign commerce, the State of Washington is not at liberty to tax the privilege of doing it by exacting in return therefor a percentage of the gross receipts.  Decisions to that effect are many and controlling." Id., at 94 .  The petitioners (officers of New York City) in <citedDecision>Joseph</citedDecision> v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co ., urged the Court to overrule Puget Sound.  They argued that intervening cases [14] had permitted *744 local taxation of gross proceeds derived from interstate commerce.  They concluded, therefore, that the Commerce Clause did not preclude the application to stevedoring of the New York City business tax on the gross receipts of a stevedoring corporation.  The Court disagreed on the theory that the intervening cases permitted taxation only of local activity separate and distinct from interstate commerce.  <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 430-433</citedDecision> .  This separation theory was necessary, said the Court, because it served to diminish the threat of multiple taxation on commerce; if the tax actually fell on intrastate activity, there was less likelihood that other taxing jurisdictions could duplicate the levy.  <citedDecision>Id., at 429</citedDecision> .  Stevedoring, however, was not separated from interstate commerce because, as previously enunciated in Puget Sound, it was interstate commerce: "Stevedoring, we conclude, is essentially a part of the commerce itself and therefore a tax upon its gross receipts or upon the privilege of conducting the business of stevedoring for interstate and foreign commerce, measured by those gross receipts, is invalid.  We reaffirm the rule of Puget Sound Stevedoring Company.  `What makes the *745 tax invalid is the fact that there is interference by a State with the freedom of interstate commerce.' Freeman v.

Because the tax in the present case is indistinguishable from the taxes at issue in Puget Sound and in Carter & Weekes, the Stevedoring Cases control today's decision on the Commerce Clause issue unless more recent precedent and a new analysis require rejection of their reasoning.  We conclude that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady , where the Court held that a State under appropriate conditions may tax directly the privilege of conducting interstate business, requires such rejection.  In Complete Auto, Mississippi levied a gross-receipts tax on the privilege of doing business within the State.  It applied the tax to the appellant, a Michigan corporation transporting motor vehicles manufactured outside Mississippi.  After the vehicles were shipped into Mississippi by railroad, the appellant moved them by truck to Mississippi dealers.  This Court assumed that appellant's activity was in interstate commerce.

[18] Consistent with Complete Auto, then, we hold that the Washington business and occupation tax does not violate the *750 Commerce Clause by taxing the interstate commerce activity of stevedoring.

A In Michelin the Court upheld the application of a general ad valorem property tax to imported tires and tubes.  The Court surveyed the history and purposes of the Import-Export Clause to determine, for the first time, which taxes fell within the absolute ban on "Imposts or Duties." Id., at 283-286 .  *752 Previous cases had assumed that all taxes on imports and exports and on the importing and exporting processes were banned by the Clause.  See, e. g., Department of Revenue v.

So long as the goods retained their status as imports by remaining in their import packages, they enjoyed immunity from state taxation.  With respect to exports, the dispositive question was whether the goods had entered the "export stream," the final, continuous journey out of the country.  Kosydar v. National Cash Register Co., 417 U. S. 62, 70-71 (1974); Empresa Siderurgica v. County of Merced, 337 U. S. 154, 157 (1949); A. G. Spalding & Bros. v. Edwards, 262 U. S. 66, 69 (1923); Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 526, 527 (1886).
**Combined Opinion**
 As a result, any tax relating to exports can be tested for its conformance with the first and third policies.  If the constitutional interests are not disturbed, the tax should not be considered an "Impost or Duty" any more than should a tax related to imports.  This approach is consistent with Canton R. Co., which permitted taxation of income from services connected to both imports and exports.  The respondents' gross receipts from loading exports, therefore, are as subject to the Washington business and occupation tax as are the receipts from unloading imports.  *759 D None of respondents' additional arguments convinces us that the Michelin approach should not be applied in this case to sustain the tax. First, respondents contend that the Import-Export Clause effects an absolute prohibition on all taxation of imports and exports.  The ban must be absolute, they argue, in order to give the Clause meaning apart from the Commerce Clause.  They support this contention primarily with dicta from Richfield Oil, 329 U. S., at 75-78 , and with the partial dissent in Carter & Weekes, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 444-445</citedDecision> .  Neither, however, provides persuasive support because neither recognized that the term "Impost or Duty" is not self-defining and does not necessarily encompass all taxes.  The partial dissent in Carter & Weekes did not address the term at all. Richfield Oil's discussion was limited to the question whether the tax fell upon the sale or upon the right to retail.  329 U. S., at 83-84.  The State apparently conceded that the Clause precluded all taxes on exports and the process of exporting.  Id., at 84.  The use of these two cases, therefore, ignores the central holding of Michelin that the absolute ban is only of "Imposts or Duties" and not of all taxes.
**Combined Opinion**
 The fourth was Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938).  There the Court upheld a New Mexico privilege tax upon the gross receipts from the sale of advertising.  It concluded that the business was local even though a magazine with interstate circulation and advertising was published.  [15]  That the holding in Spector parallels that in Puget Sound is demonstrated by the authorities relied upon or provided by both cases in the past.  Spector relied on Carter & Weekes, which reaffirmed Puget Sound, and upon Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249 (1946).  340 U. S., at 609.  Freeman, in turn, relied upon Puget Sound, 329 U. S., at 257, and Carter & Weekes relied upon Freeman, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 433</citedDecision> .  Both Freeman and Puget Sound relied upon Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, 210 U. S. 217 (1908).  329 U. S., at 257; 302 U. S., at 94 .  Respondents, also, have observed the parallel between Spector and the Stevedoring Cases. In their reply brief to the Superior Court, they argued that Spector, which had not then been overruled by Complete Auto, was dispositive on the question of the continued vitality of Puget Sound and Carter & Weekes.  See n. 11, supra. [16]  Subsequent to Carter & Weekes, the Court explained more precisely its concern about multiple burdens on interstate commerce: "While the economic wisdom of state net income taxes is one of state policy not for our decision, one of the `realities' raised by the parties is the possibility of a multiple burden resulting from the exactions in question.  The answer is that none is shown to exist here.  .
