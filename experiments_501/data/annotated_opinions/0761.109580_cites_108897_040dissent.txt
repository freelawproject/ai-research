Mr. Justice Marshall, with whom Mr. Justice White joins, dissenting.  The Court today overrules a three-year-old decision, Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, <citedDecision>414 U. S. 313</citedDecision> (1973), in which *383 seven of the eight participating Justices joined.  In addition, as the Court is certain to announce when the occasion arises, today’s holding also overrules Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290 (1967), a nine-year-old decision also joined by all but one of the participating Justices.  1 It is surprising, to say the least, to find these nearly unanimous recent decisions swept away in the name of stare decisis.  See ante, at 381-382.  The public, especially holders of riparian or littoral prop *384 erty whose titles derive from the United States, deserve some explanation for the Court’s change of course.  Yet today’s majority does not contend either that circumstances have changed since 1973 or that experience has shown Hughes and Bonelli to be unworkable.  Nor does the majority attempt to explain why a result it finds so clearly commanded by our earlier cases was almost unanimously rejected by this Court twice in the last decade.  We are left, then, with a mystery.  I respectfully suggest that the solution to this puzzle is not hard to find.  In contrast to the Bonelli and Hughes Courts, the Court today decides a question the parties did not present, 2 brief, 3 or argue.  4 By so doing, the Court rules *385 without the benefit of “that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.” Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962).  The lack of illumination has caused the Court to choose the wrong path.  I The question the Court elects to 'decide in this case is whether a grant of riparian 5 land by the Federal Government is to be interpreted according to federal or state law. The Court holds that federal law governs only the determination of the initial boundaries of the grant; all other questions are to be determined under state law. This conclusion *386 depends on an unjustifiably limited interpretation of the meaning of a riparian grant.  It is undisputed that “the quality of being riparian” is perhaps “the land’s 'most valuable feature’ and is part and parcel of the ownership of the land itself.” Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, <citedDecision>414 U. S., at 326</citedDecision> , quoting Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S., at 293 .  Cf. New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 , 717 (1836), In the natural course, however, a riparian boundary tends to move, a fact reflected in the common-law doctrines of accretion, avulsion, erosion, and reliction.  Prior to today’s ruling, federal grantees of riparian land, and holders under them, correctly understood that their titles incorporated boundaries whose precise location would depend on the movements of the water and on the federal common law. There can be no doubt that the federal grantee’s expectation that his grant would be interpreted according to federal law and his belief that federal law would recognize boundary shifts occasioned by changes in the course of the water bordering his land were well founded.  One hundred forty years ago, this Court found it obvious that whoever had title to the land bordering water would have title to new land formed by alluvial deposits on the existing upland: “The question is well settled at common law, that the person whose land is bounded by a stream of water, which changes its course gradually by alluvial formations, shall still hold by the same boundary, including the accumulated soil.  No other rule can be applied on just principles.  Every proprietor whose land is thus bounded is subject to loss, by the same means which may add to his territory: and as he is without remedy for his loss, in this way, he cannot be held accountable for his gain.” Ibid, (emphasis added).  This statement of the law was quoted by the Court in County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 68 (1874).

 14 See, e. g., Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 382 U. S. 810 (1965); Yiatchos v. Yiatchos, 372 U. S. 905 (1963).  We followed this practice in both Bonelli, 409 U. S. 1022 (1972), and Hughes, 385 U. S. 807 (1966), and the Solicitor General participated as an amicus in both cases. Today’s majority has made no similar effort to inform itself about the impact of its ruling on the Federal Government.  Indeed, the majority opinion does not even consider that issue, although it is normally central to a choice-of-law decision.  As the opinion and result show, the only views the Court has received are those of the amici States, whose interests here are hostile to those of the United States.  I cannot, of course, know what the Solicitor General would have said had the Court indicated that it was considering a choice-of-law question and invited him to present the views of the Government.  In both Bonelli and Hughes , however, the submissions for the United States as amicus curiae strongly urged the Court to hold that federal rather *393 than state law governed the case. In Bonelli, the Government noted that its quiet enjoyment of the more than 200 miles of Colorado River shoreline it owned in Arizona had been threatened by some interpretations of the state court’s decision.  Memorandum for the United States as Amicus Curiae 1-2, filed Sept. 20, 1973, in Bonelli Cattle Co. v. <citedDecision>Arizona</citedDecision> , O. T. 1973, No. 72-397.  The Government urged that the state-court opinion be given a narrow interpretation and affirmed as consistent with the applicable federal law. Id., at 3-5.  In Hughes , the Government urged that the decision of the State Supreme Court be reversed.  The Solicitor General explained that the Government considered that decision a serious threat: "The decision is of broad consequence.  It trenches on a significant element of title to realty acquired from the United States in the past and it materially curtails the nature of the title that the United States may convey in the future.  .  .

 I therefore respectfully disssent.  Although the Court rejects the reasoning on which Hughes is based, it refrains from formally overruling Hughes on the ground that that case was not relied on in Bonelli and not cited by the Oregon courts below.  Ante, at 377 n. 6.  In Bonelli, the Solicitor General urged the Court to find federal law controlling because riparian lands patented by the United States were involved and, under Hughes , federal common law therefore controlled the riparian rights of the landowner.  Memorandum for United States as Amicus Curiae 3-4, filed Jan. 2, 1973; and Memorandum for United States as Amicus Curiae 2-3, filed Sept. 20, 1973, in Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, O. T. 1973, No. 72-397.  The petitioner took the same position.  Brief for Petitioners 31-34 in Bonelli Cattle Co. v. <citedDecision>Arizona, supra.</citedDecision> The Bonelli Court did not reach this contention, noting that there was some doubt that the land in question was riparian at the time of the federal patent.  <citedDecision>414 U. S., at 321</citedDecision> n. 11.  In its eagerness to do away with Bonelli’s result as well as its approach, however, today’s opinion explicitly concludes that had Bonelli relied on the theory advocated by the petitioner there and the Solicitor General, it would now be rejected.  Ante, at 371-372, 378-381.  Nevertheless, the majority suggests that Hughes might still control oceanfront property.  Ante, at 377 n. 6.  It is difficult to take seriously the suggestion that the national interest in international relations justifies applying'a different rule to oceanfront land grants than to other grants by the Federal Government.  It is clear that the States have complete title to the lands below the line of mean high tide.
