 Ch. 162, Sess. Laws, 1915: Ch. 66, Art. 5, Sess. Laws.  1935.  It is unnecessary to consider the State’s argument that Congress is without power to exempt these estates from taxation.  This issue is not foreclosed by Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U. S. 705 , since there we decided no more than that Congress might authorize the exemption of certain Indian lands from taxation because of an historic policy in respect to those lands.  Cf. McCurdy v. United States, 246 U.S. 263, 269 .  Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665 , holding that under certain circumstances the United States could not withdraw a tax exemption once assured, has no bearing on the instant problem since it is conceded that the question here is entirely one of what Congress has in fact directed.
