Mr. Justice Stewart delivered the opinion of the Court. More than a century ago, in The Schooner Catharine v. Dickinson, <citedDecision>17 How. 170</citedDecision> , this Court established in our admiralty law the rule of divided damages.  That rule, most commonly applied in cases of collision between two vessels, requires the equal division of property damage whenever both parties are found to be guilty of contributing fault, whatever the relative degree of their fault may have been.  The courts of every major maritime *398 nation except ours have long since abandoned that rule, and now assess damages in such cases on the basis of proportionate fault when such an allocation can reasonably be made.  In the present case we are called upon to decide whether this country’s admiralty rule of divided damages should be replaced by a rule requiring, when possible, the allocation of liability for damages in proportion to the relative fault of each party.  I On a clear but windy December night in 1968, the Mary A. Whalen, a coastal tanker owned by the respondent Reliable Transfer Co., embarked from Constable Hook, N. J., for Island Park, N. Y., with a load of fuel oil.  The voyage ended, instead, with the vessel stranded on a sand bar off Rockaway Point outside New York Harbor.  The Whalen’s course led across the mouth of Rock-away Inlet, a narrow body of water that lies between a breakwater to the southeast and the shoreline of Coney Island to the northwest.

 recognizing] the force of the argument *401 that in this type of case division of damages in proportion to the degree of fault may be more equitable,” id., at 1038 , the appellate court felt constrained to adhere to the established rule and “to leave doctrinal development to the Supreme Court or to await appropriate action by Congress.” Ibid. We granted certiorari, 419 U. S. 1018 , to consider the continued validity of the divided damages rule.  2 II The precise origins of the divided damages rule are shrouded in the mists of history.  3 In any event it was *402 not until early in the 19th century that the divided damages rule as we know it emerged clearly in British admiralty law. In 1815, in The Woodrop-Sims, 2 Dods.  83, 165 Eng. Rep. 1422, Sir William Scott, later Lord Stowell, considered the various circumstances under which maritime collisions could occur and stated that division of damages was appropriate in those cases “where both parties are to blame.” Id., at 85, 165 Eng. Rep., at 1423.  In such cases the total damages were to be “apportioned between” the parties “as having been occasioned by the fault of both of them.” Ibid. Nine years later the divided damages rule became settled in English admiralty law when the House of Lords in a maritime collision case where both ships were at fault reversed a decision of a Scottish court that had apportioned damages by degree of blame, and, relying on The Woodrop-Sims, ordered that the damages be divided equally.  Hay v. Le Neve, 2 Shaw H. L. 395.  It was against this background that in 1855 this Court adopted the rule of equal division of damages in The Schooner Catharine v. Dickinson, <citedDecision>17 How. 170</citedDecision> .  The rule was adopted because it was then the prevailing rule in England, because it had become the majority rule in the lower federal courts, and because it seemed the “most just and equitable, and .  .  .  best [tended] to in *403 duce care and vigilance on both sides, in the navigation.” <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 177-178</citedDecision> .  There can be no question that subsequent history and experience have conspicuously eroded the rule’s foundations.  4 It was true at the time of The Catharine that the divided damages rule was well entrenched in English law. The rule was an ancient form of rough justice, a means of apportioning damages where it was difficult to measure which party was more at fault.  See 4 R. Marsden, British Shipping Laws, Collisions at Sea §§ 119-147 (11th ed. 1961); Staring, Contribution and Division of Damages in Admiralty and Maritime Cases, 45 Calif-.  L. Rev. 304, 305-310 (1957).  But England has long since abandoned the rule 5 and now follows the Brussels Collision Liability Convention of 1910 that provides for the apportionment of damages on the basis of “degree” of fault whenever it is possible to do so. 6 Indeed, the United States is now virtually alone among the world’s major maritime nations in not adhering to the Convention with its rule of pro *404 portional fault 7 — a fact that encourages transoceanic forum shopping.  See G. Gilmore & C. Black, The Law of Admiralty 529 (2d ed. 1975) (hereinafter Gilmore & Black).

 .  .  can have no relevance in respect to such a rule; the concept of ‘settled expectation’ would be reduced to an absurdity were it to be applied to a rule of damages for negligent collision.  The abrogation of the rule would not, it seems, produce any disharmony with other branches of the maritime law, general or statutory.” Gilmore & Black 531 (footnote omitted).  16 The rule of divided damages in admiralty has continued to prevail in this country by sheer inertia rather than by reason of any intrinsic merit.  The reasons that originally led to the Court’s adoption of the rule have long since disappeared.  The rule has been repeatedly criticized by experienced federal judges who have cor *411 rectly pointed out that the result it works has too often been precisely the opposite of what the Court sought to achieve in <citedDecision>The Schooner Catharine</citedDecision> — the “just and equitable” allocation of damages.  And worldwide experience has taught that that goal can be more nearly realized by a standard that allocates liability for damages according to comparative fault whenever possible.  We hold that when two or more parties have contributed by their fault to cause property damage in a maritime collision or stranding, liability for such damage is to be allocated among the parties proportionately to the comparative degree of their fault, and that liability for such damages is to be allocated equally only when the parties are equally at fault or when it is not possible fairly to measure the comparative degree of their fault.  Accordingly, the judgment before us is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  1 The operation of the rule was described in The Sapphire, 18 Wall. 51 , 56: “It is undoubtedly the rule in admiralty that where both vessels are in fault the sums representing the damage sustained by each must be added together and the aggregate divided between the two.  This is in effect deducting the lesser from the greater and dividing the remainder.
