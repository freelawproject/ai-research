**Combined Opinion**
In that case it was said: "Subdivision 4 of section 33 of the Public Service Commissions Law (Consol. Laws, chap. 48 [Laws of 1910, chap. 480], as amd. by Laws of 1911, chap. 546) empowers the Commission to fix reasonable and just rates for such service. It is urged, however, that the statute is invalid under the rule of Lake Shore &c. R. Co. v. Smith ( <targetCase>173 U.S. 684</targetCase> ). In that case the statutes of Michigan had fixed a maximum passenger rate at three cents per mile. A subsequent enactment required the issuing of mileage books for 1,000 miles, good for two years, at a less rate. The court held that having fixed a uniform maximum rate as to all passengers, such rate was the reasonable compensation for the service, and that the fixing of a less rate to particular individuals was an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of legislative power; that it was not for the convenience of the public and thus within the police power, but was for the convenience of certain individuals who were permitted to travel upon the railroads for less than the reasonable rate prescribed by law; that the law was, therefore, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution in depriving the company of its property without due process of law and by depriving it of the equal protection of the laws. "In Beardsley v. N.Y., L.E. & W.R.R. Co. ( 162 N.Y. 230 ) the Court of Appeals felt constrained by the <targetCase>Smith</targetCase> case to declare the Mileage Book Law of this State invalid as to companies in existence at the time of its passage, but in Purdy v. Erie R.R. Co. ( 162 N.Y. 43 ) that law was held valid as to companies organized after the statute was passed. "In Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Kentucky ( 183 U.S. 503 ), after citing the <targetCase>Smith</targetCase> case and like cases, the court says (at p. 511): `Nor, yet, are we ready to carry the *14 doctrine of the cited cases beyond the limits therein established.' "In the Minnesota Rate Case ( Simpson v. Shepard, 230 U.S. 352 ) the legality of an order of the Commission of that State was recognized which fixed a maximum freight rate and passenger rate, the latter at two cents a mile as the maximum fare for passengers twelve years of age or over, and one cent a mile for those under twelve years of age. "In Interstate R. Co. v. Massachusetts ( 207 U.S. 79 ) the Massachusetts law prescribing special rates less than the maximum for school children was held valid. These cases indicate that the <targetCase>Smith</targetCase> case is not to be extended beyond the facts upon which it rests. "The <targetCase>Smith</targetCase> case distinguishes itself from this case where the court (at p. 693) says: `This act is not like one establishing certain hours in the day during which trains shall be run for a less charge than during the other hours. In such case it is the establishing of maximum rates of fare for the whole public during those hours, and it is not a discrimination in favor of certain persons by which they can obtain lower rates by purchasing a certain number of tickets by reason of which the company is compelled to carry them at the reduced rate, and thus, in substance, to part with its property at a less sum than it would be otherwise entitled to charge. The power to compel the company to carry persons under the circumstances as provided for in this act, for less than the usual rates, does not seem to be based upon any reason which has hitherto been regarded as sufficient to authorize an interference with the corporation, although a common carrier and a railroad.' "Our flourishing cities owe their position and prosperity, in part, to the commutation rates for suburban service; the health and welfare of the public are concerned that people doing business in the large cities may live in the *15 country where the surroundings are pleasanter, more healthy and to the advantage of themselves and their families. It is a known fact that such rates exist upon all railways entering large cities, and have usually been established by the companies voluntarily in the interest of themselves and the public. The service is different in its nature from the other passenger service. It is so universal, of such large proportion, has become so necessary to the public that it cannot be said that the fixing of reasonable and just rates for it is unusual or unreasonable, or the granting of a benefit to individuals and not for convenience to the public.
**Combined Opinion**
That decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of New York on the opinion of the Appellate Division. 215 N.Y. 689 . The subject was elaborately considered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the Commutation Rate Case, 21 I.C.C. 428 , in which the authority of the Commission to fix reasonable rates was sustained. In the course of the opinion, Commissioner Harlan, speaking for a unanimous Commission, said: "Another case strongly relied upon by the defendants is L.S. & M.S.R.R. Co. v. <targetCase>Smith</targetCase>, 173 U.S. 699 . It there appeared that the legislature of the state of Michigan had fixed the maximum passenger fare to be charged by railroad companies for local journeys within the state. By a subsequent enactment it required the carriers to sell 1,000-mile tickets for use within the lower peninsula at a price not exceeding $20 and in the upper peninsula at a price not exceeding $25. Various conditions affecting the *16 use of the tickets were also fixed by the act, and among others that they should be valid for two years after the date of purchase. It was held that in the exercise of its general police power a state may fix maximum fares, but that it may not fix a rate for 1,000-mile tickets that involves a discrimination in favor of those who buy them. The statute was held to be invalid. The case, however, involved mileage tickets which, we must repeat, differ very essentially in character from commutation tickets.
**Combined Opinion**
Although they *17 are mentioned together in section 22, the force and effect of that provision must necessarily differ with the differing character of the several kinds of tickets. It seems to be settled under that section that a carrier may enter upon the policy and practice of issuing mileage books and excursion tickets at less than its regular normal fare for the one-way journey, and, having adopted such a policy, may subsequently withdraw from it and refuse longer to issue such tickets. That has been the view of this Commission, and is the view generally entertained, although there may be exceptional circumstances where a different conclusion would be required. It by no means follows, however, that a carrier under section 22 may exercise the same scope and freedom of action with respect to commutation tickets." The reasoning of these decisions is sound and involves no violation of the Federal Constitution. True it is that it may not be possible to reconcile these views with all that is said in the opinion delivered for the majority of the court in the case of Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co. v. Smith, <targetCase>supra</targetCase> . The views therein expressed which are inconsistent with the right of the States to fix reasonable commutation fares when the carrier has itself established fares for such service, must be regarded as overruled by the decision in this case. We find no error in the decree of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, and the same is Affirmed. Dissenting: THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE McKENNA and MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS.
