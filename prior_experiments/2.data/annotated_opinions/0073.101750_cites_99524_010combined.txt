**Combined Opinion**
Cf. Atlantic Coast Line v. Standard Oil Co., 275 U.S. 257 , 269. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419 . Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U.S. 100 . It follows that the furnishing of gas to consumers in Ohio municipalities by means of distribution plants to supply the gas suitably for the service for which it is intended is not interstate commerce but a business of purely local concern exclusively within the jurisdiction of the State. Appellant relies on Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., <targetCase>252 U.S. 23</targetCase> . There the question was whether the New York commission had jurisdiction to prescribe the rates to be charged local consumers of gas transported to that State from Pennsylvania. This court, following the findings of the highest court of New York ( 225 N.Y. 397 , 403-404; 122 N.E. 260 ), held that the entire movement of the gas was interstate commerce and that, in the absence of contrary regulation by the Congress, the state commission had jurisdiction to prescribe such rates. The theory on which that conclusion was reached is not wholly consistent with the views expressed in Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, supra , and in Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., supra . In the former the court *472 said (p. 245): "Interstate movement [of natural gas being transported from State to State] ended when the gas passed into local mains."
