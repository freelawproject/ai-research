**Concurrence Opinion**
 For it has long been recognized as the very essence of our federalism that the States should have the widest latitude in the administration of their own systems of criminal justice.” 356 U. S., at 468 .  But in the present case Missouri did not have “the widest latitude” because Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969), decided after Hoag , held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee that no person shall “be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb” is enforceable against the States, and North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), accorded fully retroactive effect to that holding.  This means, under our decisions, that federal standards as to what constitutes the “same offence” apply alike to federal and state proceedings; it would be incongruous to have different standards determine the validity of a claim of double jeopardy depending on whether the claim was asserted in a state or federal court. Cf. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 11 (1964).  The Double Jeopardy Clause is a guarantee “that the State with all its resources and power [shall] not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity .  .  .  .” Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 187</citedDecision> (1957).  This guarantee is expressed as a prohibition against multiple prosecutions for the “same offence.” Although the phrase “same offence” appeared in most of the early common-law articulations of the double-jeop *451 ardy principle, 1 questions of its precise meaning rarely arose prior to the 18th century, and by the time the Bill of Rights was adopted it had not been authoritatively defined.  2 When the common law did finally attempt a definition, in The King v. Vandercomb, 2 Leach 708, 720, 168 Eng. Rep. 455, 461 (Crown 1796), it adopted the “same evidence” test, which provided little protection from multiple prosecution: “[U]nless the first indictment were such as the prisoner might have been convicted upon by proof of the facts contained in the second indictment, an acquittal on the first indictment can be no bar to the second.” The “same evidence” test of “same offence” was soon followed by a majority of American jurisdictions, but its deficiencies are obvious.  It does not enforce but virtually annuls the constitutional guarantee.  For example, where a single criminal episode involves several victims, under the “same evidence” test a separate prosecution may be brought as to each.  E. g., State v. Hoag, 21 N. J. 496, 122 A. 2d 628 (1956), aff’d, 356 U. S. 464 (1958).  The “same evidence” test permits multiple prosecutions where a single transaction is divisible into chronologically discrete crimes.
