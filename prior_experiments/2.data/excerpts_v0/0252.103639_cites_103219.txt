Passage 1:
ate subject of taxation. The power to tax "is an incident of sovereignty, and is coextensive with that to which it is an incident. All subjects over which the sovereign power of a State extends are objects of taxation." McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 429. Intangibles, which are legal relationships between persons and which in fact have no geographical location, are so associated with the owner that they and their transfer at death are taxable at the place of his domicile, where his person and the exercise of his property rights are subject to the control of the sovereign power. His transfer of interests in intangibles, by virtue of the exercise of a donated power instead of that derived from ownership, stands on the same footing. In both cases the sovereign's control over his person and estate at the place of his domicile, and his duty to contribute to the financial support of government there, afford adequate constitutional basis for the imposition of a tax. Curry v. McCanless, <targetCase>307 U.S. 357</targetCase>; cf. Graves v. Elliott, 307 U.S. 383.
*661 These were not novel propositions, when they were restated in the McCanless and Elliott cases,[1] and they were challenged then, though unsuccessfully, only on the ground that the transfer of the intangibles was subject to taxation in another state where they were held in trust. But the contention that the due process clause forecloses taxation of an interest in intangibles by the state of its owner when they are held in trust in another state was rejected in Bullen v. Wisconsin, 240 U.S. 625. In that case, a fund had been given in trust reserving to the donor a general power of revocation and the disposition of the trust income during life. This Court held that upon his death an inheritance tax could be levied by the state of his domicile although the trustee and the trust fund were outside the state.
In numerous other cases the jurisdiction to tax the use and enjoyment of interests in intangibles, regardless of the location of the paper evi
Passage 2:
ministration of justice rather than blind adherence to conflicting precedents, the Wachovia case must be overruled. There is no reason why the state should continue to be deprived of revenue from a subject which from the beginning has been within the reach of its taxing power; a subject over which we cannot say the state's control has been curtailed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. No interest which could be served by so rigid an adherence to stare decisis is superior to the demands of a system of justice based on a considered and a consistent application of the Constitution. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406, footnote 1; and cf. Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376, 387. The Wachovia case should be and now is overruled and the constitutional power of New York to levy the present tax is sustained.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS concurs in the result only because he considers himself bound by the decisions in Curry v. McCanless, <targetCase>307 U.S. 357</targetCase>, and Graves v. Elliott, 307 U.S. 383. Otherwise he would vote to affirm.
