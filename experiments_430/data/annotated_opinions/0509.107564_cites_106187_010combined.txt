 [13] But "[t]he premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited." Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 304 .  Thus, although a closely divided Court supposed in Olmstead that surveillance without any trespass and without the seizure of any material object fell outside the ambit of the Constitution, we have since departed from the narrow view on which that decision rested.  Indeed, we have expressly held that the Fourth Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements, over-heard without any "technical trespass under .  .  .  local property law." Silverman v. United States, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 505, 511</citedDecision> .  Once this much is acknowledged, and once it is recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects people and not simply "areas"against unreasonable searches and seizures, it becomes clear that the reach of that Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure.  We conclude that the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the "trespass" doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling.  The Government's activities in electronically listening to and recording the petitioner's words violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied while using the telephone booth and thus constituted a "search and seizure" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  The fact that the electronic device employed to achieve that end did not happen to penetrate the wall of the booth can have no constitutional significance.  *354 The question remaining for decision, then, is whether the search and seizure conducted in this case complied with constitutional standards.  In that regard, the Government's position is that its agents acted in an entirely defensible manner: They did not begin their electronic surveillance until investigation of the petitioner's activities had established a strong probability that he was using the telephone in question to transmit gambling information to persons in other States, in violation of federal law. Moreover, the surveillance was limited, both in scope and in duration, to the specific purpose of establishing the contents of the petitioner's unlawful telephonic communications.

 On the other hand, conversations in the open would not be protected against being overheard, for the expectation of privacy under the circumstances would be unreasonable.  Cf. Hester v. United States, supra .  The critical fact in this case is that "[o]ne who occupies it, [a telephone booth] shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume" that his conversation is not being intercepted.  Ante, at 352.  The point is not that the booth is "accessible to the public" at other times, ante, at 351, but that it is a temporarily private place whose momentary occupants' expectations of freedom from intrusion are recognized as reasonable.  Cf. Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253 .  In Silverman v. United States, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 505</citedDecision> , we held that eavesdropping accomplished by means of an electronic device that penetrated the premises occupied by petitioner was a violation of the Fourth Amendment.  *362 That case established that interception of conversations reasonably intended to be private could constitute a "search and seizure," and that the examination or taking of physical property was not required.  This view of the Fourth Amendment was followed in Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471, at 485 , and Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, at 51 .  Also compare Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323, at 327 .  In <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> we found it unnecessary to re-examine Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129 , which had held that electronic surveillance accomplished without the physical penetration of petitioner's premises by a tangible object did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  This case requires us to reconsider Goldman , and I agree that it should now be overruled.  [*] Its limitation on Fourth Amendment protection is, in the present day, bad physics as well as bad law, for reasonable expectations of privacy may be defeated by electronic as well as physical invasion.  Finally, I do not read the Court's opinion to declare that no interception of a conversation one-half of which occurs in a public telephone booth can be reasonable in the absence of a warrant.  As elsewhere under the Fourth Amendment, warrants are the general rule, to which the legitimate needs of law enforcement may demand specific exceptions.  It will be time enough to consider any such exceptions when an appropriate occasion presents itself, and I agree with the Court that this is not one.  MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring.

 As I made clear in my dissenting opinion in Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, 76 , I continue to believe that this exclusionary rule formulated in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 , rests on the "supervisory power" of this Court over other federal courts and is not rooted in the Fourth Amendment.  See Wolf v. Colorado, concurring opinion, 338 U. S. 25, 39 , at 40.  See also Mapp v. Ohio, concurring opinion, 367 U. S. 643, 661-666 .  This rule has caused the Court to refuse to accept evidence where there has been such an intrusion regardless of whether there has been a search or seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  As this Court said in Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 438-439 , "The Court has in the past sustained instances of `electronic eavesdropping' against constitutional challenge, when devices have been used to enable government agents to overhear conversations which would have been beyond the reach of the human ear [citing *370 Olmstead and Goldman ].  It has been insisted only that the electronic device not be planted by an unlawful physical invasion of a constitutionally protected area.  <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> v. United States .  " To support its new interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, which in effect amounts to a rewriting of the language, the Court's opinion concludes that "the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been .  .  .  eroded by our subsequent decisions .  .  .  ." But the only cases cited as accomplishing this "eroding" are Silverman v. United States, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 505</citedDecision> , and Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 .  Neither of these cases "eroded" Olmstead or Goldman.  Silverman is an interesting choice since there the Court expressly refused to re-examine the rationale of Olmstead or Goldman although such a re-examination was strenuously urged upon the Court by the petitioners' counsel.  Also it is significant that in <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> , as the Court described it, "the eavesdropping was accomplished by means of an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied by the petitioners," <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 509</citedDecision> , thus calling into play the supervisory exclusionary rule of evidence.  As I have pointed out above, where there is an unauthorized intrusion, this Court has rejected admission of evidence obtained regardless of whether there has been an unconstitutional search and seizure.  The majority's decision here relies heavily on the statement in the opinion that the Court "need not pause to consider whether or not there was a technical trespass under the local property law relating to party walls." (At 511.) Yet this statement should not becloud the fact that time and again the opinion emphasizes that there has been an unauthorized intrusion: "For a fair reading of the record in this case shows that the eavesdropping was accomplished by means of an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied by the petitioners." (At 509, emphasis added.) "Eavesdropping *371 accomplished by means of such a physical intrusion is beyond the pale of even those decisions .
**Combined Opinion**
 ." (At 512, emphasis added.) "We find no occasion to re-examine Goldman here, but we decline to go beyond it, by even a fraction of an inch.  " (At 512, emphasis added.) As if this were not enough, Justices Clark and Whittaker concurred with the following statement: "In view of the determination by the majority that the unauthorized physical penetration into petitioners' premises constituted sufficient trespass to remove this case from the coverage of earlier decisions, we feel obliged to join in the Court's opinion." (At 513, emphasis added.) As I made clear in my dissent in Berger , the Court in <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> held the evidence should be excluded by virtue of the exclusionary rule and "I would not have agreed with the Court's opinion in <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> .  .  .  had I thought that the result depended on finding a violation of the Fourth Amendment .  .  .  ." 388 U. S., at 79-80 .  In light of this and the fact that the Court expressly refused to re-examine Olmstead and Goldman , I cannot read <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> as overturning the interpretation stated very plainly in Olmstead and followed in Goldman that eavesdropping is not covered by the Fourth Amendment.  The other "eroding" case cited in the Court's opinion is Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 .  It appears that this case is cited for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment applies to "intangibles," such as conversation, and the following ambiguous statement is quoted from the opinion: "The premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited." 387 U. S., at 304 .  But far from being concerned *372 with eavesdropping, Warden v. Hayden upholds the seizure of clothes, certainly tangibles by any definition.  The discussion of property interests was involved only with the common-law rule that the right to seize property depended upon proof of a superior property interest.  Thus, I think that although the Court attempts to convey the impression that for some reason today Olmstead and Goldman are no longer good law, it must face up to the fact that these cases have never been overruled or even "eroded."

 Cf. Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U. S. 622 ; Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77 .  [8]  In support of their respective claims, the parties have compiled competing lists of "protected areas" for our consideration.  It appears to be common ground that a private home is such an area, Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 , but that an open field is not.  Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 .  Defending the inclusion of a telephone booth in his list the petitioner cites United States v. Stone, 232 F. Supp. 396 , and United States v. Madison, 32 L. W. 2243 (D. C. Ct. Gen. Sess.).  Urging that the telephone booth should be excluded, the Government finds support in United States v. Borgese, 235 F. Supp. 286 .  [9]  It is true that this Court has occasionally described its conclusions in terms of "constitutionally protected areas," see, e. g., Silverman v. United States, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 505, 510, 512</citedDecision> ; Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 438-439 ; Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, 57, 59 , but we have never suggested that this concept can serve as a talismanic solution to every Fourth Amendment problem.  [10] Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385 .  [11] Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257 .  [12] Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253 .  [13]  See Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 464-466 .  We do not deal in this case with the law of detention or arrest under the Fourth Amendment.  [14]  Based upon their previous visual observations of the petitioner, the agents correctly predicted that he would use the telephone booth for several minutes at approximately the same time each morning.

 [20]  In Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20, 30 , the Court stated: "The right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by which it was committed, as well as weapons and other things to effect an escape from custody, is not to be doubted." Whatever one's view of "the long-standing practice of searching for other proofs of guilt within the control of the accused found upon arrest," United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56, 61 ; cf. id., at 71-79 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter), the concept of an "incidental" search cannot readily be extended to include surreptitious surveillance of an individual either immediately before, or immediately after, his arrest.  [21]  Although "[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others," Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298-299 , there seems little likelihood that electronic surveillance would be a realistic possibility in a situation so fraught with urgency.  [22]  A search to which an individual consents meets Fourth Amendment requirements, Zap v. United States, 328 U. S. 624 , but of course "the usefulness of electronic surveillance depends on lack of notice to the suspect." Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 463 (dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN).  [23]  Whether safeguards other than prior authorization by a magistrate would satisfy the Fourth Amendment in a situation involving the national security is a question not presented by this case. [24]  See Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323, 330 .  [*]  I also think that the course of development evinced by <citedDecision>Silverman, supra,</citedDecision> Wong Sun, supra, Berger, supra, and today's decision must be recognized as overruling Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 , which essentially rested on the ground that conversations were not subject to the protection of the Fourth Amendment.  [*]  In previous cases, which are undisturbed by today's decision, the Court has upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, admission at trial of evidence obtained (1) by an undercover police agent to whom a defendant speaks without knowledge that he is in the employ of the police, Hoffa v. United States, 385 U. S. 293 (1966); (2) by a recording device hidden on the person of such an informant, Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427 (1963); Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323 (1966); and (3) by a policeman listening to the secret micro-wave transmissions of an agent conversing with the defendant in another location, On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747 (1952).  When one man speaks to another he takes all the risks ordinarily inherent in so doing, including the risk that the man to whom he speaks will make public what he has heard.  The Fourth Amendment does not protect against unreliable (or law-abiding) associates.  Hoffa v. United States, supra .  It is but a logical and reasonable extension of this principle that a man take the risk that his hearer, free to memorize what he hears for later verbatim repetitions, is instead recording it or transmitting it to another.  The present case deals with an entirely different situation, for as the Court emphasizes the petitioner "sought to exclude .  .  .  the uninvited ear," and spoke under circumstances in which a reasonable person would assume that uninvited ears were not listening.  [*]  The first paragraph of my Brother HARLAN'S concurring opinion is susceptible of the interpretation, although probably not intended, that this Court "has long held" eavesdropping to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment and therefore "presumptively unreasonable in the absence of a search warrant." There is no reference to any long line of cases, but simply a citation to <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> , and several cases following it, to establish this historical proposition.  In the first place, as I have indicated in this opinion, I do not read <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> as holding any such thing; and in the second place, <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> was decided in 1961.  Thus, whatever it held, it cannot be said it "has [been] long held." I think my Brother HARLAN recognizes this later in his opinion when he admits that the Court must now overrule Olmstead and Goldman .  In having to overrule these cases in order to establish the holding the Court adopts today, it becomes clear that the Court is promulgating new doctrine instead of merely following what it "has long held." This is emphasized by my Brother HARLAN'S claim that it is "bad physics" to adhere to Goldman .  Such an assertion simply illustrates the propensity of some members of the Court to rely on their limited understanding of modern scientific subjects in order to fit the Constitution to the times and give its language a meaning that it will not tolerate.
