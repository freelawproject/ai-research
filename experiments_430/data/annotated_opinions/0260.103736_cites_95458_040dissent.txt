*308 Mr. Justice Murphy: I dissent because the Court today introduces an undesirable rigidity in the application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to a problem which is of acute interest to all the states of the Union and on which they hold varying and sharply divergent views, the problem of how they shall treat the marriage relation.  This case cannot be considered as one involving the Constitution alone; rather the case involves the interaction of public policy upon the Constitution.  This is not to say that our function is to become censors of public morals and decide this case in accordance with what we may think is the wisest rule for society with respect to divorce.  But the question of public policy enters to this degree — marriage and the family have generally been regarded as basic components of our national life, and the solution of the problems engendered by the marital relation, the formulation of standards of public morality in connection therewith, and the supervision of domestic (in the sense of family) affairs, have been left to the individual states.' Each state has the deepest concern for its citizens in those matters, and, concomitantly with that concern, it exercises the widest control over marriage, determining how it is to be solemnized, the attendant obligations, and how it may be dissolved.  When a conflict arises between the divergent policies of two states in this area of legitimate governmental concern, as here, this Court should give appropriate consideration to the interests of each state.  In recognition of the paramount interest of the state of domicile over the marital status of its citizens, this Court has held that actual good faith domicile of at least one party is essential to confer authority and jurisdiction on the courts of a state to render a decree of divorce that will be entitled to extraterritorial effect under the *309 Full Faith and Credit Clause, Bell v. Bell, <citedDecision>181 U. S. 175</citedDecision> , even though both parties personally appear, Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U. S. 14 .  When the doctrine of those cases is applied to the facts of this one, the question becomes a simple one: Did petitioners acquire a bona fide domicile in Nevada?  I agree with my brother Jackson that the only proper answer on the record is, no. North Carolina is the state in which petitioners have their roots, the state to which they immediately returned after a brief absence just sufficient to achieve their purpose under Nevada’s requirements.  It follows that the Nevada decrees are entitled to no extraterritorial effect when challenged in another state.  <citedDecision>Bell</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bell, supra;</citedDecision> Andrews v. Andrews, supra. This is not to say that the Nevada decrees are without any legal effect in the State of Nevada.  That question is not before us.  It may be that for the purposes of that state the petitioners have been released from their marital vows, consistently with the procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, on the basis of compliance with its residential requirements and constructive service of process on the non-resident spouses.  But conceding the validity in Nevada of its decrees dissolving the marriages, it does not mechanically follow that the Full Faith and Credit Clause compels North Carolina to accept them.  We have recognized an area of flexibility in the application of the Clause to preserve and protect state policies in matters of vital public concern.  We have said that conflicts between such state policies should be resolved, “not by giving automatic effect to the full faith and credit clause, .  .

 A spouse who appears and contests the jurisdiction of the court of another state to grant a divorce may not collaterally attack its findings of domicile- and jurisdiction made after such appearance.  Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32 .  So also, a deserter from the matrimonial domicile may be bound by a divorce granted by a court of the state where the matrimonial domicile is situated.  Whether fault on the part of the deserter is an essential seems on the basis of our cases on -jurisdiction *320 for divorce to be an open question; Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S. 155 ; Haddock v. Haddock, supra, at 570, 572, 583 ; and Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551 ; but our decisions on analogous problems might be found to afford adequate support for a decision that it is not.  Cf. Washington ex rel. Bond & Goodwin & Tucker v. Superior Court, 289 U. S. 361 ; Doherty & Co. v. Goodman, 294 U. S. 623 .  See, further, Eestatement, Conflict of Laws, §§ 112, 113.  This was the decision in Bell v. Bell, <citedDecision>181 U. S. 175</citedDecision> ; and Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U. S. 14 .  Davis v. Davis, supra, note 6 , in no way indicates that a finding of domicile after appearance of the absent spouse and litigation of the question would be conclusive upon the state of his domicile in litigation involving its interests and not merely those of the parties.  Cf. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 172, n. 13 .  1 Beale, Conflict of Laws (1935) § 10.3.  Compare Texas v. Florida, 306 U. S. 398 , with Massachusetts v. Missouri, 308 U. S. 1 .  And see Tweed and Sargent, Death and Taxation are Certain — But What of Domicile?, 53 Harvard Law Review 68, 76; ‘‘Texas v. Florida does not help the situation in the ordinary-case because at the rates of tax prevailing in most of the states a controversy between the states of which the Supreme Court has jurisdiction can arise only if at least four states claim a tax and the estate consists of intangible property having a value of at least $30,000,000.  On no other state of facts will the assets be insufficient to meet the plaims of all of the claimant states.”
