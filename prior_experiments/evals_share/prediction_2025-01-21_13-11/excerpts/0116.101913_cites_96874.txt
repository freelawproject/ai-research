Case of interest: Globe Newspaper Co. v. Walker (1908)
-----------------------
 297; United States Glue Co., v. Oak Creek, 247 U.S. 321, 328, 329; New Jersey Bell Telephone Co., v. State Board, 280 U.S. 338, 346. The question is thus presented whether copyrights are to be *127 deemed instrumentalities of the Federal Government and hence immune from state taxation.
The Constitution empowers the Congress "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries." Art. I, ยง 8, par. 8. The production to which the protection of copyright may be accorded is the property of the author and not of the United States. But the copyright is the creature of the Federal Statute passed in the exercise of the power vested in the Congress. As this Court has repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one. Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, 661; American Tobacco Co., v. Werckmeister, 207 U.S. 284, 291; Globe Newspaper Co., v. Walker, <caseOfInterest>210 U.S. 356</caseOfInterest>, 362; Caliga v. Inter Ocean Newspaper Co., 215 U.S. 182, 188. The Statute confers upon the author after publication the exclusive right for a limited period to multiply and vend copies and to engage in the other activities described by the statute in relation to the subject matter. U.S.C., Tit. 17. In creating this right, the Congress did not reserve to the United States any interest in the production itself, or in the copyright, or in the profits that may be derived from its use. Nor did the Congress provide that the right, or the gains from its exercise, should be free of tax. The owner of the copyright, if he pleases, may refrain from vending or licensing and content himself with simply exercising the right to exclude others from using his property. Compare Continental Paper Bag Co., v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., 210 U.S. 405, 422, 424. The sole interest of the United States and the primary object in conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits derived by the public from the lab
