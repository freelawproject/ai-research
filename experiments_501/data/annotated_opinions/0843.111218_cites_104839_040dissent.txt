 But the relief need not, and under these facts should not, be so restricted [to divestiture].  The fact that the companies were affiliated induced joint action and agreement.  Common control was one of the instruments in bringing about unity of purpose and unity of action and in making the conspiracy effective.  If that affiliation continues, *781 there will be tempting opportunity for these exhibitors to continue to act in combination against the independents.” 323 U. S., at 189-190 (emphasis supplied).  Similarly, in Schine Chain Theatres, Inc. v. United States, 334 U. S. 110 (1948), the Court held that concerted action by parents and subsidiaries constituted an unlawful conspiracy.  3 That was also the holding in United States v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100, 109 (1948).  The majority’s observation that in these cases there were alternative grounds that could have been used to reach the same result, ante, at 763, n. 8, disguises neither the fact that the holding that actually appears in these opinions rests on conspiracy between affiliated entities, nor that today’s holding is inconsistent with what was actually held in these cases. In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., <citedDecision>340 U. S. 211</citedDecision> (1951), the Court’s holding was plain and unequivocal: *782 This holding is so clear that even the Court, which is not wanting for inventiveness in its reading of the prior cases, cannot explain it away.  The Court suggests only that today Kiefer-Stewart might be decided on alternative grounds, ante, at 764, ignoring the fact that today’s holding is inconsistent with the ground on which the case actually was decided.  4 *781 “Respondents next suggest that their status as ‘mere in-strumentalities of a single manufacturing-merchandizing unit’ makes it impossible for them to have conspired in a manner forbidden by the Sherman Act.  But this suggestion runs counter to our past decisions that common ownership and control does not liberate corporations from the impact of the antitrust laws.  E. g. United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218 .  The rule is especially applicable where, as here, respondents hold themselves out as competitors.” Id., at 215.  *782 A construction of the statute that reaches agreements between corporate parents and subsidiaries was again embraced by the Court in Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 598 (1951), 5 and Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U. S. 134 (1968).

 Also pertinent is United, States v. Citizens & Southern National Bank, 422 U. S. 86 (1975), in which the Court wrote: “The central message of the Sherman Act is that a business entity must find new customers and higher profits through internal expansion — that is, by competing successfully rather than by arranging treaties with its competitors.  This Court has held that even commonly owned firms must compete against each other, if they hold themselves out as distinct entities.  ‘The corporate interrelationships of the conspirators .  .  .  are not determinative of the applicability of the Sherman Act.’ United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218, 227 .  See also Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., <citedDecision>340 U. S. 211, 215</citedDecision> ; Timken Roller Bearing Co. v.

 Excessive advertising in the cereal, drug, or detergent industries, annual style changes in the auto industry, and other such practices could be reached as soon as they threatened to inhibit competition; there would be no need to wait until a ‘dangerous probability’ of monopoly had been reached, the requirement under Section 2 ‘attempt’ doctrine.  Nor would a single firm restraint of trade rule be overbroad.  It would in no way threaten single firm activity — setting a price, deciding what market it would deal in, or the like — which did not threaten competitive conditions.” L. Sullivan, swpra n. 9, § 114, at 324 (footnotes omitted).  This was the case in Kiefer-Stewart, for example.  Seagram had refused to sell liquor to Kiefer-Stewart unless it agreed to an illegal resale price maintenance scheme.  Kiefer-Stewart refused to agree, and as a result was injured by losing access to Seagram’s products.  See <citedDecision>340 U. S., at 213</citedDecision> .  See United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 588-593 (1981) (discussing congressional findings underlying the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970).  Section 1 of the Sherman Act has on occasion been used against *792 various types of racketeering activity.  See Hartwell, Criminal RICO and Antitrust, 52 Antitrust L. J. 311, 312-313 (1983); McLaren, Antitrust and Competition — Review of the Past Year and Suggestions for the Future, in New York State Bar Assn., 1971 Antitrust Law Symposium 1, 3 (1971).

Professor Sullivan elaborates: “Picture, at one end of the spectrum, a family business which operates one retail store in each of three or four adjacent communities.  All of the stores are managed as a unit by one individual, the founder of the business who sets policy, does all the buying, decides on all the advertising, sets prices, and hires and fires all employees other than family members.
