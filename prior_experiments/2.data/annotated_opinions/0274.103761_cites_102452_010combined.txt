**Combined Opinion**
In that case the Fleet Corporation was held to be amenable to suit. And that policy has been followed. For when it comes to the utilization of corporate facilities [2] in the broadening phases of federal activities in the commercial or business field, immunity from suit is not favored. Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., 306 U.S. 381 ; Federal Housing Administration v. Burr, 309 U.S. 242 . Congress adopted that policy when it made corporations wholly owned by the United States suable on maritime causes of action under ยง 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act. That it had the power to grant or withhold immunity from suit on behalf of governmental corporations is plain. Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, <targetCase>295 U.S. 229</targetCase> ; Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Menihan Corp., 312 U.S. 81 . We may also assume that it would have the power to grant immunity to private operators of government vessels for their torts. But such a basic change in one of the fundamentals *581 of the law of agency should hardly be left to conjecture. The withdrawal of the right to sue the agent for his torts would result at times in a substantial dilution of the rights of claimants. Assuming that the ordinary rules of agency apply in determining whether the United States or the Maritime Commission is responsible under ยง 2 of the Act for torts of private operators such as respondent, there would be instances where unless the private operator was liable no one would be. The principal is not liable for every negligent act of his agent. Furthermore, if all suits to enforce maritime causes of action must be brought in such cases under ยง 2 of the Act the short statute of limitations of two years contained in ยง 5 is applicable.
