The key reasoning is:
1. The passage discusses the Crain v. United States case and its previous ruling about the necessity of a plea being entered of record.
2. The text suggests that technical objections are now viewed more leniently than in the past.
3. However, there is no direct statement that the Crain case is overruled.
4. The language suggests a shift in interpretation rather than a complete overruling of the previous case.

Therefore, based strictly on the provided passage, the Target Case has not been overruled, though its strict interpretation may have been softened."

1. The Target Case is `224 U.S. 1` (Henry v. Dick Co.)

2. In Passage 2, the majority opinion explicitly states: ""It is obvious that the conclusions arrived at in this opinion are such that the decision in Henry v. Dick Co., 224 U.S. 1, must be regarded as overruled.""

3. Passage 3 contains a dissenting opinion, which does not constitute the official court ruling.

4. The majority opinion clearly and explicitly overrules the Target Case.

The passage discusses several railroad rate cases and seems to be exploring the nuanced application of rate regulations. Specifically for the Target Case (Minnesota Rate Case), the passage appears to be describing it neutrally, noting that the legality of a state commission's order fixing maximum freight and passenger rates was recognized.

There are no explicit statements overruling the Target Case. The language suggests the case is being cited as a precedent that helps illustrate the evolving understanding of rate regulation.

}
```

The key reasoning is that while the passage discusses the Target Case, it simply distinguishes its applicability to the current situation without actually overruling the case.

The key points supporting this conclusion are:

- The Target Case is simply referenced in a list of citations
- The passage's focus is on other legal principles and a different case being overruled"

The key evidence is in this sentence: ""As the tax is measured by gross receipts, the case is not ruled by Educational Films Corp. v.

The Target Case is `307 Pa. 203`, which appears in both passages. I'll determine if this case has been overruled.

Key observations:
1. The passages discuss the Target Case in the context of legal duty owed by a railroad.
2. The passages reference the Target Case multiple times, but do not explicitly state it is overruled.
3. The Supreme Court is critiquing the Circuit Court of Appeals' approach of treating this as a ""general law"" question instead of respecting state law interpretation.
4. The Supreme Court reverses the lower court's judgment and remands the case, indicating a procedural correction rather than an overruling of the Target Case itself.

Therefore:

The rationale is based on the context in Passage 2, which suggests that the Target Case stands alone against multiple other court decisions, indicating it has been implicitly overruled by the prevailing legal interpretation at the time."

The Target Case is `<targetCase>296 U.S. 48</targetCase>`, which appears to be Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co.

Looking at the passage, I see:
1. The majority opinion seems to be rejecting previous distinctions in legal interpretation
2. A dissenting opinion by Justice Roberts discusses the case
3. There's no explicit statement that the Target Case is being overruled

Critically, the passage does not contain a clear, explicit overruling of the Target Case. While the majority opinion criticizes previous interpretations, it does not definitively state that the Target Case itself is overruled.

The rationale is based on the following observations:
1. The Target Case is mentioned in Passage 1 alongside other cases that have sustained the constitutional validity of agricultural commodity regulations.
2. The case is referenced again in a footnote in Passage 2, again without any suggestion of being overruled.
3. The passages use the case as a supportive reference for discussing agricultural policy and legal approaches.

4. The discussion appears to be an elaboration and continued application of the principles established in Sinclair, not a rejection of those principles."

The passages critique a specific historical statement in the case, but do not overturn the case's substantive legal holding.","Based on the passages provided, I will analyze whether the Target Case (Toledo Newspaper Co. v.

Key observations:
1. In Passage 1, the Court notes an ""inaccuracy"" in the historical observation from the Toledo case, but this does not mean the case itself is overruled.
2. In Passage 2, the Toledo case is cited alongside other cases as part of a consistent judicial interpretation, suggesting it remains good law.
3. The critique appears to be about a historical commentary, not the legal reasoning or holding of the case.
4. There are no explicit statements overruling the Toledo case in either passage."

Key observations:
1. In Passage 1, Savin is mentioned as part of a historical legal interpretation.
2. In Passage 2, Savin is explicitly cited as a precedent that supports the court's current understanding of contempt.

The key points supporting this conclusion are:
1. In Passage 2, the Target Case is mentioned as part of a series of cases that have consistently interpreted the statute in a particular way.
2. The phrase ""This Court has hitherto, without a dissenting voice, regarded..."" suggests the Target Case remains valid precedent.
3. There are no explicit statements overruling or reversing the Target Case.

Key points supporting this conclusion:
1. The passage directly states that Ribnik v. McBride is no longer a controlling authority.
2. The Court highlights a progression of cases that have moved away from the original Ribnik ruling.

1. The Target Case is `<targetCase>278 U.S. 235</targetCase>` (Williams v. Standard Oil Co.)

2. The passage discusses this case in the context of price-fixing decisions, noting it as one of the few cases that limited state price-fixing powers.

3. However, the passage does NOT explicitly overrule this case. It merely mentions the case as part of a historical discussion of price-fixing jurisprudence.

4. Simply discussing or citing a case does not constitute overruling.

The key points supporting this conclusion are:

The key observations supporting this conclusion are:
1. The passages cite Dietzsch v. Huidekoper multiple times without suggesting it is no longer valid.

Key observations supporting this conclusion:
1. The case is cited multiple times across different passages as a supporting precedent
2. The passages discuss the case's principles in detail, indicating it remains authoritative
3. There are no explicit statements suggesting the case has been overruled

Key observations:
1. Passage 2 provides detailed analysis of the Target Case, noting it did not involve a decree and was not persuasive on relitigation issues.

The key evidence for overruling comes from Passage 3, specifically the paragraph that states the ""first come, first served"" rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr ""was discarded in Kline v.

Key observations:

3. In Passage 3, the case is again cited as a supporting precedent for the court's interpretation of Congressional power.

3. In Passage 2, Justice Roberts mentions the Target Case, but only notes that he considers himself ""bound by the decisions"" in this case. This is not an overruling.

4. There are no explicit statements in either passage that directly overrule the Target Case.

Therefore, my response is:

```json
{
  ""overruled"": ""no"",
  ""confidence"": 0.95,
  ""rationale"": ""Neither passage contains an explicit or implicit overruling of the Target Case. The case is referenced and appears to be treated as valid precedent, with Justice Roberts even stating he is 'bound' by its decision.""
}
```

Key points supporting this conclusion:
- The Target Case is cited positively in Passage 1
- Justice Roberts in Passage 2 indicates he considers the case binding
- No direct language of overruling is used regarding the Target Case"

}
```

The reasoning is as follows:
1. The Target Case is mentioned in both Passage 1 and the Notes section, but only as a citation to support legal arguments about taxation.
2. There are no explicit statements indicating that Saltonstall v. Saltonstall has been overruled.
3. The passages are discussing broader principles of state taxation and domicile, and the Target Case is used as a supporting reference.
4. The lack of a direct overruling statement means the case remains valid.

The key evidence for overruling includes:
1. Passage 4 describes the Haddock decision as making an ""arbitrary break with the past""
2. Passage 5 notes the decision was ""much criticized"" and is now being fundamentally reconsidered
3. Multiple passages analyze and critique the legal reasoning of the original Haddock case

Key observations:
1. Passage 3 provides a detailed critique of the Christmas v. Russell case, highlighting how its original context (a promissory note case with clear personal jurisdiction) differs from more complex modern scenarios.
2. The passage suggests the case's rule might be overly broad when applied to more nuanced situations, particularly in divorce and jurisdictional disputes.
3. However, criticism or reinterpretation does not constitute overruling. The passages do not contain an explicit statement that Christmas v. Russell is overruled.
4. The text actually continues to cite the case as a significant precedent, indicating it has not been fully overturned."

1. The Target Case is `<targetCase>250 U.S. 246</targetCase>` (The Lake Monroe)

2. Looking for Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions:
- The passage discusses The Lake Monroe case in the context of explaining the Suits in Admiralty Act
- The passage suggests the Act was designed to address certain holdings, including The Lake Monroe case
- However, the passage does not explicitly state that The Lake Monroe case is overruled

3. Key observations:
- The passage references The Lake Monroe case as part of historical context
- The text suggests the Act modified certain legal remedies
- But there is no direct statement overruling The Lake Monroe case

The Target Case is `Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233`.

In both passages, this case is referenced, but neither passage explicitly overrules it. In fact, both passages cite the case with apparent respect, discussing its principles and reasoning.

Passage 1 references the case as part of a broader discussion about taxation, noting ""See Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233, 250.""

Passage 2 also references the case, quoting its language about preserving ""an untrammeled press"" and discussing its reasoning about a specific type of tax.

These references do not constitute overruling. They are citations that appear to affirm the case's principles.

Therefore, my response is:

}
```

Key points supporting this conclusion:
1. Passage 3 contains an explicit statement overruling the Gobitis case.
2. The majority opinion clearly states the overruling, despite some Justices (Roberts and Reed) dissenting.
3. The Court provides detailed reasoning for why the previous decision was incorrect, demonstrating a clear intent to overturn the prior ruling."

Key evidence supporting this conclusion:

2. The passages discuss distinguishing the Hamilton case based on the voluntary nature of college attendance, not overruling it.

3. Passage 2's dissenting opinion directly states the majority is ""nullifying"" the previous decision

Key points supporting this conclusion:
1. The first passage indicates the court granted certiorari to re-examine previous cases, including Schwimmer.
2. Passage 3 provides context about changing interpretations of citizenship for conscientious objectors.
3. The majority opinion seems to have adopted a more lenient approach to conscientious objectors seeking citizenship, which directly contradicts the original Schwimmer ruling.

The key evidence for overruling comes from Passage 1, which directly states that cases like the Target Case are now ""obsolete"" due to changes in understanding diversity jurisdiction, particularly after the Erie Railroad v.

2. The citations appear to be using the case as a supporting legal precedent
3. There are no statements suggesting the case is being reversed or overruled
4. The context is a discussion of legal principles related to res judicata

</output>

My reasoning:
1. The Target Case (Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U.S. 111) is mentioned in both passages.
2. In Passage 1, the case is referenced as part of a legal discussion about agency principles, but not overruled.
3. In Passage 2, the case is mentioned in a footnote listing other cases.
4. There are no explicit statements saying this specific case is being overruled.
5. The confidence is slightly lower (0.6) because the context suggests legal nuance, but there's no clear overruling language.

The key is that while another case (Hust) is explicitly overruled in Passage 1, the Target Case itself is not directly addressed for overruling."

The Target Case is `<targetCase>330 U.S. 446</targetCase>`, which appears in both passages.

In Passage 1, the case is mentioned in a comparative context: ""Compare... American Stevedores v. Porello, <targetCase>330 U.S. 446</targetCase>"". This is a neutral citation and does not constitute overruling.

In Passage 2, the case is again mentioned neutrally: ""see... American Stevedores v. Porello, <targetCase>330 U.S. 446</targetCase>, 450-54"". This is also not an overruling.

Neither passage contains an explicit or implicit negative action that would overrule the Target Case.

The key evidence for this conclusion comes from the passage's discussion of how the Court's previous constitutional doctrine (represented by cases like the Target Case) was being systematically dismantled.

The key evidence for overruling comes from several parts of the text:

1. In the opening passage, the court directly states they are considering whether previous decisions, including the Target Case, ""have been so undermined by later decisions... that they should now be overruled.""

2. Passage 4 describes the Barnsdall Refineries case as the ""last sustained"" immunity decision, implying it has since been superseded.

3. The overall tone and analysis suggest the court is preparing to overturn the previous precedent set by cases like Barnsdall Refineries.

Key observations supporting this conclusion:
1. Passage 3 suggests that Mountain Producers Corp. was part of a broader judicial trend of reducing tax immunities.
2. Passage 4 describes Mountain Producers Corp. as a case that sought to reexamine previous legal foundations, but does not suggest it was itself overruled.
3. The passages treat Mountain Producers Corp. as a significant precedent being used to analyze tax immunity issues, not as a case being invalidated.

The rationale is based on several key points from Passage 3:
1. The court critically examines the reasoning in the Target Case (236 U.S. 230)
2. It challenges the previous court's approach to defining censorship terms
3. The language suggests the previous standard is no longer considered valid

The key evidence comes from Passage 3, where Justice Clark describes the Court's action of overruling its previous majority opinions.

Key observations supporting this conclusion:

Key reasoning:

4. The court's detailed explanation of why Madsen does not apply indicates an implicit overruling of the previous decision.

   - Dissenting opinions (if any) are not considered the court's ruling

Therefore, my response is:

```json
{
  ""overruled"": ""no"",
  ""confidence"": 0.95,

}
```

The reasoning is based on:
1. The Target Case is referenced in the passage multiple times (in footnotes [8] and [10])
2. There are no explicit statements saying the case is overruled
3. The context suggests the case is being cited as part of a legal discussion, but not being negated or overturned
4. Without a clear statement of overruling, the default interpretation is that the case remains valid

The confidence is set to 0.7 to reflect some uncertainty, as the passage does not provide a definitive statement about the case's status."

Key observations:

3. In Passage 3, the dissenting opinion cites Gideon as part of a list of constitutional guarantees.

The key points supporting this conclusion are:
1. The Target Case is cited in both passages as a reference point for legal reasoning.
2. There are no explicit statements saying the case is overruled.
3. The passages are using the case to discuss the legal context of the defendant's interrogation and rights.

Key reasoning:
1. The passages repeatedly reference the Massiah case (377 U.S. 201) as a significant precedent.
2. Passage 5 specifically states that Massiah weakened previous authorities, suggesting the case remains valid.
3. While there are dissenting opinions critiquing the application of the Massiah principle, these do not constitute an official overruling of the case.

}
```

The key evidence for overruling comes from two main sources:
1. Passage 3's footnote [15] directly states that the case's authority was weakened by subsequent Supreme Court decisions.
2. Passage 2 suggests that the previous precedent (Cicenia v. Lagay) is no longer controlling when it conflicts with the new principles being established.

The language used goes beyond mere criticism and indicates a clear intent to diminish or overturn the previous ruling, thus meeting the criteria for being overruled."

Key observations:
1. The Target Case is mentioned in multiple passages, but never explicitly overruled.
2. Passage 5 specifically states the case's authority was ""weakened"" by subsequent decisions, which is not the same as being overruled.

Key reasoning:
1. Passage 3 specifically mentions that the authority of Crooker v. California (the Target Case) was weakened by subsequent court decisions.
2. The passage lists specific cases that undermined the original ruling: Hamilton v. Alabama, White v. Maryland, and Massiah v. United States.

Key observations supporting this conclusion:

2. The citations appear to be referential and supportive, not dismissive
3. There are no explicit statements overruling or reversing the Malinski case
4. The passages use Malinski as an example in discussions about legal principles related to interrogation and confessions

The high confidence stems from the consistent and neutral treatment of the Target Case throughout the passages."

Key reasoning:
1. Passage 2 contains a critical analysis of the Wong Kim Ark case's dictum, but criticism alone does not constitute overruling.
2. The passage suggests alternative interpretations of the case's dictum but does not declare the case itself overruled.
3. The language used is analytical and interpretative, not declarative of overruling.

The key evidence for overruling includes:
1. Passage 1 explicitly notes they are re-examining the Frank v. Maryland decision
2. Passage 2 suggests Frank can be ""distinguished"" and was interpreted as creating a problematic exception to Fourth Amendment protections
3. Passages 3 and 4 systematically deconstruct the original Frank decision's reasoning about warrantless inspections
4. The overall tone and analysis indicates the Court is fundamentally rejecting the previous Frank v. Maryland ruling

The multiple target cases mentioned (359 U.S. 360, 359 U.S. at 367, 359 U.S. at 372, 359 U.S. at 383) all refer to different aspects of the original Frank v. Maryland case, and the passage clearly shows the Court is overruling that precedent."

Key points supporting this conclusion:

2. The Court is explicitly questioning the reasoning of previous cases like Frank v. Maryland and, by extension, Eaton v. Price.
3. The tone suggests a fundamental shift in understanding Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless searches.

Key observations supporting this conclusion:

2. The passages carefully analyze the Shapiro case's elements and explain why they do not apply in the current situation.

Key evidence for this conclusion:
1. The Court granted certiorari specifically to ""re-examine the constitutionality"" of the previous cases, including Kahriger.
2. The opinion critically analyzes the reasoning in Kahriger, pointing out flaws in its previous logic.
3. The Court explicitly states it is reconsidering whether Kahriger ""still have vitality"".
4. The language and analysis suggest a clear intent to overturn the previous decision's reasoning about self-incrimination.

The overruling is particularly clear from the note which asks whether the Court should ""overrule United States v. Kahriger"" and the subsequent detailed critique of the earlier case's reasoning."

2. Note: There's a second mention of Sullivan (274 U.S. at 263), which would receive the same analysis.

The key evidence for overruling includes:

3. In Passage 2, the case is referenced in discussing legal reasoning about privilege claims.
4. In Passage 3, the case is again cited to support characterizing a group as ""inherently suspect of criminal activities"".

Key points supporting the overruling:

2. In Passage 2, the case is explicitly cited as a key precedent about criminal case justiciability, with the court noting its holding that ""a criminal case did not become moot upon the expiration of the sentence imposed.""

For the Target Case `Dusch v. Davis, 387 U.S. 112`, I'll examine whether it was overruled in this passage.

In Passage 1, the majority opinion discusses Dusch v. Davis, stating it is ""not relevant to the problem of this case"" but does not explicitly overrule it.

In Passage 2, which appears to be a dissenting opinion, Dusch v. Davis is actually cited positively as a precedent supporting a similar legal principle about district residence requirements.

Importantly, the instructions specify that:
1. Only the majority opinion counts for overruling
2. Dissenting opinions do not constitute overruling
3. Simply discussing or distinguishing a case does not mean it is overruled

Therefore:

```json
{
  ""overruled"": ""no"", 
  ""confidence"": 0.95,
  ""rationale"": ""Neither the majority opinion nor the dissent explicitly overruled Dusch v. Davis. The majority merely stated it was not relevant to the current case, and the dissent actually cited it positively. No clear Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions were taken to overrule the Target Case.""

}
```

The key evidence for overruling comes from this specific passage: ""While the majority cited Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, as their authority for denying relief and while a few who took part in Colegrove put this type of question in the 'political' as distinguished from the 'justiciable' category, that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 202.""

This indicates that Baker v. Carr fundamentally changed the legal understanding established in Colegrove v. Green, effectively overruling its previous stance on the justiciability of electoral district controversies."

}
```

The key evidence supporting this conclusion is the phrase ""that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr"", which demonstrates the case is being referenced as a definitive legal precedent, not as a case being overturned or undermined. The passage uses Baker v. Carr to support the argument about voter classification and justiciable controversies, which further indicates the case is being affirmed rather than overruled."

}
```

The key evidence for overruling includes:
1. In Passage 2, the opinion states that ""the doctrine of collateral estoppel is a basic and essential part of the Constitution's prohibition against double jeopardy"" - directly contradicting the Hoag decision.
2. Passage 3 criticizes the ""same evidence"" test used in Hoag as providing ""little protection from multiple prosecution""
3. Passage 4 notes that until this case, the Court had ""never squarely held collateral estoppel to be a constitutional requirement""
4. The subsequent cases of Benton v. Maryland and North Carolina v. Pearce fundamentally changed the legal standard applied in Hoag, effectively overruling its reasoning about double jeopardy and due process.

The confidence is high because multiple passages demonstrate a clear shift in legal reasoning that undermines the Target Case's original holding."

Key observations supporting this conclusion:

Key observations supporting this conclusion:
1. In Passage 1, the Target Case is mentioned as part of the petitioner's argument.
2. In Passage 2, the court again references the Target Case, citing it in support of the argument about the risks of double jeopardy.
3. The passage does not contain any language suggesting the Target Case is being reversed or undermined.
4. The court appears to be using the Target Case as a persuasive precedent in its reasoning.

Therefore, based strictly on the provided passages, the Target Case has not been overruled."

Key observations supporting this conclusion:
1. The majority opinion continues to cite Duncan v. Louisiana as a key precedent
2. Dissenting opinions like Justice Marshall's explicitly adhere to the core holding of Duncan

Key observations supporting this conclusion:
1. The passages critically analyze previous assumptions about jury composition

Key observations:

The key points supporting this conclusion are:
1. The passages discuss the Target Case as part of a broader discussion about judicial incorporation of rights.
2. While the author (seemingly a dissenting justice) is critical of the incorporation doctrine, criticism does not equate to overruling.
3. The passages show the case being referenced and discussed, but do not show it being explicitly overruled by the court's majority opinion.

The Target Case is `398 U. S. 375`, which appears in both passages. I'll look for explicit or implicit negative actions regarding this case.

In both passages, the Target Case is cited as a reference point, but there are no direct statements overruling it. The passages discuss the case neutrally, using it as a supporting citation for legal arguments about maritime law.

The key considerations are:
- No explicit statement overrules the Target Case
- The case is cited as a supportive reference
- There are no implicit negative actions that would invalidate the case's holding

Therefore:

  ""confidence"": 0.95,

```

Key points supporting this analysis:
1. The Target Case is cited in a supportive context, not a critical one
2. There are no explicit statements overruling the case
3. The case is used to support the current legal reasoning about factual findings
4. No language suggests the Target Case has been invalidated or reversed

The key points supporting this conclusion are:
1. The Target Case is cited casually in a parenthetical reference

The key evidence supporting this conclusion is the phrase: ""But in neither case did the Court have occasion to re-examine the rule or to appraise the validity of its underpinnings or the propriety of its present application.""

The key points supporting this conclusion are:

Key points supporting this conclusion:
1. The passage explicitly states the Court ""did not reach the issue"" in the Target Case.

The key evidence is in Passage 1, which notes: ""the people of California adopted a constitutional amendment that authorized capital punishment, in effect negating a prior ruling by the Supreme Court of California in People v.

Key reasoning:
1. The passages discuss Railway Express II, but do not directly state that it is being overruled.
2. The text critically examines the legal principles surrounding business privilege taxes, but this critique does not constitute an overruling of the specific case.
3. The passages actually seem to use Railway Express II as a reference point for legal analysis, suggesting the case remains valid.
4. There are no explicit statements from the majority opinion indicating the case is being reversed or overruled.

The confidence is slightly lower than 1.0 due to the nuanced legal discussion, but the evidence strongly suggests the case has not been overruled."

Key observations supporting this conclusion:

1. Passage 6 specifically mentions Aldinger v. Howard (427 U.S. 1) was a reaffirmation of a previous ruling, not an overruling.
2. The passages discuss overruling other precedents, but not the Target Case itself.
3. The Target Case is mentioned multiple times as a reference point, but not as a case being directly overruled.
4. The majority opinion does not explicitly state that the Target Case is being overruled.

The dissenting opinion's references to the case do not constitute an official overruling, as dissents are not the court's official ruling."

The key evidence is in Passage 2, which directly states that the Court is overruling the principles established in the Target Case (United States v. Jenkins, 420 U.S. 358). The language is unambiguous about overturning the previous legal principle, which constitutes an explicit negative action against the Target Case."

The key evidence supporting this conclusion is that the passages:

- In Passage 2, the Target Case is again cited neutrally, discussing the purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause
- In Passage 3, the Target Case is cited in a footnote discussing potential risks of retrials

3. Critically, there are NO statements explicitly overruling the Target Case.

4. The passages discuss the Target Case, but do not undermine or reverse its legal standing.

The key points supporting this conclusion are:

The key points supporting this analysis are:
1. The passage references the Target Case (Funk) without explicitly overruling it
2. The passage actually quotes Funk positively, noting its progressive stance of declining to ""enforce ancient rule[s] of the common law""
3. While the passage discusses changes in legal thinking about spousal testimony privilege, it does not definitively state that Funk itself is overruled

The Target Case is `<targetCase>327 U.S. 416</targetCase>`, which appears in both passages.

In Passage 1, the case is mentioned in a context discussing how the Court has rejected previous limitations on state taxation of interstate commerce. The passage suggests that prior distinctions about interstate commerce have been undermined, but it does not explicitly overrule the Target Case.

In Passage 2, the Target Case is cited as an example supporting the principle that interstate commerce can be required to share the costs of state services. Again, this does not constitute overruling.

Therefore, based strictly on the provided passages:

```json

  ""confidence"": 0.95,
  ""rationale"": ""Neither passage explicitly overrules the Target Case. While the passages discuss evolving legal principles, they cite the Target Case as supportive precedent rather than rejecting or reversing it.""

The key is that merely discussing or citing a case does not constitute overruling. The passages reference the Target Case in a way that suggests it remains valid legal precedent."

Key observations:
1. In Passage 1, the case is quoted with approval: ""'[e]ven interstate business must pay its way.'""
2. In Passage 2, the case is cited as part of a historical discussion of Commerce Clause taxation principles.
3. In Passage 3, the case is again quoted to support the argument that interstate commerce must bear its fair share of state tax burden.

3. Passage 4 carefully parses the Yellow Cab case's holding, suggesting a refined interpretation rather than a complete overruling.

4. The passages show the Court is critically examining the doctrine but not wholesale rejecting the Yellow Cab case's fundamental principles.

   - `<targetCase>685 F.2d, at 918-919</targetCase>`

2. Analysis:
   - The passage discusses a Supreme Court case that is reversing a previous Court of Appeals decision.
   - The Court of Appeals decision (685 F.2d 913) is being directly challenged and reversed by the Supreme Court.
   - The majority opinion of the Court of Appeals is being overturned, with the dissenting opinion (685 F.2d, at 918-919) also being effectively rejected.

3. Determination:
   - The Target Cases have been overruled by the Supreme Court's decision.

The key considerations are:

Key observations supporting this conclusion:
1. The passages discuss the Target Case critically, showing its analytical limitations

3. However, there is no explicit statement that the Target Case itself is overruled
4. The passages trace the intellectual evolution of the legal doctrine, but do not definitively negate the original case's validity

The key evidence for overruling comes from Passage 3, which explicitly states the court is rejecting a specific proposition from the Bain case. The court carefully notes that they are not completely overturning Bain, but are specifically rejecting the notion that striking out parts of an indictment automatically invalidates the entire indictment.

The key evidence for overruling comes from Passage 3, which explicitly states that the second, more specific proposition from Bain ""did not long survive"" the original case.

The rationale is based on several key points from the passage:
1. The Supreme Court explicitly states they are granting certiorari and reversing the Court of Appeals decision.
2. The Court systematically dismantles the Court of Appeals' reasoning about the grand jury indictment.
3. The Court argues that the conviction is valid and that the Court of Appeals' interpretation conflicts with prior Supreme Court decisions.
4. The majority opinion clearly indicates that the Target Case's ruling should not stand, which constitutes an overruling."

The key evidence for overruling is:

The key points supporting this conclusion are:

1. Passage 3's critique of Chadwick as part of an inconsistent legal approach
2. Passage 7's explanation of how subsequent cases like Ross have effectively invalidated Chadwick's original principles
3. The overall tone of the passages suggesting a deliberate departure from Chadwick's warrant requirement standards"

```

The key evidence for overruling comes from Passage 3, where the text directly states that Sanders is being overruled. The passage provides a comprehensive explanation of the previous Sanders ruling and then explicitly notes that the Court is now overturning that decision. This is a clear and explicit negative action that meets the criteria for overruling the Target Case."

Key evidence supporting this conclusion:
1. The opening paragraph directly states they are considering ""whether Minturn should be overruled""
2. The passages critically analyze the original Minturn rationales
3. The Court is examining potential exceptions and limitations to the Minturn rule
4. The language suggests the Court views the previous interpretation of Minturn as potentially flawed

The high confidence reflects the Court's explicit discussion of potentially overruling the case, though the final definitive ruling is not shown in these excerpts."

Key observations supporting this conclusion:
1. The dissenting opinions (Passages 2 and 3) strongly defend the Townsend decision.
2. Justice O'Connor's dissent specifically states the Court is changing habeas corpus law in a way that affects Townsend, but does not claim the case is fully overruled.
3. Passage 4 suggests the Townsend decision was a novel interpretation at the time, but again does not indicate it was overruled.
4. The majority opinion does not explicitly state that Townsend is overruled, only that its application is being modified.

The nuanced treatment of the Townsend case suggests modification of its standards, but not a complete overruling, hence the ""no"" determination with a relatively high confidence level."

Key supporting evidence:

3. Passage 14 suggests the transition to strict scrutiny does not fundamentally change how remedial racial preferences are judged.
4. While the Court questions Fullilove's continued vitality, it does not definitively overrule the case.

Key evidence for overruling:

2. Passage 2 discusses Morgan in detail, showing how its reasoning was adopted by other circuit courts.
3. The passages critically examine the judicial function exception, but do not suggest Morgan itself is overruled.
4. The text treats Morgan as an important precedential case that influenced subsequent legal interpretations."

2. Justice Stevens' dissent suggests Hans should be reinterpreted, not completely overturned. For example, in Passage 9, he states Hans ""was indeed a leap in the direction of today's holding, even though it does not take the Court all the way.""

3. The majority opinion seems to continue relying on Hans's principles, as noted in Passage 1 where they cite Hans as establishing sovereign immunity doctrine.

4. The critiques focus on Hans's reasoning and interpretation, but do not definitively declare the entire case overruled.

5. The confidence is set at 0.85 to reflect the nuanced legal discussion, acknowledging there's room for interpretation but leaning towards the case not being fully overruled."

2. The majority opinion criticizes the reasoning in Union Gas
3. Passage 9 explicitly states the Court is overruling Union Gas
4. Multiple passages discuss the problems with the original Union Gas decision

The key evidence supporting this conclusion comes from Passage 4, which directly addresses attempts to overrule Meek v. Pittenger. The passage argues that:
1. The Court mistakenly claims recent cases have rejected Meek's assumptions
2. The Zobrest case (which the Court uses to suggest overruling) is not actually a comprehensive rejection of Meek
3. The author explicitly states the Court ""errs"" in claiming Meek is ""no longer good law""

While the passages show critical discussion of Meek, they do not constitute an actual overruling of the case. The language is explicitly defensive of Meek's core principles."

Key reasoning:

Key reasoning:
1. The passages reference Gray v. Mississippi multiple times, but do not explicitly overrule it.

Key observations supporting this conclusion:
1. Passage 2 specifically quotes Welch as saying it was ""assuming, without deciding"" a particular point.
2. The passages are analyzing the implications of various cases, including Welch, but not overruling Welch itself.
3. There is no direct statement that the Target Case (483 U.S. 468) has been overruled or invalidated."

3. While the language is critical, there is no explicit statement that the case is overruled
4. The criticism is part of a broader legal argument about sovereign immunity, not a direct reversal of the Target Case

- There are no explicit statements overruling the case

The passages show that while the understanding of the Establishment Clause has developed since Everson, the case remains an important precedent. The text discusses how the Court's interpretation of concepts like ""neutrality"" has evolved from Everson, but this evolution does not constitute overruling the original case.

Key points supporting the overruling:
1. The main opinion directly states they are overruling Evans v. Gore
2. The Court criticizes Evans' reasoning as no longer sound
3. Previous cases like O'Malley had already undermined Evans
4. The Court explicitly rejects Evans' interpretation of the Compensation Clause
5. Multiple justices (majority opinion and Justice Scalia) confirm the overruling

The overruling is comprehensive and unambiguous, making this a clear case of the Target Case being overruled."

The key evidence for overruling is in Passage 2 and Passage 3, where the Supreme Court:
