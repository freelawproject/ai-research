**Concurrence Opinion**
 And, most importantly for me, the selective incorporation process has the virtue of having already worked to make most of the Bill of Rights’ protections applicable to the States.  My view has been and is that the Fourteenth Amendment, as a whole, malees the Bill of Rights applicable to the States.  This would certainly include the language of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, as well as the Due Process Clause.  For a more thorough exposition of my views against this approach to the Due Process Clause, see my concurring opinion in Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 174 .  See Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 276 .  28 Edw. 3 , c. 3 (1354).  See Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1, 10</citedDecision> ; Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 406 ; Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 464 .
