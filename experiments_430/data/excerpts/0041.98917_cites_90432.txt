**Lead Opinion**
 Keeler v. Standard Folding Bed Co., 157 U. S. 659 .  The inquiry presented by this record, as we have stated it, is important and fundamental, and it requires that we shall determine the meaning of Congress when in Rev. Stats., § 4884, it provided that "Every patent shall contain ... a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns, for the term'of seventeen years, of the exclusive right to make, use, and vend the invention or discovery throughout the United States, and the Territories thereof.” We are concerned only,with the right to "use,” authorized to be granted by this statute, for it is under warrant of this *510 right only that the plaintiff can and does claim validity for its warning notice.  The words used in the statute are few, simple and familiar, they have not been changed substantially since they were first used in the Act of 1790, c. 7, 1 Stat. 109 ; Bauer v. O’Donnell, 229 U. S. 1, 9 , and their meaning would seem not to be doubtfpl if we can avoid reading into them that which they really do not contain.  In interpreting this language of the statute it will be of -service to keep in mind three rules long established by this court, applicable to the patent law and to the construction of patents, viz: 1st.  The scope of every patent is limited to the invention described in the claims contained in it, read in the light of the specification.  These so mark where the progress claimed by the patent begins and where it ends that they have been aptly likened to the description in a deed, which sets the bounds to the grant which it contains.  It is to the claims of every patent, therefore, that we must turn when we are seeking to determine what the invention is, the exclusive use of which is given to the inventor by the grant provided for by the statute, — “He can claim nothing beyond them.” Keystone Bridge Co. v. Phœnix Iron Co., 95 U. S. 274 ; Railroad Co. v. Mellon, <citedDecision>104 U. S. 112, 118</citedDecision> ; Yale Lock Mfg. Co. v. Greenleaf, 117 U. S. 554, 559 ; McClain v. Ortmayer, 141 U. S. 419, 424 .  2nd.  It has long been settled that the patentee receives nothing from the law which he did not have before, and that the only effect of his patént is to restrain others from manufacturing, using or selling that which he has invented.  The patent law simply protects him in the monopoly of that which he has invented and has described in the claims of his patent.  United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 167 U. S. 224, 239 ; Paper Bag Patent Case, 210 U. S. 405, 424 ; Bauer v. O’Donnell, 229 U. S. 1, 10 .  3rd.  Since Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1 , was decided in *511 1829 this court has consistently held that the primary purpose of our patent laws is not the creation of private fortunes for the owners of patents but is “to promote the progress of science and useful arts” (Constitution, Art. I, § 8), an object and purpose authoritatively expressed by Mr. Justice Story, in that decision, saying: “While one great object [of our patent laws] was, by holding out a reasonable reward to,inventors, and giving them an exclusive right to their inventions for a limited period, to stimulate the efforts of genius; the main object was 'to promote the progress of science-and useful arts.’” Thirty years later this court, returning to the subject, in Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322 , again pointedly and significantly says: “It is undeniably true, that the limited and temporary monopoly granted to inventors was never designed for their exclusive profit or advantage; the benefit to the public or community at large was another and doubtless the primary object in granting and securing that monopoly.” This court has never modified this statement of the relative importance of the public and private interests involved in every grant of a patent, even while declaring that in the construction of patents and the patent laws, inventors shall be fairly, even liberally, treated.  Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 241 ; Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 330 ; Walker on Patents, § 185.  These rules of law make it very clear that the scope of the grant which may be made to an inventor in a patent, pursuant to the statute, must be limited to the invention described in the claims'of his patent ( <citedDecision>104 U. S. 118</citedDecision> , supra) and to determine what grant may lawfully be so made we must hpid fast to the language of the act of Congress providing for it, which is found in two sections of the Revised Statutes.  Section 4886 provides that “Any person who has invented or discovered any new and useful art, ma *512 chine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new' and useful improvement thereof, ... may .  .  .  obtain a patent therefor”; and § 4884 provides that such patent when obtained “shall contain ... a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns ... .  of the exclusive right tó .  .
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting. I suppose that a patentee has no less property in his patented machine than any other owner, and that in addition to keeping the machine to himself the patent gives him the further right to forbid the rest of the world from making others like it. In short, for whatever motive, he may keep his device wholly out of use. Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., 210 U. S. 405, 422 . So much being undisputed, I cannot understand why he may not keep it out of use unless the licensee, or, for the matter of that, the buyer, will use some unpatented thing in connection with it. Generally speaking the measure of a condition is the consequence of a breach, and if that consequence is one that the owner may impose unconditionally, he may impose it conditionally upon a certain event. Ashley v. Ryan, 153 U. S. 436, 443 . Lloyd v. Dollison, 194 U. S. 445, 449 . Non debet, cui plus licet, quod minus est non licere. D. 50, 17, 21. *520 No doubt this principle might be limited or. excluded in cases where the condition tends to bring about a state of things that there iá a predominant public interest to prevent. But there is no predominant public interest to prevent a patented tea pot or film feeder from being kept from the public, because, as I have said, the patentee may-keep them tied up at will while his patent lasts. .Neither is there any such interest to prevent the purchase of the tea or films, that is made the condition of the use of the machine. The supposed contravention of public interest sometimes is stated as an attempt to extend the patent law to unpatented articles, which of course it is not, and more accurately as a possible domination to be established by such means. But the domination is ■ One only to the extent of the desire for the tea pot or film feeder, and if the owner prefers to keep the pot or the feeder unless you will buy his tea or films, I cannot see in allowing him the right to do so anything more than an ordinary incident of ownership, or at most, a consequence of the Paper Bag Case, on which, as it seems to me, this case ought to turn. See Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 242 . Not only do I believe that the rule that I advocate is right under the Paper Bag' Case, but I think that it has become a rule of property that law and justice require to be retained. For fifteen years, at least since Bement v. National Harrow Co., 186 U. S. 70, 88-93 , if not considerably earlier, 'the public has been encouraged by this court to believe that the law is as it was laid down in Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co., 77 Fed. Rep. 288, 25 C. C. A. 267 , and numerous other decisions of the lower courts. I believe that many and important transactions have taken place on the faith of those decisions, and that for that reason as well as for the first that I have given, the rule last announced in Henry v. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1 , should be maintained. I will add for its bearing upon Straus v. Victor Talking *521 Machine Co., ante, 490, that a conditional sale retaining the title until a future event after delivery, has been decided to be lawful again and again by this court. Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co., 239 U. S. 268, 272 . I confine myself to expressing my views upon the general and important questions upon which I have the misfortune to differ from the majority of the court. I leave on one side the question of the effect of the Clayton Act, as the court has done, and also what I might think if the Paper Bag Case were not upheld, or if the question were upon -the effect of a combination of patents such as to be contrary to the policy that I am bound to accept from the Congress of the United States. Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Van Devanter concur in this dissent.
**Combined Opinion**
We are concerned only with the right to "use," authorized to be granted by this statute, for it is under warrant of this *510 right only that the plaintiff can and does claim validity for its warning notice.  The words used in the statute are few, simple and familiar, they have not been changed substantially since they were first used in the Act of 1790, c. 7, 1 Stat. 109 ; Bauer v.
