**Dissenting Opinion**
277, 319, 322; see Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114, 128; Hawker v. New York, 170 U. S. 189, 198. The imposition of a particularly harsh deprivation without any discernible legitimate legislative purpose has similarly been characterized as penal. Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (Warren, C. J., announcing judgment). Similarly a punitive purpose has been found when such a purpose clearly appeared in the legislative history. Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martines, 372 U. S. 144, 169; United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 308-314. In other cases the analysis is more difficult. We summarized the relevant considerations in Kennedy v. <targetCase>Mendoza-Martinez, supra</targetCase>: “Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment— retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose u) which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions.” 372 TJ. S., at 168-169. An application of these criteria to § 504 compels the conclusion that it is regulatory rather than punitive. Congress’ concern with the possibility of political strikes is not simply a fictional concern advanced to mask a puni *477 tive purpose. Congress has sought to forestall political strikes since 1947, when it adopted § 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, which was sustained as a reasonable regulation in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382. Section 504 was adopted as a fairer and more effective method of dealing with the same evil.
