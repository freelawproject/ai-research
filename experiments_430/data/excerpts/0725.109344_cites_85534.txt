 Similarly, the Georgia Supreme Court stated, 233 Ga., at 722 , 214 S. E. 2d, at 355 : “[Petitioners] argue that an annual ad valorem tax is not a tax on imports within the meaning of *282 the federal constitutional provision.  We reject this argument on the basis of the above-cited authority.  [E. g., Low v. Austin. ]” Low v. Austin, supra, is the leading decision of this Court holding that the States are prohibited by the Import-Export Clause from imposing a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax on imported goods until they lose their character as imports and become incorporated into the mass of property in the State.  The Court there reviewed a decision of the California Supreme Court that had sustained the constitutionality of California's nondiscriminatory ad valorem tax on the ground that the Import-Export Clause only prohibited taxes upon the character of the goods as imports and therefore did not prohibit nondiscriminatory taxes upon the goods as property.  See 13 Wall., at 30-31 .  This Court reversed on its reading of the seminal opinion construing the Import-Export Clause, Brown v. Maryland, <citedDecision>12 Wheat. 419</citedDecision> (1827), as holding that “[w]hilst retaining their character as imports, a tax upon them, in any shape, is within the constitutional prohibition.” 13 Wall., at 34 .  Scholarly analysis has been uniformly critical of Low v. Austin .  It is true that Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland, supra, at 442</citedDecision> , said that “while [the thing imported remains] the property of the importer, in his warehouse, in the original form or package in which it was imported, a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports to escape the prohibition in the constitution.” Commentators have uniformly agreed that Low v. Austin misread this dictum in holding that the Court in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> included nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes among prohibited “imposts” or “duties,” for the contrary conclusion is plainly to be inferred from consideration of the specific abuses which led the Framers to include the Import- *283 Export Clause in the Constitution.  See, e. g., Powell, State Taxation of Imports — When Does an Import Cease to Be an Import?, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 858 (1945); Note, The Supreme Court, 1958 Term, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 126 , 176 (1959); Early & Weitzman, A Century of Dissent: The Immunity of Goods Imported for Resale From Nondiscriminatory State Personal Property Taxes, 7 Sw. U. L. Rev. 247 (1975); Dakin, The Protective Cloak of the Export-Import Clause: Immunity for the Goods or Immunity for the Process?, 19 La. L. Rev. 747 (1959).  Our independent study persuades us that a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax is not the type of state exaction which the Framers of the Constitution or the Court in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> had in mind as being an “impost” or “duty” and that Low v. Austin’s reliance upon the <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> dictum to reach the contrary conclusion was misplaced.  Ill One of the major defects of the Articles of Confederation, and a compelling reason for the calling of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, was the fact that the Articles essentially left the individual States free to burden commerce both among themselves and with foreign countries very much as they pleased.  Before 1787 it was commonplace for seaboard States with port facilities to derive revenue to defray the costs of state and local governments by imposing taxes on imported goods destined for customers in other States.  At the same time, there was no secure source of revenue for the central government.  James Madison, in his Preface to Debates in the Convention of 1787, 3 M. Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 542 (1911) (hereafter Farrand), provides a graphic description of the situation: “The other source of dissatisfaction was the peculiar situation of some of the States, which having no *284 convenient ports for foreign commerce, were subject to be taxed by their neighbors, thro whose ports, their commerce was carryed on.  New Jersey, placed between Phila. & N. York, was likened to a Cask tapped at both ends: and N. Carolina between Virga.  & S. Carolina to a patient bleeding at both Arms.  The Articles of Confederation provided no remedy for the complaint: which produced a strong protest on the part of N. Jersey; and never ceased to be a source of dissatisfaction & discord, until the new Constitution, superseded the old.” 3 And further, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 546-548: “Rh.  I.  was the only exception to a compliance with the recommendation from Annapolis [to have a Const. Convention], well known to have been swayed by an obdurate adherence to an advantage which her position gave her of taxing her neighbors thro’ their consumption of imported supplies, an advantage which it was foreseen would be taken from her by a revisal of the Articles of Confederation.  “The same want of a general power over Com *285 merce led to an exercise of this power separately, by the States, wch not only proved abortive, but engendered rival, conflicting and angry regulations.  Besides the vain attempts to supply their respective treasuries by imposts, which turned their commerce into the neighbouring ports, and to co-erce a relaxation of the British monopoly of the W. Indn.  navigation, which was attemted by Yirga.  .

 Nor will such taxation deprive the Federal Government of the exclusive right to all revenues from imposts and duties on imports and exports, since that right by definition only extends to revenues from exactions of a particular category; if nondiscriminatory ad valorem taxation is not in that category, it deprives the Federal *287 Government of nothing to which it is entitled.  Unlike imposts and duties, which are essentially taxes on the commercial privilege of bringing goods into a country, such property taxes are taxes by which a State apportions the cost of such services as police and fire protection among the beneficiaries according to their respective wealth; there is no reason why an importer should not bear his share of these costs along with his competitors handling only domestic goods.  The Import-Export Clause clearly prohibits state taxation based on the foreign origin of the imported goods, but it cannot be read to accord imported goods preferential treatment that permits escape from uniform taxes imposed without regard to foreign origin for services which the State supplies.  See, e. g., May v. New Orleans, 178 U. S. 496, 502-504, 507-509 (1900).  It may be that such taxation could diminish federal impost revenues to the extent its economic burden may discourage purchase or importation of foreign goods.  The prevention or avoidance of this incidental effect was not, however, even remotely an objective of the Framers in enacting the prohibition.  Certainly the Court in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> did not think so. See <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 443-444</citedDecision> .  Taxes imposed after an initial sale, after the breakup of the shipping packages, or the moment goods imported for use are committed to current operational needs are also all likely to have an incidental effect on the volume of goods imported; yet all are permissible.  See, e. g., Waring v. The Mayor, 8 Wall. 110 (1869) (taxation after initial sale); May v. New Orleans, supra (taxation after breakup of shipping packages); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 534 (1959) (taxation of goods committed to current operational needs by manufacturer).  What those taxes and nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes share, it should be emphasized, is *288 the characteristic that they cannot be selectively imposed and increased so as substantially to impair or prohibit importation.  7 Finally, nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes do not interfere with the free flow of imported goods among the States, as did the exactions by States under the Articles of Confederation directed solely at imported goods.  Indeed, importers of goods destined for inland States can easily avoid even those taxes in today’s world.  Modern transportation methods such as air freight and containerized packaging, and the development of railroads and the Nation’s internal waterways, enable importation directly into the inland States.

 Indeed, Professor Crosskey makes a persuasive demon *291 stration that the words “imposts” and “duties” as used in 1787 had meanings well understood to be exactions upon imported goods as imports.  “Imposts” were like customs duties, that is, charges levied on imports at the time and place of importation.  “Duties” was a broader term embracing excises as well as customs duties, and probably only capitation, land, and general property exactions were known by the term “tax” rather than the term “duty.” 1 W. Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United States 296-297 (1953).  12 The characteristic common to both “im *292 posts” and “duties” was that they were exactions directed at imports or commercial activity as such and, as imposed by the seaboard States under the Articles of Con *293 federation, were purposefully employed to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and tax States situated less favorably geographically.  In any event, since prohibition of nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxation would not further the objectives of the Import-Export Clause, only the clearest constitutional mandate should lead us to condemn such taxation.  The terminology employed in the Clause — “Imposts or Duties” — is sufficiently ambiguous that we decline to presume it was intended to embrace taxation *294 that does not create the evils the Clause was specifically intended to eliminate.  IV The Court in Low v. Austin nevertheless expanded the prohibition of the Clause to include nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes, and did so with no analysis, but with only the statement that <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> had marked the line “where the power of Congress over the goods imported ends, and that of the State begins, with as much precision as the subject admits.” 13 Wall., at 32 .  But the opinion in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> cannot properly be read to propose such a broad definition of “imposts” or “duties.” The tax there held to be prohibited by the Import-Export Clause was imposed under a Maryland statute that required importers of foreign goods, and wholesalers selling the same by bale or package, to obtain a license and pay a $50 fee therefor, subject to certain forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance.  The importers contested the validity of the statute, arguing that the license was a “palpable evasion” of the Import-Export Clause because it was essentially equivalent to a duty on imports.  They contended that asserted differences between the license fee and a tax directly imposed on imports were more formal than substantial: the privilege of bringing the goods into the country could not realistically be divorced from the privilege of selling the goods, since the power to prohibit sale would be the power to prohibit importation, <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 422</citedDecision> ; the payment of the tax at the time of sale rather than at the time of importation would be irrelevant since it would still be a tax on the same privilege at either time, <citedDecision>id., at 423</citedDecision> ; and the fact that a license operates on the person of the importer while the duty operates on the goods themselves is irrelevant in that either levy would directly increase the cost of the goods, <citedDecision>ibid.</citedDecision> Since the *295 power to impose a license on importers would also entail a power to price them out of the market or prohibit them entirely, the importers concluded that such a power must be repugnant to the exclusive federal power to regulate foreign commerce, <citedDecision>id., at 423-425</citedDecision> .  The Attorney General of Maryland, Roger Taney, later Chief Justice, defended the constitutionality of Maryland's law. He argued that the fee was not a prohibited "impost” or “duty” because the license fee was not a tax upon the imported goods, but on the importers, a tax upon the occupation and nothing more, and the Import-Export Clause prohibited only exactions on the right of importation and not an exaction upon the occupation of importers.  He contended that, in any event, the Clause, if not read as prohibiting only exactions on the right of importation, but, more broadly, as also prohibiting exactions on goods imported, would necessarily immunize imports from all state taxation at any time.  Moreover, if the privilege of selling is a concomitant of the privilege of importing, the argument proved too much; the importer could sell free of regulation by the States in any place and in any manner, even importing free of regulations concerning the bringing of noxious goods into the city, or auctioning the goods in public warehouses, or selling at retail or as a traveling peddler, activities that had traditionally been subject to state regulation and taxation.  The Court in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> refused to define "imposts” or “duties” comprehensively, since the Maryland statute presented only the question “whether the legislature of a State can constitutionally require the importer of foreign articles to take out a license from the State, before he shall be permitted to sell a bale or package so imported.” <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 436</citedDecision> .  However, in holding that the Maryland license fee was within prohibited “im *296 posts, or duties on imports .  .  the Court significantly characterized an impost or duty as “a custom or a tax levied on articles brought into a country," <citedDecision>id., at 437</citedDecision> , although also holding that, while normally levied before the articles are permitted to enter, the exactions are no less within the prohibition if levied upon the goods as imports after entry; since “imports” are the goods imported, the prohibition of imposts or duties on “imports” was more than a prohibition of a tax on the act of importation; it “extends to a duty levied after [the thing imported] has entered the country,” <citedDecision>id., at 438</citedDecision> .  And since the power to prohibit sale of an article is the power to prohibit its introduction into the country, the privilege of sale must be a concomitant of the privilege of importation, and licenses on the right to sell must therefore also fall within the constitutional prohibition.  <citedDecision>Id., at 439</citedDecision> .  Taney’s argument was persuasive, however, to the extent that the Court was prompted to declare that “the words of the prohibition ought not to be pressed to their utmost extent; ... in our complex system, the object of the powers conferred on the government of the Union, and the nature of the often conflicting powers which remain in the States, must always be taken into view .... [T]here must be a point of time when the prohibition ceases, and the power of the State to tax commences .  .  ..” <citedDecision>Id., at 441</citedDecision> .  The Court stated that there were two situations in which the prohibition would not apply.  One was the case of a state tax levied after the imported goods had lost their status as imports.  The Court devised an evidentiary tool, the “original package” test, for use in making that determination.  The formula was: “It is sufficient for the present to say, generally, that when the importer has so acted upon the thing imported, *297 that it has become incorporated and mixed up with the mass of property in the country, it has, perhaps, lost its distinctive character as an import, and has become subject to the taxing power of the State; but while remaining the property of the importer, in his warehouse, in the original form or package in which it was imported, a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports to escape the prohibition in the constitution.” <citedDecision>Id., at 441-442</citedDecision> .  “It is a matter of hornbook knowledge that the original package statement of Justice Marshall was an illustration, rather than a formula, and that its application is evidentiary, and not substantive .  .  .  Galveston v. Mexican Petroleum Corp., 15 F. 2d 208 (SD Tex. 1926).  The other was the situation of particular significance to our decision of this case, that is, when the particular state exaction is not a prohibited “impost” or “duty.” The Court first stated its view of the characteristics of prohibited state levies.  It said that the obvious clue was the express exception of the Import-Export Clause authorizing “imposts or duties” that “may be absolutely necessary for executing [the State’s] inspection Laws.” “[T]his exception,” said the Court, “in favour of duties for the support of inspection laws, goes far in proving that the framers of the constitution classed taxes of a similar character with those imposed for the purposes of inspection, with duties on imports and exports, and supposed them to be prohibited.” <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 438</citedDecision> (.emphasis supplied).  The characteristic of the prohibited levy, the Court said later in the opinon — illustrated by the Maryland license tax — was that “the tax intercepts the import, as an import, in its way to become incorporated with the general mass of property, and denies it the privilege of becoming so incorporated until it shall have contributed to the revenue of the State.” <citedDecision>Id., at 443</citedDecision> (em *298 phasis supplied).  The Court illustrated the kinds of state exactions that in its view fell without the prohibition as examples of neutral and nondiscriminatory taxation: a tax on itinerant peddlers, a service charge for the use of a public auctioneer, a property tax on plate or furniture personally used by the importer.  These could not be considered within the constitutional prohibition because they were imposed without regard to the origin of the goods taxed.  <citedDecision>Id., at 443, 444</citedDecision> .  In contrast, the Maryland exaction in question was a license fee which singled out imports, and therefore was prohibited because “the tax intercepts the import, as an import, in its way to become incorporated with the general mass of property.” <citedDecision>Id., at 443</citedDecision> .  (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, it is clear that the Court's view in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> was that merely because certain actions taken by the importer on his imported goods would so mingle them with the common property within the State as to “lose their distinctive character as imports” and render them subject to the taxing power of the State, did not mean that in the absence of such action, no exaction could be imposed on the goods.  Rather, the Court clearly implied that the prohibition would not apply to a state tax that treated imported goods in their original packages no differently from the “common mass of property in the country”; that xs, treated it in a manner that did not depend on the foreign origins of the goods.  Despite the language and objectives of the Import-Export Clause, and despite the limited nature of the holding in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> , the Court in Low v. Austin ignored the warning that the boundary between the power of States to tax persons and property within their jurisdictions and the limitations on the power of the States to impose imposts or duties with respect to “imports” was a subtle and difficult line which *299 must be drawn, as the cases arise.  Low v. Austin also ignored the cautionary remark that, for those reasons, it “might be premature to state any rule as being universal in its application.” 12 Wheat,, at 441., Although it was “sufficient” in the context of Maryland’s license tax on the right to sell imported goods to note that a tax imposed directly on imported goods which have not been acted upon in any way would clearly fall within the constitutional prohibition, that observation did not apply, as the foregoing analysis indicates, to a state tax which treated those same goods without regard to the fact of their foreign origin.  Low v. Austin compounded the error in misreading the <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> opinion by the further error of misreading the views of Mr. Chief Justice Taney as expressed in his opinion in the License Cases, 5 How. 504 (1847) (six Justices wrote separately in the cases).  As already observed, when the Chief Justice was Attorney General of Maryland he argued <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> for the State.  He had argued that the Maryland license fee requirement fell upon the importer, not the imported goods, and therefore fell without the Import-Export Clause’s prohibition against imposts or duties on “imports.” In the License Cases he observed that “further and more mature reflection has convinced me that the rule laid down [in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. Maryland] is a just and safe one, and perhaps the best that could have been adopted for preserving the right of the United States on the one hand, and of the States on the other, and preventing collision between them.  The question, I have already said, was a very difficult one for the judicial mind.  In the nature of things, the line of division is in some degree vague and indefinite, and I do not see how it could be drawn more accurately and correctly, or more in harmony with the obvious intention and object of this provision in the *300 constitution.  Indeed, goods imported, while they remain in the hands of the importer, in the form and shape in which they were brought into the country, can in no just sense be regarded as a part of that mass of property in the State usually taxed for the support of the State government.” 5 How., at 575 .  Low v. Austin quoted this excerpt, 13 Wall., at 33-34 , as supporting the holding, id., at 34 , that “a tax upon [imported goods], in any shape, is within the constitutional prohibition.” But Mr. Chief Justice Taney said much more in his opinion in the License Cases , and what he said further makes crystal clear that the prohibition applied only to state exactions upon imports as imports and did not apply to nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes.  For, continuing his analysis in the very paragraph from which Low v. Austin excerpted only a part, he concluded: “A tax in any shape .  .

 The respondents did not cross-petition from the affirmance of the holding of the Superior Court that the tubes in the corrugated shipping cartons were immune from the tax, and that holding is therefore not before us for review.  Madison noted the States’ aversion to the transfer of power to a central government “notwithstanding the urgent demands of the Federal Treasury; the glaring inadequacy of the authorized mode of supplying it, the rapid growth of anarchy in the Fedl.  System, and the animosity kindled among its members by their conflicting regulations.” 3 Farrand 544.  See also, e. g., 1 id., at 19 (Mr. Randolph’s comments concerning defects of Articles of Confederation); id., at 462 (Mr. Ghorum, in explaining why small States should not object to the formation of the Union, notes: “Should a separation of the States take place, the fate of N. Jersey wd.  be worst of all. She has no foreign commerce & can have but little.  Pa. & N. York will continue to levy taxes on her consumption”); 3 id., at 328-329 (Mr. Madison’s remarks during debate at the Virginia Convention).  See, e. g., Brown v. Maryland, <citedDecision>12 Wheat. 419, 439</citedDecision> (1827); Cook v. Pennsylvania, 97 U. S. 566, 574 (1878); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 534, 555-556 (1959) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); The Federalist Nos. 11 (Hamilton), 12 (Hamilton), 42 (Madison), 44 (Madison); 2 Farrand 135, 157-158, 169 (notes of Committee of Detail); id., at 441; 3 id., at 520-521 (letter of James Madison to Professor Davis); id., at 547-548.  See, e. g., Brown v. <citedDecision>Maryland, supra, at 439</citedDecision> ; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, supra, at 556 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) ; The Federalist No. 12.  See, e. g., Brown v. <citedDecision>Maryland, supra, at 440</citedDecision> ; Cook v. Pennsylvania, supra, at 574 ; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, supra, at 545 ; id., at 556-557 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); 2 Farrand 441-442, 589 ; 3 id., at 519 (letter of James Madison to Professor Davis).  Of course, discriminatory taxation in such circumstances is not inconceivable.  For example, a State could pass a law which only taxed the retail sale of imported goods, while the retail sale of domestic goods was not taxed.  Such a tax, even though operating after an “initial sale” of the imports would, of course, be invalidated as a discriminatory imposition that was, in practical effect, an impost.  Nothing in the opinion in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> should suggest otherwise.  The Court in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> merely presumed that at these later stages of commercial activity, state impositions would not be discriminatory.  But merely because <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> would have authorized a nondiscriminatory charge on even an importer’s use of the services of a public auctioneer, see <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 443</citedDecision> , does not mean that it would have disapproved the holding of Cook v. Pennsylvania, 97 U. S. 566 (1878), which invalidated a tax on the sale of goods by auction that discriminated against foreign goods.  Of course, depending on the relevant competition from domestic goods, an importer may be forced to absorb some of these ad valorem property assessments rather than passing them on to consumers.  Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia, 12 How. 299 (1852), upheld pilotage fees imposed by the city of Philadelphia.  It expressly rejected the argument that these fees were prohibited "imposts or duties,” id., at 314: "[The Import-Export Clause] was intended to operate upon subjects actually existing and well understood when the constitution was formed.  Imposts and duties on imports, exports, and tonnage were then known to the commerce of a civilized world to be as distinct from fees and charges for pilotage, and from the penalties by which commercial States enforced their pilot-laws, as they were from charges for wharfage or towage, or any other local port-charges for services rendered to vessels or cargoes; and to declare that such pilot-fees or penalties are embraced within the words imposts or duties on imports, exports, or tonnage, would be to confound things essentially different, and which must have been known to be actually different by those who used this language.  It cannot be denied that a tonnage duty, or an impost on imports or exports, may be levied under the name of pilot dues or penalties; and certainly it is the thing, and not the name, which is to be considered.  But, having previously stated that, in this instance, the law complained of does not pass the appropriate line which limits laws for the regulation of pilots and pilotage, the suggestion, that this law levies a duty on tonnage or on imports or exports, is not admissible; and, if so, it also follows, that this law is not repugnant to the first clause of the eighth section of the first article of the constitution, which declares that all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; for, if it is not to be deemed a law levying a duty, impost, or excise, the want of uniformity throughout the United States is not objectionable.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice White, concurring in the judgment. Being of the view that the goods involved here had lost their character as imports and that subjecting them to ad valorem taxation was consistent with the Constitution as interpreted by prior cases, including Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29 (1872), I would affirm the judgment. There is little reason and no necessity at this time to overrule Low v. Austin . None of the parties has challenged that case here, and the issue of its overruling has not been briefed or argued.

 Nor will such taxation deprive the Federal Government of the exclusive right to all revenues from imposts and duties on imports and exports, since that right by definition only extends to revenues from exactions of a particular category: if nondiscriminatory ad valorem taxation is not in that category, it deprives the Federal *287 Government of nothing to which it is entitled.  Unlike imposts and duties, which are essentially taxes on the commercial privilege of bringing goods into a country, such property taxes are taxes by which a State apportions the cost of such services as police and fire protection among the beneficiaries according to their respective wealth; there is no reason why an importer should not bear his share of these costs along with his competitors handling only domestic goods.  The Import-Export Clause clearly prohibits state taxation based on the foreign origin of the imported goods, but it cannot be read to accord imported goods preferential treatment that permits escape from uniform taxes imposed without regard to foreign origin for services which the State supplies.  See, e. g., May v. New Orleans, 178 U. S. 496, 502-504, 507-509 (1900).  It may be that such taxation could diminish federal impost revenues to the extent its economic burden may discourage purchase or importation of foreign goods.  The prevention or avoidance of this incidental effect was not, however, even remotely an objective of the Framers in enacting the prohibition.  Certainly the Court in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> did not think so. See <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 443-444</citedDecision> .  Taxes imposed after an initial sale, after the breakup of the shipping packages, or the moment goods imported for use are committed to current operational needs are also all likely to have an incidental effect on the volume of goods imported; yet all are permissible.  See, e. g., Waring v. The Mayor, 8 Wall. 110 (1869) (taxation after initial sale); May v. New Orleans, supra (taxation after breakup of shipping packages); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 534 (1959) (taxation of goods committed to current operational needs by manufacturer).  What those taxes and nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes share, it should be emphasized, is *288 the characteristic that they cannot be selectively imposed and increased so as substantially to impair or prohibit importation.  [7] Finally, nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes do not interfere with the free flow of imported goods among the States, as did the exactions by States under the Articles of Confederation directed solely at imported goods.  Indeed, importers of goods destined for inland States can easily avoid even those taxes in today's world.  Modern transportation methods such as air freight and containerized packaging, and the development of railroads and the Nation's internal waterways, enable importation directly into the inland States.
**Combined Opinion**
 "Imposts" were like customs duties, that is, charges levied on imports at the time and place of importation.  "Duties" was a broader term embracing excises as well as customs duties, and probably only capitation, land, and general property exactions were known by the term "tax" rather than the term "duty." 1 W. Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United States 296-297 (1953).  [12] The characteristic common to both "imposts" *292 and "duties" was that they were exactions directed at imports or commercial activity as such and, as imposed by the seaboard States under the Articles of Confederation, *293 were purposefully employed to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and tax States situated less favorably geographically.  In any event, since prohibition of nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxation would not further the objectives of the Import-Export Clause, only the clearest constitutional mandate should lead us to condemn such taxation.  The terminology employed in the Clause "Imposts or Duties"is sufficiently ambiguous that we decline to presume it was intended to embrace taxation *294 that does not create the evils the Clause was specifically intended to eliminate.  IV The Court in Low v. Austin nevertheless expanded the prohibition of the Clause to include nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes, and did so with no analysis, but with only the statement that <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> had marked the line "where the power of Congress over the goods imported ends, and that of the State begins, with as much precision as the subject admits." 13 Wall., at 32 .  But the opinion in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> cannot properly be read to propose such a broad definition of "imposts" or "duties." The tax there held to be prohibited by the Import-Export Clause was imposed under a Maryland statute that required importers of foreign goods, and wholesalers selling the same by bale or package, to obtain a license and pay a $50 fee therefor, subject to certain forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance.  The importers contested the validity of the statute, arguing that the license was a "palpable evasion" of the Import-Export Clause because it was essentially equivalent to a duty on imports.  They contended that asserted differences between the license fee and a tax directly imposed on imports were more formal than substantial: the privilege of bringing the goods into the country could not realistically be divorced from the privilege of selling the goods, since the power to prohibit sale would be the power to prohibit importation, <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 422</citedDecision> ; the payment of the tax at the time of sale rather than at the time of importation would be irrelevant since it would still be a tax on the same privilege at either time, <citedDecision>id., at 423</citedDecision> ; and the fact that a license operates on the person of the importer while the duty operates on the goods themselves is irrelevant in that either levy would directly increase the cost of the goods, <citedDecision>ibid.</citedDecision> Since the *295 power to impose a license on importers would also entail a power to price them out of the market or prohibit them entirely, the importers concluded that such a power must be repugnant to the exclusive federal power to regulate foreign commerce, <citedDecision>id., at 423-425</citedDecision> .  The Attorney General of Maryland, Roger Taney, later Chief Justice, defended the constitutionality of Maryland's law. He argued that the fee was not a prohibited "impost" or "duty" because the license fee was not a tax upon the imported goods, but on the importers, a tax upon the occupation and nothing more, and the Import-Export Clause prohibited only exactions on the right of importation and not an exaction upon the occupation of importers.  He contended that, in any event, the Clause, if not read as prohibiting only exactions on the right of importation, but, more broadly, as also prohibiting exactions on goods imported, would necessarily immunize imports from all state taxation at any time.  Moreover, if the privilege of selling is a concomitant of the privilege of importing, the argument proved too much; the importer could sell free of regulation by the States in any place and in any manner, even importing free of regulations concerning the bringing of noxious goods into the city, or auctioning the goods in public warehouses, or selling at retail or as a traveling peddler, activities that had traditionally been subject to state regulation and taxation.  The Court in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> refused to define "imposts" or "duties" comprehensively, since the Maryland statute presented only the question "whether the legislature of a State can constitutionally require the importer of foreign articles to take out a license from the State, before he shall be permitted to sell a bale or package so imported." <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 436</citedDecision> .  However, in holding that the Maryland license fee was within prohibited "imposts, *296 or duties on imports .  .  ." the Court significantly characterized an impost or duty as "a custom or a tax levied on articles brought into a country," <citedDecision>id., at 437</citedDecision> , although also holding that, while normally levied before the articles are permitted to enter, the exactions are no less within the prohibition if levied upon the goods as imports after entry; since "imports" are the goods imported, the prohibition of imposts or duties on "imports" was more than a prohibition of a tax on the act of importation; it "extends to a duty levied after [the thing imported] has entered the country," <citedDecision>id., at 438</citedDecision> .  And since the power to prohibit sale of an article is the power to prohibit its introduction into the country, the privilege of sale must be a concomitant of the privilege of importation, and licenses on the right to sell must therefore also fall within the constitutional prohibition.  <citedDecision>Id., at 439</citedDecision> .  Taney's argument was persuasive, however, to the extent that the Court was prompted to declare that "the words of the prohibition ought not to be pressed to their utmost extent; .  .  .  in our complex system, the object of the powers conferred on the government of the Union, and the nature of the often conflicting powers which remain in the States, must always be taken into view .  .  .  .  [T]here must be a point of time when the prohibition ceases, and the power of the State to tax commences.  .  .  ." <citedDecision>Id., at 441</citedDecision> .  The Court stated that there were two situations in which the prohibition would not apply.  One was the case of a state tax levied after the imported goods had lost their status as imports.  The Court devised an evidentiary tool, the "original package" test, for use in making that determination.  The formula was: "It is sufficient for the present to say, generally, that when the importer has so acted upon the thing imported, *297 that it has become incorporated and mixed up with the mass of property in the country, it has, perhaps, lost its distinctive character as an import, and has become subject to the taxing power of the State; but while remaining the property of the importer, in his warehouse, in the original form or package in which it was imported, a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports to escape the prohibition in the constitution." <citedDecision>Id., at 441-442</citedDecision> .  "It is a matter of hornbook knowledge that the original package statement of Justice Marshall was an illustration, rather than a formula, and that its application is evidentiary, and not substantive .  .  .  ." Galveston v. Mexican Petroleum Corp., 15 F. 2d 208 (SD Tex. 1926).  The other was the situation of particular significance to our decision of this case, that is, when the particular state exaction is not a prohibited "impost" or "duty." The Court first stated its view of the characteristics of prohibited state levies.  It said that the obvious clue was the express exception of the Import-Export Clause authorizing "imposts or duties" that "may be absolutely necessary for executing [the State's] inspection Laws." "[T]his exception," said the Court, "in favor of duties for the support of inspection laws, goes far in proving that the framers of the constitution classed taxes of a similar character with those imposed for the purposes of inspection, with duties on imports and exports, and supposed them to be prohibited." <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 438</citedDecision> (emphasis supplied).  The characteristic of the prohibited levy, the Court said later in the opinionillustrated by the Maryland license taxwas that "the tax intercepts the import, as an import, in its way to become incorporated with the general mass of property, and denies it the privilege of becoming so incorporated until it shall have contributed to the revenue of the State." <citedDecision>Id., at 443</citedDecision> (emphasis *298 supplied).  The Court illustrated the kinds of state exactions that in its view fell without the prohibition as examples of neutral and nondiscriminatory taxation: a tax on itinerant peddlers, a service charge for the use of a public auctioneer, a property tax on plate or furniture personally used by the importer.  These could not be considered within the constitutional prohibition because they were imposed without regard to the origin of the goods taxed.  <citedDecision>Id., at 443, 444</citedDecision> .  In contrast, the Maryland exaction in question was a license fee which singled out imports, and therefore was prohibited because "the tax intercepts the import, as an import, in its way to become incorporated with the general mass of property." <citedDecision>Id., at 443</citedDecision> .  (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, it is clear that the Court's view in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> was that merely because certain actions taken by the importer on his imported goods would so mingle them with the common property within the State as to "lose their distinctive character as imports" and render them subject to the taxing power of the State, did not mean that in the absence of such action, no exaction could be imposed on the goods.  Rather, the Court clearly implied that the prohibition would not apply to a state tax that treated imported goods in their original packages no differently from the "common mass of property in the country"; that is, treated it in a manner that did not depend on the foreign origins of the goods.  Despite the language and objectives of the Import-Export Clause, and despite the limited nature of the holding in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> , the Court in Low v. Austin ignored the warning that the boundary between the power of States to tax persons and property within their jurisdictions and the limitations on the power of the States to impose imposts or duties with respect to "imports" was a subtle and difficult line which *299 must be drawn as the cases arise.  Low v. Austin also ignored the cautionary remark that; for those reasons, it "might be premature to state any rule as being universal in its application." <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 441</citedDecision> .  Although it was "sufficient" in the context of Maryland's license tax on the right to sell imported goods to note that a tax imposed directly on imported goods which have not been acted upon in any way would clearly fall within the constitutional prohibition, that observation did not apply, as the foregoing analysis indicates, to a state tax which treated those same goods without regard to the fact of their foreign origin.  Low v. Austin compounded the error in misreading the <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> opinion by the further error of misreading the views of Mr. Chief Justice Taney as expressed in his opinion in the License Cases, 5 How. 504 (1847) (six Justices wrote separately in the cases).  As already observed, when the Chief Justice was Attorney General of Maryland he argued <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> for the State.  He had argued that the Maryland license fee requirement fell upon the importer, not the imported goods, and therefore fell without the Import-Export Clause's prohibition against imposts or duties on "imports." In the License Cases he observed that "further and more mature reflection has convinced me that the rule laid down [in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> ] is a just and safe one, and perhaps the best that could have been adopted for preserving the right of the United States on the one hand, and of the States on the other, and preventing collision between them.  The question, I have already said, was a very difficult one for the judicial mind.  In the nature of things, the line of division is in some degree vague and indefinite, and I do not see how it could be drawn more accurately and correctly, or more in harmony with the obvious intention and object of this provision in the *300 constitution.  Indeed, goods imported, while they remain in the hands of the importer, in the form and shape in which they were brought into the country, can in no just sense be regarded as a part of that mass of property in the State usually taxed for the support of the State government." 5 How., at 575 .  Low v. Austin quoted this excerpt, 13 Wall., at 33-34 , as supporting the holding, id., at 34 , that "a tax upon [imported goods], in any shape, is within the constitutional prohibition." But Mr. Chief Justice Taney said much more in his opinion in the License Cases , and what he said further makes crystal clear that the prohibition applied only to state exactions upon imports as imports and did not apply to nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes.
**Combined Opinion**
 [3]  Madison noted the States' aversion to the transfer of power to a central government "notwithstanding the urgent demands of the Federal Treasury; the glaring inadequacy of the authorized mode of supplying it, the rapid growth of anarchy in the Fedl.  System, and the animosity kindled among its members by their conflicting regulations." 3 Farrand 544.  See also, e. g., 1 id., at 19 (Mr. Randolph's comments concerning defects of Articles of Confederation); id., at 462 (Mr. Ghorum, in explaining why small States should not object to the formation of the Union, notes: "Should a separation of the States take place, the fate of N. Jersey wd.  be worst of all. She has no foreign commerce & can have but little.  Pa. & N. York will continue to levy taxes on her consumption"); 3 id., at 328-329 (Mr. Madison's remarks during debate at the Virginia Convention).  [4]  See, e. g., Brown v. Maryland, <citedDecision>12 Wheat. 419, 439</citedDecision> (1827); Cook v. Pennsylvania, 97 U. S. 566, 574 (1878); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 534, 555-556 (1959) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); The Federalist Nos. 11 (Hamilton), 12 (Hamilton), 42 (Madison), 44 (Madison); 2 Farrand 135, 157-158, 169 (notes of Committee of Detail); id., at 441; 3 id., at 520-521 (letter of James Madison to Professor Davis); id., at 547-548.  [5]  See, e. g., <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland, supra, at 439</citedDecision> ; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, supra, at 556 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); The Federalist No. 12.  [6]  See, e. g., <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland, supra, at 440</citedDecision> ; Cook v. Pennsylvania, supra, at 574 ; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, supra, at 545 ; id., at 556-557 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); 2 Farrand 441-442, 589; 3 id., at 519 (letter of James Madison to Professor Davis).  [7]  Of course, discriminatory taxation in such circumstances is not inconceivable.  For example, a State could pass a law which only taxed the retail sale of imported goods, while the retail sale of domestic goods was not taxed.  Such a tax, even though operating after an "initial sale" of the imports would, of course, be invalidated as a discriminatory imposition that was, in practical effect, an impost.  Nothing in the opinion in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> should suggest otherwise.  The Court in <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> merely presumed that at these later stages of commercial activity, state impositions would not be discriminatory.  But merely because <citedDecision>Brown</citedDecision> would have authorized a nondiscriminatory charge on even an importer's use of the services of a public auctioneer, see <citedDecision>12 Wheat., at 443</citedDecision> , does not mean that it would have disapproved the holding of Cook v. Pennsylvania, 97 U. S. 566 (1878), which invalidated a tax on the sale of goods by auction that discriminated against foreign goods.  [8]  Of course, depending on the relevant competition from domestic goods, an importer may be forced to absorb some of these ad valorem property assessments rather than passing them on to consumers.  [9] Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia, 12 How. 299 (1852), upheld pilotage fees imposed by the city of Philadelphia.  It expressly rejected the argument that these fees were prohibited "imposts or duties," id., at 314: "[The Import-Export Clause] was intended to operate upon subjects actually existing and well understood when the constitution was formed.  Imposts and duties on imports, exports, and tonnage were then known to the commerce of a civilized world to be as distinct from fees and charges for pilotage, and from the penalties by which commercial States enforced their pilot-laws, as they were from charges for wharfage or towage, or any other local port-charges for services rendered to vessels or cargoes; and to declare that such pilot-fees or penalties are embraced within the words imposts or duties on imports, exports, or tonnage, would be to confound things essentially different, and which must have been known to be actually different by those who used this language.  It cannot be denied that a tonnage duty, or an impost on imports or exports, may be levied under the name of pilot dues or penalties; and certainly it is the thing, and not the name, which is to be considered.  But, having previously stated that, in this instance, the law complained of does not pass the appropriate line which limits laws for the regulation of pilots and pilotage, the suggestion, that this law levies a duty on tonnage or on imports or exports, is not admissible; and, if so, it also follows, that this law is not repugnant to the first clause of the eighth section of the first article of the constitution, which declares that all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; for, if it is not to be deemed a law levying a duty, impost, or excise, the want of uniformity throughout the United States is not objectionable.
