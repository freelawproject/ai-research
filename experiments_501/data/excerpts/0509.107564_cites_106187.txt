 It is true that the absence of such penetration was at one time thought to foreclose further Fourth Amendment inquiry, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 457, 464, 466 ; Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129, 134-136 , for that Amendment was thought to limit only searches and seizures of tangible *353 property.  13 But “[t]he premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.” Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 304 .  Thus, although a closely divided Court supposed in Olmstead that surveillance without any trespass and without the seizure of any material object fell outside the ambit of the Constitution, we have since departed from the narrow view on which that decision rested.  Indeed, we have expressly held that the Fourth Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements, overheard without any “technical trespass under .  .  .  local property law.” Silverman v. United States, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 505, 511</citedDecision> .  Once this much is acknowledged, and once it is recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects people— and not simply “areas” — against unreasonable searches and seizures, it becomes clear that the reach of that Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure.  We conclude that the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the “trespass” doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling.  The Government’s activities in electronically listening to and recording the petitioner’s words violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied while using the telephone booth and thus constituted a “search and seizure” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  The fact that the electronic device employed to achieve that end did not happen to penetrate the wall of the booth can have no constitutional significance.  *354 The question remaining for decision, then, is whether the search and seizure conducted in this case complied with constitutional standards.  In that regard, the Government’s position is that its agents acted in an entirely defensible manner: They did not begin their electronic surveillance until investigation of the petitioner’s activities had established a strong probability that he was using the telephone in question to transmit gambling information to persons in other States, in violation of federal law. Moreover, the surveillance was limited, both in scope and in duration, to the specific purpose of establishing the contents of the petitioner’s unlawful telephonic communications.

 Cf. Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U. S. 622 ; Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77 .  In support of their respective claims, the parties have compiled competing lists of “protected areas” for our consideration.  It appears to be common ground that a private home is such an area, Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 , but that an open field is not.  Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 .  Defending the inclusion of a telephone booth in his fist the petitioner cites United States v. Stone, 232 F. Supp. 396 , and United States v. Madison, 32 L. W. 2243 (D. C. Ct. Gen. Sess.).  Urging that the telephone booth should be excluded, the Government finds support in United States v. Borgese, 235 F. Supp. 286 .  It is true that this Court has occasionally described its conclusions in terms of “constitutionally protected areas,” see, e. g., Silverman v. United States, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 505, 510, 512</citedDecision> ; Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 438-439 ; Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, 57, 59 , but we have never suggested that this concept can serve as a talismanic solution to every Fourth Amendment problem.  Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385 .  Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257 .  Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253 .  See Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 464-466 .  We do not deal in this case with the law of detention or arrest under the Fourth Amendment.  Based upon their previous visual observations of the petitioner, the agents correctly predicted that he would use the telephone booth for several minutes at approximately the same time each morning.

 Silverman v. United States.” To support its new interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, which in effect amounts to a rewriting of the language, the Court's opinion concludes that “the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been .  .  .  eroded by our subsequent decisions .  .  .  .” But the only cases cited as accomplishing this “eroding” are Silverman v. United States, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 505</citedDecision> , and Warden v. Hayden, 337 U. S. 294 .  Neither of these cases “eroded” Olmstead or Goldman.  Silverman is an interesting choice since there the Court expressly refused to re-examine the rationale of Olmstead or Goldman although such a reexamination was strenuously urged upon the Court by the petitioners’ counsel.  Also it is significant that in <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> , as the Court described it, “the eavesdropping was accomplished by means of an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied by the petitioners,” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 509</citedDecision> , thus calling into play the supervisory exclusionary rule of evidence.  As I have pointed out above, where there is an unauthorized intrusion, this Court has rejected admission of evidence obtained regardless of whether there has been an unconstitutional search and seizure.  The majority’s decision here relies heavily on the statement in the opinion that the Court “need not pause to consider whether or not there was a technical trespass under the local property law relating to party walls.” (At 511.) Yet this statement should not becloud the fact that time and again the opinion emphasizes that there has been an unauthorized intrusion: “For a fair reading of the record in this case shows that the eavesdropping was accomplished by means of an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied by the petitioners.” (At 509, emphasis added.) “Eavesdropping *371 accomplished by means of such a physical intrusion is beyond the pale of even those decisions .  .  .

“[DJecision here ... is based upon the reality of an actual intrusion .  .  .  .” (At 512, emphasis added.) “We find no occasion to re-examine Goldman here, but we decline to go beyond it, by even a fraction of an inch.” (At 512, emphasis added.) As if this were not enough, Justices Clark and Whittaker concurred with the following statement: “In view of the determination by the majority that the unauthorized physical penetration into petitioners’ premises constituted sufficient trespass to remove this case from the coverage of earlier decisions, we feel obliged to join in the Court’s opinion.” (At 513, emphasis added.) As I made clear in my dissent in Berger , the Court in <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> held the evidence should be excluded by virtue of the exclusionary rule and “I would not have agreed with the Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> .  .  .  had I thought that the result depended on finding a violation of the Fourth Amendment .  .  .  .” 383 U. S., at 79-80.

 But there is not.” (Dissenting opinion, at 508.) I made clear in that dissent my fear of the dangers involved when this Court uses the “broad, abstract and ambiguous concept” of “privacy” as a “comprehensive substitute for the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against 'unreasonable searches and seizures.’ ” (See generally dissenting opinion, at 507-527.) The Fourth Amendment protects privacy only to the extent that it prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures of “persons, houses, papers, and effects.” No general right is created by the Amendment so as to give this Court the unlimited power to hold unconstitutional everything which affects privacy.  Certainly the Framers, well acquainted as they were with the excesses of governmental power, did not intend to grant this Court such omnipotent lawmaking authority as that.  The history of governments proves that it is dangerous to freedom to repose such powers in courts.  For these reasons I respectfully dissent.  The first paragraph of my Brother Harlan's concurring opinion is susceptible of the interpretation, although probably not intended, that this Court “has long held” eavesdropping to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment and therefore “presumptively unreasonable in the absence of a search warrant.” There is no reference to any long line of cases, but simply a citation to <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> , and several cases following it, to establish this historical proposition.  In the first place, as I have indicated in this opinion, I do not read <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> as holding any such thing; and in the second place, <citedDecision>Silverman</citedDecision> was decided in 1961.  Thus, whatever it held, it cannot be said it “has [been] long held.” I think my Brother Harlan recognizes this later in his opinion when he admits that the Court must now overrule Olmstead and Goldman .  In having to overrule these cases in order to establish the holding the Court adopts today, it becomes clear that the Court is promulgating new doctrine instead of merely following what it “has long held.” This is emphasized by my Brother Harlan's claim that it is “bad physics” to adhere to Goldman .  Such an assertion simply illustrates the propensity of some members of the Court to rely on their limited understanding of modern scientific subjects in order to fit the Constitution to the times and give its language a meaning that it will not tolerate.
