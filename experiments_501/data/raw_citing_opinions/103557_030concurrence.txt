<author id="b251-7">Mr. Justice Jackson,</author>
<p id="AQ1">concurring:</p>
<p id="Ad0">I concur in the result reached by the Court, and I agree that the grounds of its decision are permissible ones under <page-number citation-index="1" label="182">*182</page-number>applicable authorities. But the migrations of a human being, of whom it is charged that he possesses nothing that can be sold and has no wherewithal to buy, do not fit easily into my notions as to what is commerce. To hold that the measure of his rights is the commerce clause is likely to result eventually either in distorting the commercial law or in denaturing human rights. I turn, therefore, away from principles by which commerce is regulated to that clause of the Constitution by virtue of which Duncan is a citizen of the United States and which forbids any State to abridge his privileges or immunities as such.</p>
<p id="b252-6">This clause was adopted to make United States citizenship the dominant and paramount allegiance among us. The return which the law had long associated with allegiance was protection. The power of citizenship as a shield against oppression was widely known from the example of Paul’s Roman citizenship, which sent the centurion scurrying to his higher-ups with the message: “Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.” I suppose none of us doubts that the hope of imparting to American citizenship some of this vitality was the purpose of declaring in the Fourteenth Amendment: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States . . .”</p>
<p id="b252-7">But the hope proclaimed in such generality soon shriveled in the process of judicial interpretation. For nearly three-quarters of a century this Court rejected every plea to the privileges and immunities clause. The judicial history of this clause and the very real difficulties in the way of its practical application to specific cases have been too well and recently reviewed to warrant repetition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b253-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="183">*183</page-number>While instances of valid “privileges or immunities” must be but few, I am convinced that this is one. I do not ignore or belittle the difficulties of what has been characterized by this Court as an “almost forgotten” clause. But the difficulty of the task does not excuse us from giving these general and abstract words whatever of specific content and concreteness they will bear as we mark out their application, case by case. That is the method of the common law, and it has been the method of this Court with other no less general statements in our fundamental law. This Court has not been timorous about giving concrete meaning to such obscure and vagrant phrases as “due process,” “general welfare,” “equal protection,” or even “commerce among the several States.” But it has always hesitated to give any real meaning to the privileges and immunities clause lest it improvidently give too much.</p>
<p id="AOm">This Court should, however, hold squarely that it is a privilege of citizenship of the United States, protected from state abridgment, to enter any state of the Union, either for temporary sojourn or for the establishment of permanent residence therein and for gaining resultant citizenship thereof. If national citizenship means less than this, it means nothing.</p>
<p id="b253-7">' The language of the Fourteenth Amendment declaring two kinds of citizenship is discriminating. It is: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” While it thus establishes national citizenship from the mere circumstance of birth within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, birth within a state does not establish citizenship thereof. State citizenship is ephemeral. It results only from residence and is gained or lost therewith. That choice of residence was subject to local approval is contrary to the inescapable implications of the westward movement of our civilization.</p>
<p id="b254-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="184">*184</page-number>Even as to an alien who had “been admitted to the United States under the Federal law,” this Court, through Mr. Justice Hughes, declared that “He was thus admitted with the privilege of entering and abiding in the United States, and hence of entering and abiding in any State in the Union.” <em>Truax </em>v. <em>Raich, </em><span class="citation" data-id="98542"><a href="/opinion/98542/truax-v-raich/#39" aria-description="Citation for case: Truax v. Raich">239 U. S. 33, 39</a></span>. Why we should hesitate to hold that federal citizenship implies rights to enter and abide in any state of the Union at least equal to those possessed by aliens passes my understanding. The world is even more upside down than I had supposed it to be, if California must accept aliens in deference to their federal privileges but is free to turn back citizens of the United States unless we treat them as subjects of commerce.</p>
<p id="b254-6">The right of the citizen to migrate from state to state which, I agree with Mr. Justice Douglas, is shown by our precedents to be one of national citizenship, is not, however, an unlimited one. In addition to being subject to all constitutional limitations imposed by the federal government, such citizen is subject to some control by state governments. He may not, if a fugitive from justice, claim freedom to migrate unmolested, nor may he endanger others by carrying contagion about. These causes, and perhaps others that do not occur to me now, warrant any public authority in stopping a man where it finds him and arresting his progress across a state line quite as much as from place to place within the state.</p>
<p id="b254-7">It is here that we meet the real crux of this case. Does “indigence” as defined by the application of the California statute constitute a basis for restricting the freedom of a citizen, as crime or contagion warrants its restriction? We should say now, and in no uncertain terms, that a man’s mere property status, without more, cannot be used by a state to test, qualify, or limit his rights as a citizen of the United States. “Indigence” in itself is neither a source of rights nor a basis for denying them. The mere <page-number citation-index="1" label="185">*185</page-number>state of being without funds is a neutral fact — constitutionally an irrelevance, like race, creed, or color. I agree with what I understand to be the holding of the Court that cases which may indicate the contrary are overruled.</p>
<p id="b255-7">' ’""Any measure which would divide our citizenry on the basis of property into one class free to move from state to state and another class that is poverty-bound to the place where it has suffered misfortune is not only at war with the habit and custom by which our country has expanded, but is also a short-sighted blow at the security of property itself. Property can have no more dangerous, even if unwitting, enemy than one who would make its possession a pretext for unequal or exclusive civil rights. Where those rights are derived from national citizenship no state may impose such a test, and whether the Congress could do so we are not called upon to inquire.</p>
<p id="b255-8">I think California had no right to make the condition of Duncan’s purse, with no evidence of violation by him of any law or social policy which caused it, the basis of excluding him or of punishing one who extended him aid.</p>
<p id="b255-9">If I doubted whether his federal citizenship alone were enough to open the gates of California to Duncan, my doubt would disappear on consideration of the obligations of such citizenship. Duncan owes a duty to render military service, and this Court has said that this duty is the result of his citizenship. Mr. Chief Justice White declared in the <em>Selective Draft Law Cases, </em><span class="citation" data-id="99053"><a href="/opinion/99053/selective-draft-law-cases/" aria-description="Citation for case: Selective Draft Law Cases">245 U. S. 366</a></span>, 378: “It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel it.”{'A contention that a citizen’s duty to render military service is suspended by “indigence” would meet with little favor. Rich or penniless, Duncan’s citizenship under the Con<page-number citation-index="1" label="186">*186</page-number>stitution pledges his strength to the defense of California as a part of the United States, and his right to migrate to any part of the land he must defend is something she must respect under the same instrument. Unless this Court is willing to say that citizenship of the United States means at least this much to the citizen, then our heritage of constitutional privileges and immunities is only a promise to the ear to be broken to the hope, a teasing illusion like a munificent bequest in a pauper’s will.</p>
