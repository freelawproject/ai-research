 “Now, so far as the counts two and four, that is the counts of armed robbery, of which you have found the defendant guilty, then you may find— inquire into these aggravating circumstances.  “That the offense of armed robbery was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of two capital felonies, to-wit the murders of [Simmons and Moore] or that the offender committed the offense of armed robbery for the purpose of receiving money and the automobile set forth in the indictment, or three, that the offense of armed robbery was outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman in that they involved the depravity of the mind of the defendant.  *218 “Now, if you find that there was one or more of these aggravating circumstances existed beyond a reasonable doubt, then and I refer to each individual count, then you would be authorized to consider imposing the sentence of death.  “If you do not find that one of these aggravating circumstances existed beyond a reasonable doubt, in either of these counts, then you would not be authorized to consider the penalty of death.  In that event, the sentence as to counts one and three, those are the counts wherein the defendant was found guilty of murder, the sentence could be imprisonment for life.” Tr. 476-477.  The jury returned the death penalty on all four counts finding all the aggravating circumstances submitted to it, except that it did not find the crimes to have been “outrageously or wantonly vile,” etc. On appeal the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the death sentences on the murder counts and vacated the death sentences on the robbery counts.  <citedDecision>233 Ga. 117</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>210 S. E. 2d 659</citedDecision> (1974).  It concluded that the murder sentences were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; that the evidence supported the finding of a statutory aggravating factor with respect to the murders; and, citing several cases in which the death penalty had been imposed previously for murders of persons who had witnessed a robbery, held: “After considering both the crimes and the defendant and after comparing the evidence and the sentences in this case with those of previous murder cases, we are also of the opinion that these two sentences of death are not excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases *219 which are hereto attached.” 5 <citedDecision>Id., at 127</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>210 S. E. 2d, at 667</citedDecision> .  However, it held with respect to the robbery sentences: “Although there is no indication that these two *220 sentences were imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, the sentences imposed here are unusual in that they are rarely imposed for this offense.  Thus, under the test provided by statute for comparison (Code Ann. §27-2537 (c), (3)), they must be considered to be excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.” Ibid. Accordingly, the sentences on the robbery counts were vacated.  Ill The threshold question in this case is whether the death penalty may be carried out for murder under the Georgia legislative scheme consistent with the decision in Furman v. Georgia, supra. In Furman , this Court held that as a result of giving the sentencer unguided discretion to impose or not to impose the death penalty for murder, the penalty was being imposed discrimina- *221 torily, 6 wantonly and freakishly, 7 and so infrequently 8 that any given death sentence was cruel and unusual.  Petitioner argues that, as in Furman , the jury is still the sentencer; that the statutory criteria to be considered by the jury on the issue of sentence under Georgia’s new statutory scheme are vague and do not purport to be all-inclusive; and that, in any event, there are no circumstances under which the jury is required to impose the death penalty.  9 Consequently, the petitioner argues that the death penalty will inexorably be imposed in as discriminatory, standardless, and rare a manner as it was imposed under the scheme declared invalid in Furman .  The argument is considerably overstated.

 A homicide is committed in the perpetration of a felony when it is committed by the accused while he is engaged in the performance of any act required for the full execution of such felony.  “I charge you that if you find and believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the homicide alleged in this indictment was caused by *216 the defendant while he, the said accused was in the commission of a felony as I have just given you in this charge, you would be authorized to convict the defendant of murder.  "And this you would be authorized to do whether the defendant intended to kill the deceased or not.  A homicide, although unintended, if committed by the accused at the time he is engaged in the commission of some other felony constitutes murder.  “In order for a killing to have been done in perpetration or attempted perpetration of a felony, or of a particular felony, there must be some connection as I previously charged you between the felony and the homicide.  “Before you would be authorized to find the defendant guilty of the offense of murder, you must find and believe beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did, with malice aforethought either express or implied cause the deaths of [Simmons or Moore] or you must find and believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, while in the commission of a felony caused the death of these two victims just named.  “I charge you, that if you find and believe that, at any time prior to the date this indictment was returned into this court that the defendant did, in the county of Gwinnett, State of Georgia, with malice aforethought kill and murder the two men just named in the way and manner set forth in the indictment or that the defendant caused the deaths of these two men in the way and manner set forth in the indictment, while he, the said accused was in the commission of a felony, then in either event, you would be authorized to find the defendant guilty of murder.” In a subsequently decided robbery-murder case, the Georgia Supreme Court had the following to say about the same “similar cases” referred to in this case: “We have compared the evidence and sentence in this case with other similar eases and conclude the sentence of death is not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in those cases. Those similar cases we considered in reviewing the case are: Lingo v. State, 226 Ga. 496 ( 175 SE2d 657 ), Johnson v. State, 226 Ga. 511 ( 175 SE2d 840 ), Pass v. State, 227 Ga. 730 ( 182 SE2d 779 ), Watson v. State, 229 Ga. 787 ( 194 SE2d 407 ), Scott v. State, 230 Ga. 413 ( 197 SE2d 338 ), Kramer v. State, 230 Ga. 855 ( 199 SE2d 805 ), and Gregg v. State, <citedDecision>233 Ga. 117</citedDecision> ( <citedDecision>210 SE2d 659</citedDecision> ).  “In each of the comparison cases cited, the records show that the accused was found guilty of murder of the victim of the robbery or burglary committed in the course of such robbery or burglary.  In each of those cases, the jury imposed the sentence of death.  In Pass v. State, supra, the murder took place in the victim’s home, as occurred in the case under consideration.  “We find that the sentence of death in this case is not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.  Code Ann. § 27-2537 (c) (3).  Notwithstanding the fact that there have been cases in which robbery victims were murdered and the juries imposed life sentences (see Appendix), the cited cases show that juries faced with similar factual situations have imposed death sentences.
