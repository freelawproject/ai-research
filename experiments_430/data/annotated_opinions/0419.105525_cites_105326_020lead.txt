 The court-martial asserted jurisdiction over Mrs. Covert under Article 2 (11) of the UCMJ, 2 which provides: “The following persons are subject to this code: “(11) Subject to the provisions of any treaty or agreement to which the United States is or may be a party or to any accepted rule of international law, *4 all persons serving with, employed by, or accompanying the armed forces without the continental limits of the United States .  .  .  Counsel for Mrs. Covert contended that she was insane at the time she killed her husband, but the military tribunal found her guilty of murder and sentenced her to life imprisonment.  The judgment was affirmed by the Air Force Board of Review, 16 CMR 465 , but was reversed by the Court of Military Appeals, 6 USCMA 48 , because of prejudicial errors concerning the defense of insanity.  While Mrs. Covert was being held in this country pending a proposed retrial by court-martial in the District of Columbia, her counsel petitioned the District Court for a writ of habeas corpus to set her free on the ground that the Constitution forbade her trial by military authorities.  Construing this Court's decision in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, <citedDecision>350 U. S. 11</citedDecision> , as holding that “a civilian is entitled to a civilian trial” the District Court held that Mrs. Covert could not be tried by court-martial and ordered her released from custody.  The Government appealed directly to this Court under 28 U. S. C. § 1252 .  See 350 U. S. 985 .  In No. 713 Mrs. Dorothy Smith killed her husband, an Army officer, at a post in Japan where she was living with him.  She was tried for murder by a court-martial and despite considerable evidence that she was insane was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.  The judgment was approved by the Army Board of Review, 10 CMR 350 , 13 CMR 307 , and the Court of Military Appeals, 5 USCMA 314 .  Mrs. Smith was then confined in a federal penitentiary in West Virginia.

 On several occasions this Court has been faced with an attempted expansion of the jurisdiction of military courts.  Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 , one of the great landmarks in this Court’s history, held that military authorities were without power to try civilians not in the military or naval service by declaring martial law in an area where the civil *31 administration was not deposed and the courts were not closed.  55 In a stirring passage the Court proclaimed: “Another guarantee of freedom was broken when Milligan was denied a trial by jury.  The great minds of the country have differed on the correct interpretation to be given to various provisions of the Federal Constitution; and judicial decision has been often invoked to settle their true meaning; but until recently no one ever doubted that the right of trial by jury was fortified in the organic law against the power of attack.  It is now assailed; but if ideas can be expressed in words, and language has any meaning, this right — one of the most valuable in a free country — is preserved to everyone accused of crime who is not attached to the army, or navy, or militia in actual service.” 56 In Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304 , the Court reasserted the principles enunciated in Ex parte Milligan and reaffirmed the tradition of military subordination to civil authorities and institutions.  It refused to sanction the military trial of civilians in Hawaii during wartime despite government claims that the needs of defense made martial law imperative.  Just last Term, this Court held in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, <citedDecision>350 U. S. 11</citedDecision> , that military courts could not constitutionally try a discharged serviceman for an offense which he had allegedly committed while in the armed forces.  It was decided (1) that since Toth was a civilian he could not be tried by military court-martial, 57 *32 and (2) that since he was charged with murder, a “crime” in the constitutional sense, he was entitled to indictment by a grand jury, jury trial, and the other protections contained in Art. Ill, § 2 and the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments.  The Court pointed out that trial by civilian courts was the rule for persons who were not members of the armed forces.  There are no supportable grounds upon which to distinguish the Toth case from the present cases. Toth, Mrs. Covert, and Mrs. Smith were all civilians.  All three were American citizens.  All three were tried for murder.  All three alleged crimes were committed in a foreign country.

 61 The Government urges that the concept “in the field” should be broadened to reach dependents accompanying the military forces overseas under the conditions of world tension which exist at the present time.  It points out how the “war powers” include authority to prepare defenses and to establish our military forces in defensive posture about the world.  While we recognize that the “war powers” of the Congress and the Executive are *35 broad, 62 we reject the Government’s argument that present threats to peace permit military trial of civilians accompanying the armed forces overseas in an area where no actual hostilities are under way.  63 The exigencies which have required military rule on the battlefront are not present in areas where no conflict exists.  Military trial of civilians “in the field” is an extraordinary jurisdiction and it should not be expanded at the expense of the Bill of Rights.  We agree with Colonel Winthrop, an expert on military jurisdiction, who declared: “a statute cannot be framed by which a civilian can lawfully be made amenable to the military jurisdiction in time of peace.” 64 (Emphasis not supplied.) As this Court stated in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, <citedDecision>350 U. S. 11</citedDecision> , the business of soldiers is to fight and prepare to fight wars, not to try civilians for their alleged crimes.  Traditionally, military justice has been a rough form of justice emphasizing summary procedures, *36 speedy convictions and stern penalties with a view to maintaining obedience and fighting fitness in the ranks. Because of its very nature and purpose the military must place great emphasis on discipline and efficiency.  Correspondingly, there has always been less emphasis in the military on protecting the rights of the individual than in civilian society and in civilian courts.  Courts-martial are typically ad hoc bodies appointed by a military officer from among his subordinates.  They have always been subject to varying degrees of “command influence.” 65 In essence, these tribunals are simply executive tribunals whose personnel are in the executive chain of command.  Frequently, the members of the court-martial must look to the appointing officer for promotions, advantageous assignments and efficiency ratings — in short, for their future progress in the service.  Conceding to military personnel that high degree of honesty and sense of justice which nearly all of them undoubtedly have, the members of a court-martial, in the nature of things, do not and cannot have the independence of jurors drawn from the general public or of civilian judges.

 See Dorr v. United States, 195 U. S. 138, 144-148 .  The right to trial by jury in a criminal case is twice guaranteed by the Constitution.  It is common knowledge that the fear that jury trial might be abolished was one of the principal sources of objection to the Federal Constitution and was an important reason for the adoption of the Bill of Rights.  The Sixth Amendment reaffirmed the right to trial by jury in criminal cases and the Seventh Amendment insured such trial in civil controversies.  See 2 Elliot’s Debates (2d ed. 1836) passim; 3 id. passim.  3 Blackstone’s Commentaries 379.  As to the importance of trial by jury, see also Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 122-123 ; Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343, 349-350 ; United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, <citedDecision>350 U.

De Tocqueville observed: “The institution of the jury .  .  .  places the real direction of society in the hands of the governed, or of a portion of the governed, and not in that of the government.  ...

We have examined all the cases of military trial of civilians by the *34 British or American Armies prior to and contemporaneous with the Constitution that the Government has advanced or that we were able to find by independent research.  Without exception these cases appear to have involved trials during wartime in the area of battle— “in the field” — or in occupied enemy territory.  Even in these areas there are only isolated instances of military trial of “dependents” accompanying the armed forces.  Apparently the normal method of disciplining camp followers was to expel them from the camp or to take away their ration privileges.  Experts on military law, the Judge Advocate General and the Attorney General have repeatedly taken the position that “in the field” means in an area of actual fighting.

 .  and punished at the discretion of [a court-martial].” In 1942 the Judge Advocate General ruled that a civilian employee of a contractor engaged in construction at an Army base could be tried by court-martial under the predecessor of Article 134 for advising his fellow employees to slow down at their work.

According to the Government’s figures almost 95% of the civilians tried abroad by army courts-martial during the six-year period from 1949-1955 were tried for minor offenses.  In this country “petty offenses” by civilians on military reservations are tried by civilian commissioners unless the alleged offender chooses trial in the Federal District Court. 18 U. S.
