 Recognizing that the writ of habeas corpus “is a bulwark against convictions that violate fundamental fairness,” we *748 also acknowledged that “the Great Writ entails significant costs.” Id., at 126 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The most significant of these is the cost to finality in criminal litigation that federal collateral review of state convictions entails: “As Justice Harlan once observed, ‘[b]oth the individual criminal defendant and society have an interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation, and that attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community.’ Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1963) (dissenting opinion).” Id., at 127 .  Moreover, “[f]ederal intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate both the States’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.” Id., at 128 .  These costs are particularly high, we explained, when a state prisoner, through a procedural default, prevents adjudication of his constitutional claims in state court. Because these costs do not depend on the type of claim the prisoner raised, we reaffirmed that a state procedural default of any federal claim will bar federal habeas unless the petitioner demonstrates cause and actual prejudice.  Id., at 129 .  We also explained in Engle that the cause and prejudice standard will be met in those cases where review of a state prisoner’s claim is necessary to correct “a fundamental miscarriage of justice.” Id., at 135 .  See also Murray v. Carrier, <citedDecision>477 U. S. 478, 496</citedDecision> (1986) (“[Wjhere a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default”).  In <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> , we applied the cause and prejudice standard to a petitioner’s failure to raise a particular claim in his state *749 court appeal.  Again, we emphasized the important interests served by state procedural rules at every stage of the judicial process and the harm to the States that results when federal courts ignore these rules: “A State’s procedural rules serve vital purposes at trial, on appeal, and on state collateral attack.  .  .  .  “.  .

Failure to raise a claim on appeal reduces the finality of appellate proceedings, deprives the appellate court of an opportunity to review trial error, and ‘undercuts] the State’s ability to enforce its procedural rules.’ Engle, 456 U.

In <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> , as in Sykes , we left open the question whether Fay’s deliberate bypass standard continued to apply under the facts of that case, where a state prisoner has defaulted his entire appeal.  See <citedDecision>Carrier, supra, at 492</citedDecision> ; Sykes, supra, at 88, n. 12 .  We are now required to answer this question.  By filing late, Coleman defaulted his entire state collateral appeal.  This was no doubt an inadvertent error, and respondent concedes that Coleman did not “understandingly and knowingly” forgo the privilege of state collateral appeal.  See Fay, 372 U. S., at 439 .  Therefore, if the Fay deliberate bypass standard still applies, Coleman’s state procedural default will not bar federal habeas.  In Harris, we described in broad terms the application of the cause and prejudice standard, hinting strongly that Fay had been superseded: “Under Sykes and its progeny, an adequate and independent finding of procedural default will bar federal ha-beas review of the federal claim, unless the habeas petitioner can show ‘cause’ for the default and ‘prejudice *750 attributable thereto,' Murray v. Carrier, <citedDecision>477 U. S. 478, 485</citedDecision> (1986), or demonstrate that failure to consider the federal claim will result in a ‘ “ ‘fundamental miscarriage of justice.”” <citedDecision>Id., at 495</citedDecision> , quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 135 (1982).  See also Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 537 (1986).” Harris, 489 U. S., at 262 .  We now make it explicit: In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  Fay was based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules.  The several cases after Fay that applied the cause and prejudice standard to a variety of state procedural defaults represent a different view.  We now recognize the important interest in finality served by state procedural rules, and the significant harm to the States that results from the failure of federal courts to respect them.  Cf. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491 (1991) (“Though Fay v. Noia, supra, may have cast doubt upon these propositions, since Fay we have taken care in our habeas corpus decisions to reconfirm the importance of finality”).  <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> applied the cause and prejudice standard to the failure to raise a particular claim on appeal.  There is no reason that the same standard should not apply to a failure to appeal at all. All of the State’s interests —in channeling the resolution of claims to the most appropriate forum, in finality, and in having an opportunity to correct its own errors — are implicated whether a prisoner defaults one claim or all of them.  A federal court generally should not interfere in either case. By applying the cause and prejudice standard uniformly to all independent and adequate state procedural *751 defaults, we eliminate the irrational distinction between Fay and the rule of cases like Francis, Sykes, Engle, and <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> .  We also eliminate inconsistency between the respect federal courts show for state procedural rules and the respect they show for their own.  This Court has long understood the vital interest served by federal procedural rules, even when they serve to bar federal review of constitutional claims.  In Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414 (1944), for example, the Court explained: “No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.” Id., at 444 .  In Browder v. Director, Illinois Dept. of Corrections, 434 U. S. 257 (1978), we held that the appeal in a state prisoner federal habeas case was barred because untimely under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a).  In describing the “mandatory and jurisdictional” nature of the Rule and its justification, we might as well have been describing Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:5(a): “This 30-day time limit is ‘mandatory and jurisdictional.’ The purpose of the rule is clear: It is ‘to set a definite point of time when litigation should be at an end, unless within that time the prescribed application has been made; and if it has not been, to advise prospective appel-lees that they are freed of the appellant’s demands.  Any other construction of the statute would defeat its purpose.’ Matton Steamboat [Co. v. Murphy, 319 U. S. 412, 415 (1943)].” Browder, supra, at 264 (citations omitted).  No less respect should be given to state rules of procedure.  See Francis, 425 U. S., at 541-542 .  *752 V A Coleman maintains that there was cause for his default.  The late filing was, he contends, the result of attorney error of sufficient magnitude to excuse the default in federal habeas.  Murray v. <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> considered the circumstances under which attorney error constitutes cause.  Carrier argued that his attorney’s inadvertence in failing to raise certain claims in his state appeal constituted cause for the default sufficient to allow federal habeas review.  We rejected this claim, explaining that the costs associated with an ignorant or inadvertent procedural default are no less than where the failure to raise a claim is a deliberate strategy: It deprives the state courts of the opportunity to review trial errors.  When a federal habeas court hears such a claim, it undercuts the State’s ability to enforce its procedural rules just as surely as when the default was deliberate.  477 U. S., at 487.  We concluded: “So long as a defendant is represented by counsel whose performance is not constitutionally ineffective under the standard established in Strickland v. Washington, [ 466 U. S. 668 (1984)], we discern no inequity in requiring him to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.” Id., at 488.  Applying the <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> rule as stated, this case is at an end.  There is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings.  Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551 (1987); Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989) (applying the rule to capital cases).  Consequently, a petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings.  See Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U. S. 586 (1982) (where there is no constitutional right to counsel there can be no deprivation of effective assistance).  Coleman contends that it was his attorney’s error that led to the late filing of his state habeas appeal.  This error cannot be constitutionally ineffective; therefore Coleman must “bear *753 the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.” Coleman attempts to avoid this reasoning by arguing that <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> does not stand for such a broad proposition.  He contends that <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> applies by its terms only in those situations where it is possible to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.  Where there is no constitutional right to counsel, Coleman argues, it is enough that a petitioner demonstrate that his attorney’s conduct would meet the Strickland standard, even though no independent Sixth Amendment claim is possible.  This argument is inconsistent not only with the language of <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> , but with the logic of that opinion as well.  We explained clearly that “cause” under the cause and prejudice test must be something external to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him: “[W]e think that the existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel’s efforts to comply with the State’s procedural rule.” 477 U. S., at 488.  For example, “a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel, ... or that ‘some interference by officials’ .  .  .  made compliance impracticable, would constitute cause under this standard.” Ibid. See also id., at 492 (“[Clause for a procedural default on appeal ordinarily requires a showing of some external impediment preventing counsel from constructing or raising the claim”).  Attorney ignorance or inadvertence is not “cause” because the attorney is the petitioner’s agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner must “bear the risk of attorney error.” Id., at 488.

 .  .  each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent”); Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (same).  Attor *754 ney error that constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel is cause, however.  This is not because, as Coleman contends, the error is so bad that “the lawyer ceases to be an agent of the petitioner.” Brief for Petitioner 29.  In a case such as this, where the alleged attorney error is inadvertence in failing to file a timely notice, such a rule would be contrary to well-settled principles of agency law. See, e. g., Restatement (Second) of Agency § 242 (1958) (master is subject to liability for harm caused by negligent conduct of servant within the scope of employment).  Rather, as <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> explains, “if the procedural default is the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Sixth Amendment itself requires that responsibility for the default be imputed to the State.” 477 U. S., at 488.  In other words, it is not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters, but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to counsel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor, i.  e., “imputed to the State.” See also Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 396 (1985) (“The constitutional mandate [guaranteeing effective assistance of counsel] is addressed to the action of the State in obtaining a criminal conviction through a procedure that fails to meet the standard of due process of law”).  Where a petitioner defaults a claim as a result of the denial of the right to effective assistance of counsel, the State, which is responsible for the denial as a constitutional matter, must bear the cost of any resulting default and the harm to state interests.that federal habeas review entails.  A different allocation of costs is appropriate in those circumstances where the State has no responsibility to ensure that the petitioner was represented by competent counsel.  As between the State and the petitioner, it is the petitioner who must bear- the burden of a failure to follow state procedural rules.  In the absence of a constitutional violation, the petitioner bears the risk in federal habeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the representation, as <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> says explicitly.  *755 B Among the claims Coleman brought in state habeas, and then again in federal habeas, is ineffective assistance of counsel during trial, sentencing, and appeal.  Coleman contends that, at least as to these claims, attorney error in state ha-beas must constitute cause.  This is because, under Virginia law at the time of Coleman’s trial and direct appeal, ineffective assistance of counsel claims related to counsel’s conduct during trial or appeal could be brought only in state habeas.  See Walker v. Mitchell, 224 Va. 568, 571 , 299 S. E. 2d 698, 699-700 (1983); Dowell v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 555, 562 , 351 S. E. 2d 915, 919 (1987).  Coleman argues that attorney error in failing to file timely in the first forum in which a federal claim can be raised is cause.  We reiterate that counsel’s ineffectiveness will constitute cause only if it is an independent constitutional violation.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice White, concurring. I concur in the judgment of the Court and I join in its opinion, but add a few words concerning what occurred below. Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255 (1989), stated that “a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case ‘ “clearly and expressly” ’ states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar. ” Id., at 263 , quoting Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 327 (1985), in turn quoting Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1983). If there were nothing before us but the order granting the State’s motion to dismiss for untimeliness, it would be clear enough that the dismissal was based on a procedural default. But the state court did not grant the State’s explicit request for an early ruling on the motion. Instead, the court delayed ruling on the motion to dismiss, and hence briefs on both the motion and the merits were filed. Six months later, the court “upon consideration whereof” granted the State’s motion to dismiss the appeal. Hence petitioner’s argument that the court studied the merits of the federal claims to determine whether to waive the procedural default, found those claims lacking, and only then granted the motion to dismiss; it is as though the court had said that it was granting the motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely because the federal *758 claims were untenable and provided the court no reason to waive the default. The predicate for this argument is that on occasion the Virginia Supreme Court waives the untimeliness rule. If that were true, the rule would not be an adequate and independent state ground barring direct or habeas review. Cf. Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75 (1985). The filing of briefs and their consideration would do no more than buttress the claim that the rule is not strictly enforced. Petitioner argues that the Virginia court does in fact waive the rule on occasion, but I am not now convinced that there is a practice of waiving the rule when constitutional issues are at stake, even fundamental ones. The evidence is too scanty to permit a conclusion that the rule is no longer an adequate and independent state ground barring federal review. The fact that merits briefs were filed and were considered by the court, without more, does not justify a different conclusion.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 I see no benefit in abandoning a clear rule to create chaos.  Ill Having abandoned the plain-statement rule with respect to a summary order, the majority must consider Coleman’s argument that the untimely filing of his notice of appeal was the result of attorney error of sufficient magnitude as to constitute cause for his procedural default.  In a sleight of logic that would be ironic if not for its tragic consequences, the majority concludes that a state prisoner pursuing state collateral relief must bear the risk of his attorney’s grave errors — even if the result of those errors is that the prisoner will be executed without having presented his federal claims to a federal court — because this attribution of risk represents the appropriate “allocation of costs.” Ante, at 754.  Whether unprofessional attorney conduct in a state postconviction proceeding should bar federal habeas review of a state prisoner’s *772 conviction and sentence of death is not a question of costs to be allocated most efficiently.  It is, rather, another circumstance where this Court must determine whether federal rights should yield to state interests.  In my view, the obligation of a federal habeas court to correct fundamental constitutional violations, particularly in capital cases, should not accede to the State’s “discretion to develop and implement programs to aid prisoners seeking to secure postconviction review.” Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 559 (1987).  The majority first contends that this Court’s decision in Murray v. <citedDecision>Carrier, 477 U. S. 478</citedDecision> (1986), expressly resolves this issue.  Of course, that cannot be so, as the procedural default at issue in <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> occurred on direct review, not collateral attack, and this Court has no authority to resolve issues not before it.  Moreover, notwithstanding the majority’s protestations to the contrary, the language of <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> strongly suggests that the Court’s resolution of the issue would have been the same regardless of when the procedural default occurred.  The Court in <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> explained: “A State’s procedural rules serve vital purposes at trial, on appeal, and on state collateral attack.” <citedDecision>477 U. S., at 490</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  Rejecting Carrier’s argument that, with respect to the standard for cause, procedural defaults on appeal should be treated differently from those that occur during the trial, the Court stated that “the standard for cause should not vary depending on the timing of a procedural default or on the strength of an uncertain and difficult assessment of the relative magnitude of the benefits attributable to the state procedural rules that attach at each successive stage of the judicial process.” Id., at 491 (emphasis added).  The rule foreshadowed by this language, which the majority today evades, most faithfully adheres to a principled view of the role of federal habeas jurisdiction.  As noted above, federal courts forgo the exercise of their habeas jurisprudence over claims that are procedurally barred out of respect for the state interests served by those rules.  Recognition of *773 state procedural forfeitures discourages petitioners from attempting to avoid state proceedings and accommodates the State’s interest in finality.  No rule, however, can deter gross incompetence.  To permit a procedural default caused by attorney error egregious enough to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel to preclude federal habeas review of a state prisoner’s federal claims in no way serves the State’s interest in preserving the integrity of its rules and proceedings.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Ante, at 755.  This Court has made clear that the Fourteenth Amendment obligates a State “‘to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State’s appellate process,’” Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S., at 556 , quoting Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 616 (1974), and “require[s] that the state appellate system be ‘free from unreasoned distinctions,’” id,., at 612.  While the State may have wide latitude to structure its appellate process as it deems most effective, it cannot, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, structure it in such a way as to deny indigent defendants meaningful access.  Accordingly, if a State desires to remove from the process of direct appellate review a claim or category of claims, the Fourteenth Amendment binds the State to ensure that the defendant has effective assistance of counsel for the entirety of the procedure *774 where the removed claims may be raised.  Similarly, fundamental fairness dictates that the State, having removed certain claims from the process of direct review, bear the burden of ineffective assistance of counsel in the proceeding to which the claim has been removed.  Ultimately, the Court’s determination that ineffective assistance of counsel cannot constitute cause of a procedural default in a state postconviction proceeding is patently unfair.  In concluding that it was not inequitable to apply the cause and prejudice standard to procedural defaults that occur on appeal, the <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> Court took comfort in the “additional safeguard against miscarriages of justice in criminal cases”: the right to effective assistance of counsel.  <citedDecision>477 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> .  The Court reasoned: “The presence of such a safeguard may properly inform this Court’s judgment in determining ‘[w]hat standards should govern the exercise of the habeas court’s equitable discretion’ with respect to procedurally defaulted claims.” Ibid,., quoting Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S., at 9 .  “[Fundamental fairness is the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984).  It is the quintessence of inequity that the Court today abandons that safeguard while continuing to embrace the cause and prejudice standard.  I dissent.

This is not because, as Coleman contends, the error is so bad that "the lawyer ceases to be an agent of the petitioner." Brief for Petitioner 29.  In a case such as this, where the alleged attorney error is inadvertence in failing to file a timely notice, such a rule would be contrary to well-settled principles of agency law. See, e. g., Restatement (Second) of Agency § 242 (1958) (master is subject to liability for harm caused by negligent conduct of servant within the scope of employment).  Rather, as <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> explains, "if the procedural default is the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Sixth Amendment itself requires that responsibility for the default be imputed to the State." 477 U. S., at 488.  In other words, it is not the gravity of the attorney's error that matters, but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner's right to counsel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor, i.  e., "imputed to the State." See also Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 396 (1985) ("The constitutional mandate [guaranteeing effective assistance of counsel] is addressed to the action of the State in obtaining a criminal conviction through a procedure that fails to meet the standard of due process of law").  Where a petitioner defaults a claim as a result of the denial of the right to effective assistance of counsel, the State, which is responsible for the denial as a constitutional matter, must bear the cost of any resulting default and the harm to state interests that federal habeas review entails.  A different allocation of costs is appropriate in those circumstances where the State has no responsibility to ensure that the petitioner was represented by competent counsel.  As between the State and the petitioner, it is the petitioner who must bear the burden of a failure to follow state procedural rules.  In the absence of a constitutional violation, the petitioner bears the risk in federal habeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the representation, as <citedDecision>Carrier</citedDecision> says explicitly.  *755 B Among the claims Coleman brought in state habeas, and then again in federal habeas, is ineffective assistance of counsel during trial, sentencing, and appeal.  Coleman contends that, at least as to these claims, attorney error in state habeas must constitute cause.  This is because, under Virginia law at the time of Coleman's trial and direct appeal, ineffective assistance of counsel claims related to counsel's conduct during trial or appeal could be brought only in state habeas.  See Walker v. Mitchell, 224 Va. 568, 571 , 299 S. E. 2d 698, 699-700 (1983); Dowell v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 555, 562 , 351 S. E. 2d 915, 919 (1987).  Coleman argues that attorney error in failing to file timely in the first forum in which a federal claim can be raised is cause.  We reiterate that counsel's ineffectiveness will constitute cause only if it is an independent constitutional violation.
**Combined Opinion**
 In a sleight of logic that would be ironic if not for its tragic consequences, the majority concludes that a state prisoner pursuing state collateral relief must bear the risk of his attorney's grave errorseven if the result of those errors is that the prisoner will be executed without having presented his federal claims to a federal court  because this attribution of risk represents the appropriate "allocation of costs." Ante, at 754.  Whether unprofessional attorney conduct in a state postconviction proceeding should bar federal habeas review of a state prisoner's *772 conviction and sentence of death is not a question of costs to be allocated most efficiently.  It is, rather, another circumstance where this Court must determine whether federal rights should yield to state interests.  In my view, the obligation of a federal habeas court to correct fundamental constitutional violations, particularly in capital cases, should not accede to the State's "discretion to develop and implement programs to aid prisoners seeking to secure postconviction review." Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 559 (1987).  The majority first contends that this Court's decision in Murray v. Carrier, <citedDecision>477 U. S. 478</citedDecision> (1986), expressly resolves this issue.  Of course, that cannot be so, as the procedural default at issue in Murray occurred on direct review, not collateral attack, and this Court has no authority to resolve issues not before it.  Moreover, notwithstanding the majority's protestations to the contrary, the language of Murray strongly suggests that the Court's resolution of the issue would have been the same regardless of when the procedural default occurred.  The Court in Murray explained: "A State's procedural rules serve vital purposes at trial, on appeal, and on state collateral attack.  " 477 U. S., at 490 (emphasis added).  Rejecting Carrier's argument that, with respect to the standard for cause, procedural defaults on appeal should be treated differently from those that occur during the trial, the Court stated that "the standard for cause should not vary depending on the timing of a procedural default or on the strength of an uncertain and difficult assessment of the relative magnitude of the benefits attributable to the state procedural rules that attach at each successive stage of the judicial process." Id., at 491 (emphasis added).
