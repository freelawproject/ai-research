**Dissenting Opinion**
 At the same time, the doctrine of municipal immunity enunciated in Monroe has protected municipalities and their limited treasuries from the consequences of their officials’ failure to predict the course of this Court’s constitutional jurisprudence.  None of the Members of this Court can foresee the practical consequences of today’s removal of that protection.  Only the Congress, which has the benefit of the advice of every segment of this diverse Nation, is equipped to consider the results of such a drastic change in the law. It seems all but inevitable that it will find it necessary to do so after today’s decision.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  As we pointed out in Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 278-279 (1977), the existence of a claim for relief under § 1983 is “jurisdictional” for purposes of invoking 28 U. S. C. § 1343 , even though the existence of a meritorious constitutional claim is not similarly required in order to invoke jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1331 .  See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946).  The other statutes cited by the Court, ante, at 697-699, n. 63, make no mention of § 1983, but refer generally to suits against “a local educational agency.” As noted by the Court of Appeals, <citedDecision>532 F. 2d 259, 264-266</citedDecision> , such suits may be maintained against board members in their official capacities *717 for injunctive relief under either § 1983 or Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908).  Congress did not stop to consider the technically proper avenue of relief, but merely responded to the fact that relief was being granted.  The practical result of choosing the avenue suggested by petitioners would be the subjection of school corporations to liability in damages.  Nothing in recent congressional history even remotely supports such a result.  I find it somewhat ironic that, in abandoning the supposedly ill-considered holding of Monroe , my Brother Powell relies heavily upon cases involving school boards, although he admits that “the exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction .  .  .
