**Combined Opinion**
[10] 254 U.S. 122 , 124. [11] Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U.S. 495 , 511. [12] The 14th Amendment, ยง 1, provides: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; . . ." [13] 307 U.S. 496 . The prior cases are collected in Note 2 of the dissenting opinion in Colgate v. Harvey ( 296 U.S. 404 , 445) and Note 1 of Mr. Justice Stone's opinion in the Hague case ( 307 U.S. 496 , 520). [14] Mr. Justice Roberts' opinion, at p. 512: "Although it has been held that the Fourteenth Amendment created no rights in citizens of the United States, but merely secured existing rights against state abridgement, it is clear that the right peaceably to assemble and to discuss these topics, and to communicate respecting them, whether orally or in writing, is a privilege inherent in citizenship of the United States which the Amendment protects." Mr. Justice Stone's opinion, at p. 519-21: "Hence there is no occasion . . . to revive the contention, rejected by this Court in the Slaughter-House Cases, that the privileges and immunities of United States citizenship, protected by that clause, extend beyond those which arise or grow out of the relationship of United States citizens to the national government. "That such is the limited application of the privileges and immunities clause seems now to be conceded by my brethren."
