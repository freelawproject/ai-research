 .  .  between mail-order sellers with [a physical presence in the taxing] State and those ... who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business.” We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval ever since.  For example, in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 263 (1989), we expressed “doubt that termination of an interstate telephone call, by itself, provides a substantial enough nexus for a State to tax a call. See National Bellas Hess .  .  .  (receipt of mail provides insufficient nexus).” See also D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, <citedDecision>486 U. S. 24, 33</citedDecision> (1988); Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S., at 437 ; National Geographic Society, 430 U. S., at 559 .  For these reasons, we disagree with the State Supreme Court’s conclu *312 sion that our decision in Complete Auto undercut the Bellas Hess rule.  The State of North Dakota relies less on Complete Auto and more on the evolution of our due process jurisprudence.  The State contends that the nexus requirements imposed by the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are equivalent and that if, as we concluded above, a mail-order house that lacks a physical presence in the taxing State nonetheless satisfies the due process “minimum contacts” test, then that corporation also meets the Commerce Clause “substantial nexus” test.  We disagree.  Despite the similarity in phrasing, the nexus requirements of the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are not identical.  The two standards are animated by different constitutional concerns and policies.

 As we shall explain, Quill’s interests in the licensed software does not affect our analysis of the due process issue and does not comprise the “substantial nexus” required by the Commerce Clause.  See n. 8, infra.  The court also suggested that, in view of the fact that the “touchstone of Due Process is fundamental fairness” and that the “very object” of the Commerce Clause is protection of interstate business against discriminatory local practices, it would be ironic to exempt Quill from this burden and thereby allow it to enjoy a significant competitive advantage over local retailers.  470 N. W. 2d, at 214-215 .  Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, 306 U. S. 62 (1939).  Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 312 U. S. 369 (1941).  Under our current Commerce Clause jurisprudence, “with certain restrictions, interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes.” D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, <citedDecision>486 U. S. 24, 31</citedDecision> (1988); see also Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 623-624 (1981) (“It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of [the] state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  North Dakota’s use tax illustrates well how a state tax might unduly burden interstate commerce.  On its face, North Dakota law imposes a collection duty on every vendor who advertises in the State three times in a single year.  Thus, absent the Bellas Hess rule, a publisher who included a subscription card in three issues of its magazine, a vendor whose radio advertisements were heard in North Dakota on three occasions, and a corporation whose telephone sales force made three calls into the State, all would be subject to the collection duty.  What is more significant, similar obligations might be imposed by the Nation’s 6,000-plus taxing jurisdictions.  See National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., 386 U. S. 753, 769-760 (1967) (noting that the “many variations in rates of tax, in allowable exemptions, and in administrative and record-keeping requirements could entangle [a mail-order house] in a virtual welter of complicated obligations”) (footnotes omitted); see also Shaviro, An Economic and Political Look at Federalism in Taxation, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 895 , 925-926 (1992).  We have sometimes stated that the “Complete Auto test, while responsive to Commerce Clause dictates, encompasses as well .
