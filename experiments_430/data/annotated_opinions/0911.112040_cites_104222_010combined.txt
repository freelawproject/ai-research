 We see no reason, however, why South Carolina cannot bring a facial challenge to § 310 rather than an as-applied challenge.  [10]  Income indirectly derived from a contract with the government was treated differently.  See, e. g., Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216, 227-230 (1931) (constitutional to tax capital gain on sale of state bond because State not a party to the sale contract); see also Greiner v. Lewellyn, 258 U. S. 384 (1922) (constitutional to tax transfer of estate even though state bonds are included in determining the value of the estate).  [11]  The sources of the state and federal immunities are, of course, different: the state immunity arises from the constitutional structure and a concern for protecting state sovereignty whereas the federal immunity arises from the Supremacy Clause.  The immunities have also differed somewhat in their underlying political theory and in their doctrinal contours.  Many of this Court's opinions have suggested that the Constitution should be interpreted to confer a greater tax immunity on the Federal Government than on States because all the people of the States are represented in the Federal Government whereas all the people of the Federal Government are not represented in individual States.  Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 412 (1938); McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 435-436 (1819); New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572, 577</citedDecision> , and n. 3 (1946) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  In fact, the federal tax immunity has always been greater than the States' immunity.  The Federal Government, for example, possesses the power to enact statutes immunizing those with whom it deals from state taxation even if intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine would not otherwise confer an immunity.  See, e. g., Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 478 (1939).  The States lack any such power.  Also, although the Federal Government has always enjoyed blanket immunity from any state tax considered to be "on" the Government under the prevailing methodology, the States have never enjoyed immunity from all federal taxes considered to be "on" a State.  See infra, at 523, and n. 14.
**Combined Opinion**
 [13]  South Carolina and the Government Finance Officers Association as amicus curiae argue that the legislative history of the Sixteenth Amendment, which authorizes Congress to "collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment," manifests an intent to freeze into the Constitution the tax immunity for state bond interest that existed in 1913.  We disagree.  The legislative history merely shows that the words "from whatever source derived" of the Sixteenth Amendment were not affirmatively intended to authorize Congress to tax state bond interest or to have any other effect on which incomes were subject to federal taxation, and that the sole purpose of the Sixteenth Amendment was to remove the apportionment requirement for whichever incomes were otherwise taxable.  45 Cong. Rec. 2245-2246 (1910); id., at 2539; see also Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 17-18 (1916).  Indeed, if the Sixteenth Amendment had frozen into the Constitution all the tax immunities that existed in 1913, then most of modern intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine would be invalid.  [14]  All federal activities are immune from direct state taxation, see Graves, 306 U. S., at 477 , but at least some state activities have always been subject to direct federal taxation.  For a time, only the States' governmental, as opposed to proprietary, activities enjoyed tax immunity, see e. g., Helvering v. Powers, 293 U. S. 214, 227 (1934); South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 454-463 (1905), but this distinction was subsequently abandoned as untenable by all eight Justices participating in New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572</citedDecision> (1946).  See <citedDecision>id., at 579-581, 583</citedDecision> (opinion of Frankfurter, J., joined by Rutledge, J.); <citedDecision>id., at 586</citedDecision> (Stone, C. J., concurring, joined by Reed, Murphy, and Burton, JJ.); <citedDecision>id., at 591</citedDecision> (Douglas, J., dissenting, joined by Black, J.).  Two Justices reasoned that any nondiscriminatory tax on a State was constitutional, even if directly collected from the State.  See <citedDecision>id., at 582-584</citedDecision> (Frankfurter, J., joined by Rutledge, J.).  Four other Justices declined to hold that every nondiscriminatory tax levied directly on a State would be constitutional because "there may be non-discriminatory taxes which, when laid on a State, would nevertheless impair the sovereign status of the State quite as much as a like tax imposed by a State on property or activities of the national government.  Mayo v. United States, 319 U. S. 441, 447-448 (1943).  This is not because the tax can be regarded as discriminatory but because a sovereign government is the taxpayer, and the tax, even though non-discriminatory, may be regarded as infringing its sovereignty." <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 587</citedDecision> (Stone, C. J., concurring, joined by Reed, Murphy, and Burton, JJ.) (emphasis added) (the cited discussion from Mayo stressed the difference between levying a tax on a government and on those with whom the government deals); see also <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 588</citedDecision> ("Only when and because the subject of taxation is State property or a State activity must we consider whether such a non-discriminatory tax unduly interferes with the performance of the State's functions of government").  The four Justices then concluded that the tax at issue was constitutional even though directly levied on the State because recognizing an immunity would "accomplish a withdrawal from the taxing power of the nation a subject of taxation of a nature which has been traditionally within that power from the beginning." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> We need not concern ourselves here, however, with the extent to which, if any, States are currently immune from direct federal taxation.  See n. 11, supra. For our purposes, the important principle <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> reaffirms is that the issue whether a nondiscriminatory federal tax might nonetheless violate state tax immunity does not even arise unless the Federal Government seeks to collect the tax directly from a State.  [15]  South Carolina distinguishes the taxes by arguing that the interest paid to a State's bondholders is more essential to the maintenance of a state government than the salaries paid to employees.  This strikes us as counterintuitive in fact.  More importantly, the essential/nonessential distinction it invokes is exactly the type of distinction we concluded was unworkable in Garcia, 469 U. S., at 542-547 (rejecting rules of state immunity turning on whether a governmental function is "essential," "governmental" versus "proprietary," "traditional," "uniquely governmental," "necessary," or "integral").  " `There is not, and there cannot be, any unchanging line of demarcation between essential and non-essential governmental functions.  Many governmental functions of today have at some time in the past been non-governmental.  The genius of our government provides that, within the sphere of constitutional action, the people  acting not through the courts but through their elected legislative representatives  have the power to determine as conditions demand, what services and functions the public welfare requires.'
