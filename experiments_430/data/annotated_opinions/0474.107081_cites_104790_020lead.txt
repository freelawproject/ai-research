 The dangerous consequences of this power are manifest.  If the legislature can disfranchise any number of citizens at pleasure by general descriptions, it may soon confine all the votes to a small number of partisans, and establish an aristocracy or an oligarchy; if it may banish at discretion all those whom particular circumstances render obnoxious, without hearing or trial, no man can be safe, nor know when he may be the innocent victim of a prevailing faction.  The name of liberty applied to such a government, would be a mockery of common sense.” 18 *445 Thus the Bill of Attainder Clause not only was intended as one implementation of the general principle of frac-tionalized power, but also reflected the Framers’ belief that the Legislative Branch is not so well suited as politically independent judges and juries to the task of ruling upon the blameworthiness of, and levying appropriate punishment upon, specific persons.  “Every one must concede that a legislative body, from its numbers and organization, and from the very intimate dependence of its members upon the people, which renders them, liable to be peculiarly susceptible to popular clamor, is not properly constituted to try with coolness, caution, and impartiality a criminal charge, especially in those cases in which the popular feeling is strongly excited, — the very class of cases most likely to be prosecuted by this mode.” 19 *446 By banning bills of attainder, the Framers of the Constitution sought to guard against such dangers by limiting legislatures to the task of rule-making.  “It is the peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government of society; the application of those rules to individuals in society would seem to be the duty of other departments.” Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136 .  20 *447 II.  It is in this spirit that the Bill of Attainder Clause was consistently interpreted by this Court — until the decision in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 382</citedDecision> , which we shall consider hereafter.  In 1810, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138 , stated that “[a] bill of attainder may affect the life of an individual, or may confiscate his property, or may do both.” This means, of course, that what were known at common law as bills of pains and penalties ar.e outlawed by the Bill of Attainder Clause.  The Court’s pronouncement therefore served notice that the Bill of Attainder Clause was not to be given a narrow historical reading (which would exclude bills of pains and penalties), but was instead to be read in light of the evil the Framers had sought to bar: legislative punishment, of any form or severity, of specifically designated persons or groups.  See also Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 286 .  The approach which Chief Justice Marshall had suggested was followed in the twin post-Civil War cases of Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277 , and Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333 .  Cummings involved the constitutionality of amendments to the Missouri Constitution of 1865 which provided that no one could engage in a number of specified professions (Cummings was a priest) unless he first swore that he had taken no part in the rebellion against the Union.  At issue in Garland was a federal statute which required attorneys to take a similar oath before they could practice in federal courts.

 It seems to us clear that § 32 establishes an objective standard of conduct.  Congress determined that a person who both (a) held a position in a bank which could be used to influence the investment policies of the bank or its customers, and (b) was in a position to benefit financially from investment in the securities handled by a particular underwriting house, might well be tempted to “use his influence in the bank to involve it or its customers in securities which his underwriting house has in its portfolio or has committed itself to take.” 329 U. S., at 447 .  In designating bank officers, directors and employees as those persons in position (a), and officers, directors, partners and employees of underwriting houses as those persons in position (b), Congress merely expressed the characteristics it was trying to reach in an alternative, shorthand way.  29 That Congress was legislating with *455 respect to general characteristics rather than with respect to a specific group of men is well demonstratecfby the fact that § 32 provides that the prescribed disqualification should not obtain whenever the Board of Governors determined that “it would not unduly influence the investment policies of such member bank or the advice it gives its customers regarding investments.” We do not suggest that such an escape clause is essential to the constitutionality of § 32, but point to it only further to underscore the infirmity of the suggestion that § 32, like § 504, incorporates an empirical judgment of, and inflicts its deprivation upon, a particular group of men.  It is argued, however, that in § 504 Congress did no more than it did in enacting § 32: it promulgated a general rule to the effect that persons possessing characteristics which make them likely to incite political strikes should not hold union office, and simply inserted in place of a list of those characteristics an alternative, shorthand criterion — membership in the Communist Party.  Again, we cannot agree.  The designation of Communists as those persons likely to cause political strikes is not the substitution of a semantically equivalent phrase; on the contrary, it rests, as the Court in <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> explicitly recognized, <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 389</citedDecision> , upon an empirical investigation by Congress of the acts, characteristics and propensities of Communist Party members.  In a number of decisions, this Court has pointed out the fallacy of the suggestion that membership in the Communist Party, or any other political organization, can be regarded as an alternative, but equivalent, expression for a list of undesirable characteristics.  For, as the Court noted in Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U. S. 118, 136 , “under our traditions beliefs are personal and not a matter of mere association, and .  .  .  men in adhering to a political party or other organization notoriously do not subscribe un- *456 qualifiedly to all of its platforms or asserted principles.” 30 Just last Term, in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500 , we held § 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act to violate the Constitution because it “too broadly and indiscriminately” restricted constitutionally protected freedoms.  One of the factors which compelled us to reach this conclusion was that § 6 inflicted its deprivation upon all members of Communist organizations without regard to whether there existed any demonstrable relationship between the characteristics of the person involved and the evil Congress sought to eliminate.  Id., at 509-511.  These cases are relevant to the question before us.  Even assuming that Congress had reason to conclude that some Communists would use union positions to bring about political strikes, “it cannot automatically be inferred that all members shar[e] their evil purposes or participate] in their illegal conduct.” Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232, 246 .  In utilizing the term “members of the Communist Party” to designate those persons who are likely to incite political strikes, it plainly is not the case that Congress has merely substituted a convenient shorthand term for a list of the characteristics it was trying to reach.  31 IV. The Solicitor General argues that § 504 is not a bill of attainder because the prohibition it imposes does not constitute “punishment.” In support of this conclusion, he urges that the statute was enacted for preventive rather *457 than retributive reasons — that its aim is not to punish Communists for what they have done in the past, but rather to keep them from positions where they will in the future be able to bring about undesirable events.  He relies on American Communications Assn. v. Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 382</citedDecision> , which upheld § 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, the predecessor of the statute presently before us.  In <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> the Court distinguished Cummings, Garland and Lovett on the ground that in those cases “the individuals involved were in fact being punished for past actions; whereas in this case they are subject to possible loss of position only because there is substantial ground for the congressional judgment that their beliefs and loyalties will be transformed into future conduct.” Id., at 413 .  This case is not necessarily controlled by <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> .  For to prove its assertion that § 9 (h) was preventive rather than retributive in purpose, 32 the Court in <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> focused *458 on the fact that members of the Communist Party could escape from the class of persons specified by Congress simply by resigning from the Party: “Here the intention is to forestall future dangerous acts; there is no one who may not, by a voluntary alteration of the loyalties which impel him to action, become eligible to sign the affidavit.  We cannot conclude that this section is a bill of attainder.” <citedDecision>Id., at 414</citedDecision> .  Section 504, unlike § 9 (h), disqualifies from the holding of union office not only present members of the Communist Party, but also anyone who has within the past five years been a member of the Party.  However, even if we make the assumption that the five-year provision was inserted not out of desire to visit retribution but purely out of a belief that failure to include it would lead to pro forma resignations from the Party which would not decrease the threat of political strikes, it still clearly appears that § 504 inflicts “punishment” within the meaning of the Bill of Attainder Clause.  It would be archaic to limit the definition of “punishment” to “retribution.” Punishment serves several purposes: retributive, rehabilitative, deterrent — and preventive.  One of the reasons society imprisons those convicted of crimes is to keep them from inflicting future harm, but that does not make imprisonment any the less punishment.  Historical considerations by no means compel restriction of the bill of attainder ban to instances of retribution.  A number of English bills of attainder were enacted for preventive purposes — that is, the legislature made a judgment, undoubtedly based largely on past acts and associations (as § 504 is) 33 that a given person or group was likely to cause trouble (usually, overthrow the *459 government) and therefore inflicted deprivations upon that person or group in order to keep it from bringing about the feared event.  34 It is also clear that many of the early American bills attainting the Tories were passed in order to impede their effectively resisting the Revolution.  “In the progress of the conflict, and particularly in its earliest periods, attainder and confiscation had been resorted to generally, throughout the continent, as a means of war.  But it is a fact important to the history of the revolting colonies, that the acts prescribing penalties, usually offered to the persons against whom they were directed the option of avoiding them, by acknowledging their allegiance to the existing governments.  “It was a preventive, not a vindictive policy.  In the same humane spirit, as the contest approached its close, and the necessity of these severities diminished, many of the states passed laws offering pardons *460 to those who had been disfranchised, and restoring them to the enjoyment of their property .. ..” 35 Thus Justice Iredell was on solid historical ground when he observed, in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 399-400 , that “attainders, on the principle of retaliation and proscription„ have marked all the vicissitudes of party triumph.” (Emphasis supplied.) We think that the Court in <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> misread United States v. Lovett when it suggested, <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 413</citedDecision> , that that case could be distinguished on the ground that the sanction there imposed was levied for purely retributive reasons.  In Lovett the Court, after reviewing the legislative history of § 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, 328 U. S., at 308-313 , concluded that the statute was the product of a congressional drive to oust from government persons whose (congressionally determined) “subversive” tendencies made their continued employment dangerous to the national welfare: “the purpose of all who sponsored § 304 .  .  .  clearly was to ‘purge’ the then existing and all future lists of government employees of those whom Congress deemed guilty of ‘subversive activities’ and therefore ‘unfit’ to hold a federal job.” Id., at 314.  Similarly, the purpose of the statute before us is to purge the governing boards of labor unions of' those whom Congress regards as guilty of subversive acts and associations and therefore unfit to fill positions which might affect interstate commerce.  36 *461 The Solicitor General urges us to distinguish Lovett on the ground that the statute struck down there “singled out three identified individuals.” It is of course true that § 504 does not contain the words “Archie Brown,” and that-it inflicts its deprivation upon more than three people.

 Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of the courts of justice; whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void.  Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.” 40 The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.  73 Stat. 536 , 29 U. S. C. §504 (1958 ed., Supp. IV).  The section, which took effect on September 14,1959, provides, in pertinent part: “(a) No person who is or has been a member of the Communist Party .  .  .  shall serve— “(1) as an officer, director, trustee, member of any executive board or similar governing body, business agent, manager, organizer, or other *439 employee (other than as an employee performing exclusively clerical or custodial duties) of any labor organization .... “during or for five years after the termination of his membership in the Communist Party .... “ (b) Any person who willfully violates this section shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.” In American Communications Assn. v. Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 382, 388</citedDecision> , this Court found that “the purpose of § 9 (h) of the [National Labor Relations] Act [was] to remove .  .  .  the so-called 'political strike’.” Section 504 was designed to accomplish the same purpose as § 9 (h), but in a more direct and effective way.  H. R. Rep. No. 741, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 33; H. R. Rep. No. 1147, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 36.  61 Stat. 146 , amending the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 449 .  Section 9 (h) provided: “No investigation shall be made by the Board of any question affecting commerce concerning the representation of employees, raised by a labor organization under subsection (c) of this section, no petition under section 9 (e)(1) shall be entertained, and no complaint shall be issued pursuant to a charge made by a labor organization under subsection (b) of section 10, unless there is on file with the Board an affidavit executed contemporaneously or within the preceding twelve-month period by each officer of such labor organization and the officers of any national or international labor organization of which it is an affiliate or constituent unit that he is not a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such party, and that he does not believe in, and is not a member of or supports any organization that believes in or teaches, the overthrow of the United States Government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods.

 The command of the Bill of Attainder Clause — that a legislature can provide that persons possessing certain characteristics must abstain from certain activities, but must leave to other tribunals the task of deciding who possesses those characteristics — does not mean that a legislature cannot use a shorthand phrase to summarize the characteristics with which it is concerned.  For example, a legislature might deterniine that persons afflicted with a certain disease which has as one of its symptoms a susceptibility to uncontrollable seizures should not be licensed to operate dangerous machinery.  In enacting a statute to achieve this goal, the legislature could name the disease instead of listing the symptoms, for in doing so it would merely be substituting a shorthand phrase which conveys the same meaning.  To the same effect, see Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 299-300 ; Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 190 .  We rely on the “overbroadness” cases only to buttress our conclusion that § 604 cannot be rationalized on the ground-that membership in the Communist Party is merely an equivalent, shorthand way of expressing those characteristics which render likely the incitement of political strikes.  We of course do not hold that overbroadness is a necessary characteristic of a bill of attainder.  The Court’s opinion in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U. S. 1, 88 , also referred to the fact that the members of the class affected by the statute could extricate themselves from the class at will. However, whereas the factor of escapability was considered in <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> to be probative of whether or not the statute was punitive, in the Communist Party case it was considered only as one factor tending to show that the Act in question was not directed at a specific group of persons but rather set forth a generally applicable definition.  See note 26, supra. We do not read either opinion to have set up inescapability as an absolute prerequisite to a finding of attainder.  Such an absolute rule would have flown in the face of explicit precedent, Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 324 , as well as the historical background of the constitutional prohibition.  A number of ante-Constitution bills of attainder inflicted their deprivations upon named or described persons or groups, but offered them the option of avoiding the deprivations, e. g., by swearing allegiance to the existing government.  See, e. g., Del. Laws 1778, c. 29b; Mass. Acts of September 1778, c. 13; III Hamilton, History of the Republic of the United States, p. 25 (1859); see generally Note, 72 Yale L. J. 330, 339-340.  American Communications Assn. v. Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 382, 389</citedDecision> ; see note 2, supra. See Ex parte Law, 15 Fed. Cas. 3, 9-10 (No. 8126) (D. C. S. D. Ga. 1866).  Professor Chafee has pointed out that even the death penalty was often inflicted largely for preventive purposes: “There was no good middle ground between beheading and doing nothing.  If the ousted adviser were left at liberty, he could readily turn his resentment into coercion or rebellion and make a magnificent comeback to the utter ruin of those who had driven him from his high place.  Therefore, the usual object of Parliamentary proceedings against an important minister was to put him to death.” Chafee, Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787, pp. 103-104 (1956).  The preventive purpose of the “Act for the Attainder of the pretended Prince of Wales of High Treason” of 1700, 13 Will. 3 , c. 3, is demonstrated by the parliamentary declaration that anyone corresponding with the Prince or his followers would be subject to prosecution for treason.  See also Chafee, supra, pp. 109-113 (impeachment and attainder of the Earl of Strafford), 115-118 (bill against the Earl of Clarendon).  III Hamilton, History of the Republic of the United States, p. 25 (1859); see, e. g., Mass. Acts of September 1778, c. 13 (“An Act to Prevent the Return of Tories”); cf. Md. Laws February 1777, c. 20 (“An Act to punish certain crimes and misdemeanors, and to prevent the growth of toryism”); see also II Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, p. 211, n. 1 (4th ed. 1873); authorities cited note 15, supra. Nor do the deprivations imposed by the two statutes differ in any meaningful way.
