**Lead Opinion**
 The single rationally conceivable issue in dispute before the jury was whether the petitioner had been one of the robbers.  And the jury by its verdict found that he had not.  The federal rule of law, therefore, would make a second prosecution for the robbery of Roberts wholly impermissible.  The ultimate question to be determined, then, in the light of Benton v. Maryland, supra, is whether this established rule of federal law is embodied in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy.  We do not hesitate to hold that it is.  10 For whatever else that *446 constitutional guarantee may embrace, North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 , it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to “run the gantlet” a second time.  Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 190</citedDecision> .  The question is not whether Missouri could validly charge the petitioner with six separate offenses for the robbery of the six poker players.  It is not whether he could have received a total of six punishments if he had been convicted in a single trial of robbing the six victims.  It is simply whether, after a jury determined by its verdict that the petitioner was not one of the robbers, the State could constitutionally hale him before a new jury to litigate that issue again.  After the first jury had acquitted the petitioner of robbing Knight, Missouri could certainly not have brought him to trial again upon that charge.  Once a jury had determined upon conflicting testimony that there was at least a reasonable doubt that the petitioner was one of the robbers, the State could not present the same or different identification evidence in a second prosecution for the robbery of Knight in the hope that a different jury might find that evidence more convincing.  The situation is constitutionally no different here, even though the second trial related to another victim of the same robbery.
