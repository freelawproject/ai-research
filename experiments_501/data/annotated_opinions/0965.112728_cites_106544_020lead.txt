 He also contended that he did not understand the purposes of the plea form or the plea hearing.  He contended that he did not know he was pleading no contest to manslaughter, but rather that he thought he was agreeing to be tried for manslaughter.  *4 After a hearing, the state court dismissed respondent’s petition, finding that respondent was properly served by his trial interpreter arid that the interpreter correctly, fully, and accurately translated the communications between respondent and his attorney.  App. 51.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, and the State Supreme Court denied review.  Respondent then entered Federal District Court seeking a writ of habeas corpus.  Respondent contended that the material facts concerning the translation were not adequately developed at the state-court hearing, implicating the fifth circumstance of Townsend v. Sain, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 293, 313</citedDecision> (1963), and sought a federal evidentiary hearing on whether his nolo contendere plea was unconstitutional.  The District Court found that the failure to develop the critical facts relevant to his federal claim was attributable to inexcusable neglect and that no evidentiary hearing was required.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 37, 38.  Respondent appealed.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recognized that the alleged failure to translate the mens rea element of first-degree manslaughter, if proved, would be a basis for overturning respondent’s plea, 926 F. 2d 1492, 1494 (1991), and determined that material facts had not been adequately developed in the state postconviction court, id., at 1500 , apparently due to the negligence of postconviction counsel.  The court held that <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Sain, supra, at 317</citedDecision> , and Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438 (1963), required an evidentiary hearing in the District Court unless respondent had deliberately bypassed the orderly procedure of the state courts.  Because counsel’s negligent failure to develop the facts did not constitute a deliberate bypass, the Court of Appeals ruled that respondent was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the question whether the mens rea element of first-degree manslaughter was properly explained to him.  926 F. 2d, at 1502 .  1 *5 We granted certiorari to decide whether the deliberate bypass standard is the correct standard for excusing a habeas petitioner’s failure to develop a material fact in state-court proceedings.  502 U. S. 807 (1991).  We reverse.  Because the holding of <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Sain</citedDecision> that Fay v. Noia’s deliberate bypass standard is applicable in a case like this had not been reversed, it is quite understandable that the Court of Appeals applied that standard in this case. However, in light of more recent decisions of this Court, Townsend’s holding in this respect must be overruled.  2 Fay v. *6 Noia was itself a case where the habeas petitioner had not taken advantage of state remedies by failing to appeal — a procedural default case. Since that time, however, this Court has rejected the deliberate bypass standard in state procedural default cases and has applied instead a standard of cause and prejudice.  In Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), we acknowledged a federal court’s power to entertain an application for habeas even where the claim has been procedurally waived in state proceedings, but nonetheless examined the appropriateness of the exercise of that power and recognized, as we had in Fay , that considerations of comity and concerns for the orderly administration of criminal justice may in some circumstances require a federal court to forgo the exercise of its habeas corpus power.  425 U. S., at 538-539 .  We held that a federal habeas petitioner is required to show cause for his procedural default, as well as actual prejudice.  Id., at 542 .  In Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), we rejected the application of Fay’s standard of “knowing waiver” or “deliberate bypass” to excuse a petitioner’s failure to comply with a state contemporaneous-objection rule, stating that the state rule deserved more respect than the Fay standard accorded it.

 The State concedes that a remand to the District Court is appropriate in order to afford respondent the opportunity to bring forward evidence establishing cause and prejudice, Brief for Petitioner 21, and we agree that respondent should have that opportunity.  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  So ordered.  With respect to respondent’s claim that the plea form and plea proceeding were not adequately translated, the Court of Appeals concluded that state postconviction proceedings afforded petitioner ample opportunity to *5 contest the translations, that the material facts surrounding these issues were adequately developed, and that the state court’s findings were adequately supported by the record.  The Court of Appeals therefore held that a federal evidentiary hearing on that claim was not required.  926 F. 2d, at 1602 .  Justice O’Connor asserts that Townsend v. Sain, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 293</citedDecision> (1963), insofar as relevant to this case, merely reflected existing law. The claim thus seems to be that the general rule stated by the Court in <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> governing when an evidentiary hearing must be granted to a federal habeas corpus petitioner, as well as each of the Court’s six criteria particularizing its general pronouncement, reflected what was to be found in prior holdings of the Court. This is a very doubtful claim.  Surely the Court at that time did not think this was the case, for it pointedly observed that prior cases had not settled all aspects of the hearing problem in habeas proceedings and that the lower federal courts had reached widely divergent and irreconcilable results in dealing with hearing issues.  <citedDecision>Id., at 310</citedDecision> , and n. 8.  Hence it deemed it advisable to give further guidance to the lower courts.  It also expressly stated that the rules it was announcing “must be considered to supersede, to the extent of any inconsistencies, the opinions in Brown v. Allen[, 344 U. S. 443 (1953)].” Id., at 312.  This was necessary because Brown was inconsistent with the holding of <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> regarding habeas petitioners who failed to adequately develop federal claims in state-court proceedings.  See Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 465 (1953) (federal court may deny writ without rehearing of facts “where the legality of [the] detention has been determined, on the facts presented,” by the state court) (emphasis added); id., at 463 (writ should be refused, without more, if federal court satisfied from the record that “state process has given fair consideration to the issues and the offered evidence”) (emphasis added).  We have unequivocally acknowledged that <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> substantially changed the availability of evidentiary hearings in federal *6 habeas proceedings.  See Smith v. Yeager, 393 U. S. 122, 125 (1968) (per curiam).  It is not surprising, then, that none of the cases cited by Justice O’Con-nor remotely support Townsend’s requirement for a hearing in any case where the “material facts were not adequately developed at the state-court hearing” due to petitioner’s own neglect.  372 U. S., at 313.  Finally, it is undeniable that Fay v. Noia’s deliberate bypass standard overruled prior procedural default cases, and it is no less true that Townsend’s adoption of that standard as a definition of “inexcusable neglect” made new law. Justice O’Connor puts aside our overruling of Fay v. Noia’s standard in procedural default cases on the ground that in those cases the cause- and-prejudice standard is just an acceptable precondition to reaching the merits of a habeas petitioner’s claim, but insists that applying that standard to cases in which the petitioner defaulted on the development of a claim is not subject to the same characterization.  For the reasons stated in the text, we disagree.  Moreover, Justice O’Connor’s position is considerably weakened by her concession that the cause-and-prejudice standard is properly applied to a factually undeveloped claim which had been exhausted but which is first asserted federally in a second or later ha-beas petition.  Contrary to Justice O’Connor’s view, post, at 17, we think it clear that the <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> Court thought that the same standard used to deny a hearing in a procedural default ease should be used to deny a hearing in cases described in its fifth circumstance.  It is difficult to conceive any other reason for our borrowing the deliberate bypass standard of Fay v. Noia , particularly if, as the dissent seems to say, post, at 17, <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> relied on, but did not repeat, the analysis found in Fay v. Noia .  Yet the dissent insists that the rejection of Fay v. Noia’s analysis in our later cases should have no impact on a case such as we have before us now.  “An application for a writ of habeas corpus .  .  .  shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State .  ..28 U. S. C. § 2254 (b).  It is asserted by Justice O’Connor that in adopting 28 U. S. C. § 2254 (d) Congress assumed the continuing validity of all aspects of <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> , including the requirement of a hearing in all fifth circumstance cases absent a deliberate bypass.  For several reasons, we disagree.  First, it is evident that § 2254(d) does not codify Townsend’s specifications of when a hearing is required.  <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> described categories of cases in which evidentiary hearings would be required.  Section 2254(d), however, does not purport to govern the question of when hearings are required; rather, it lists exceptions to the normal presumption of correctness of state-court *11 findings and deals with the burden of proof where hearings are held.  The two issues are distinct, and the statute indicates no assumption that the presence or absence of any of the statutory exceptions will determine whether a hearing is held.  Second, to the extent that it even considered the issue of default, Congress sensibly could have read <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> as holding that the federal habeas corpus standard for cases of default under Townsend’s fifth circumstance and cases of procedural default should be the same.  Third, § 2254(d) does not mention or recognize any exception for inexcusable neglect, let alone reflect the specific standard of deliberate bypass.  In the face of this silence, it should not be assumed that if there is to be a judicially created standard for equitable default, it must be no other than the deliberate bypass standard borrowed by <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> from a decision that has since been repudiated.  We agree with Justice O’Connor that under our holding a claim invoking the fifth circumstance of <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> will be unavailing where the cause asserted is attorney error.  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986), and Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), dictate as much.  Such was the intended effect of those cases, but this does not make that circumstance a dead letter, for cause may be shown for reasons other than attorney error.  We noted in Murray , a procedural default case, that objective factors external to the defense may impede counsel’s efforts to comply and went on to say: “Without attempting an exhaustive catalog of such objective impediments to compliance with a procedural rule, we note that a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel, see Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S., at 16 , or that ‘some interference by officials,’ Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 486 (1953), made compliance impracticable, would constitute cause under this standard.” 477 U. S., at 488 .  Much of the same may be said of cases where the petitioner has defaulted on the development of a claim.  Nor, to the extent it is relevant to our decision in this case, is Justice O’Connor’s argument that many forms of cause would fall under other <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> circumstances persuasive.  For example, the third and sixth circumstances of <citedDecision>Townsend</citedDecision> speak to the denial by a court of full and fair hearing; however, a situation where facts were inadequately developed because of interference from officials would fall naturally into the fifth circumstance.
