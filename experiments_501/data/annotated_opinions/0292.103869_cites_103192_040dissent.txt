**Dissenting Opinion**
 The fact that these Indians are citizens is not inconsistent with their restricted status or the exercise of federal supervision over them.  See Board of Commissioners v. deber, supra; Glenn v. Lewis, 105 F. 2d 398 .  See Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567 ; Act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861 ; Act of June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 500 ; ยง 19 of Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; ยง 4 of Act of May 10,1928, 45 Stat. 495 and 733.  The fact that the exemptions do not mention inheritance or estate taxes is unimportant.  As pointed out before, contrary to the general rule Indian tax exemptions are to be liberally construed.  See Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363, 366-67 .  For that reason decisions, such as U. S. Trust Co. v. Helvering, <citedDecision>307 U. S. 57</citedDecision> , that statutory exemptions from taxation do not include an exemption from estate taxes, have no application here.  In addition to the statutes cited in Note 2, supra, see also Act of May 27,1908, 35 Stat. 312 ; and Act of January 27, 1933, 47 Stat. 777 .  See Note 12, infra.  See Note 12, infra.  Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts of July 22, 1790, 1 Stat. 137 ; March 1,1793, 1 Stat. 329 ; March 3,1799, ยง 12, 1 Stat. 743,25 U. S. C. ยง177.  See Treaty of March 21,1866, 14 Stat. 755 ; Treaty of June 14,1866, 14 Stat. 785 ; Curtis Act of 1898, 30 Stat. 495 ; Act of July 1,1898, 30 Stat. 567 ; Act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861 ; Act of June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 500 .  The President was authorized to extend the trust period in his discretion.
