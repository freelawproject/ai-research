 The United States Attorney's Office later obtained an indictment charging Foster with simple assault on or about November 6, 1987 (Count I, violation of § 22-504); threatening to injure another on or about November 12, 1987, and March 26 and May 17, 1988 (Counts IIIV, violation of § 22 2307); and assault with intent to kill on or about May 21, 1988 (Count V, violation of § 22-501).  App. 43-44.  Ana Foster was the complainant in all counts; the first and last counts were based on the events for which Foster had been held in contempt, and the other three were based on the alleged events for which Foster was acquitted of contempt.  Like Dixon, Foster filed a motion to dismiss, claiming a double jeopardy bar to all counts, and also collateral estoppel as to Counts IIIV.  The trial court denied the double jeopardy claim and did not rule on the collateral-estoppel assertion.  The Government appealed the double jeopardy ruling in Dixon, and Foster appealed the trial court's denial of his motion.  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals consolidated *694 the two cases, reheard them en banc, and, relying on our recent decision in Grady v. Corbin, <citedDecision>495 U. S. 508</citedDecision> (1990), ruled that both subsequent prosecutions were barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  598 A. 2d, at 725 .  In its petition for certiorari, the Government presented the sole question "[w]hether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution of a defendant on substantive criminal charges based upon the same conduct for which he previously has been held in criminal contempt of court." Pet. for Cert. I.  We granted certiorari, 503 U. S. 1004 (1992).  II To place these cases in context, one must understand that they are the consequence of a historically anomalous use of the contempt power.  In both Dixon and Foster, a court issued an order directing a particular individual not to commit criminal offenses.  (In Dixon's case, the court incorporated the entire criminal code; in Foster's case, the criminal offense of simple assault.)

 We think it obvious, and today hold, that the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause likewise attaches.  Accord, Menna v. New York, 423 U. S. 61 (1975) (per curiam) ; Colombo v. New York, 405 U. S. 9 (1972) (per curiam) .  In both the multiple punishment and multiple prosecution contexts, this Court has concluded that where the two offenses for which the defendant is punished or tried cannot survive the "same-elements" test, the double jeopardy bar applies.  See, e. g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 168-169 (1977); Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932) (multiple punishment); Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S. 338, 342 (1911) (successive prosecutions).  The sameelements test, sometimes referred to as the " Blockburger " test, inquires whether each offense contains an element not contained in the other; if not, they are the "same offence" and double jeopardy bars additional punishment and successive prosecution.  In a case such as Yancy , for example, in which *697 the contempt prosecution was for disruption of judicial business, the same-elements test would not bar subsequent prosecution for the criminal assault that was part of the disruption, because the contempt offense did not require the element of criminal conduct, and the criminal offense did not require the element of disrupting judicial business.  [1] We recently held in <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> that in addition to passing the Blockburger test, a subsequent prosecution must satisfy a "same-conduct" test to avoid the double jeopardy bar.  The <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> test provides that, "if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted," a second prosecution may not be had.  <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 510</citedDecision> .  III A The first question before us today is whether Blockburger analysis permits subsequent prosecution in this new criminal contempt context, where judicial order has prohibited criminal act.  If it does, we must then proceed to consider whether <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> also permits it.  See <citedDecision>Grady, supra, at 516</citedDecision> .  We begin with Dixon.  The statute applicable in Dixon's contempt prosecution provides that "[a] person who has been conditionally released .  .  .  and who has violated a condition of release shall be subject to .  .

 These charged Foster under § 22-2307 (forbidding anyone to "threate[n] .  .  .  to kidnap any person or to injure the person of another or physically damage the property of any person") for his alleged threats on three separate dates.  Foster's contempt prosecution included charges that, on the same dates, he violated the CPO provision ordering that he not "in any manner threaten" Ana Foster.  Conviction of the contempt required willful violation of the CPO which conviction under § 22-2307 did not; and conviction under § 22-2307 required that the threat be a threat to kidnap, to inflict bodily injury, or to damage propertywhich conviction of the contempt (for violating the CPO provision that Foster not "in any manner threaten") did not.  [8] Each *703 offense therefore contained a separate element, and the Blockburger test for double jeopardy was not met. IV Having found that at least some of the counts at issue here are not barred by the Blockburger test, we must consider whether they are barred by the new, additional double jeopardy test we announced three Terms ago in <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Corbin</citedDecision> .  [9] They undoubtedly are, since <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> prohibits "a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution [here, assault as an element of assault with intent to kill, or threatening as an element of threatening bodily injury], the government will *704 prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted [here, the assault and the threatening, which conduct constituted the offense of violating the CPO]." <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 510</citedDecision> .  We have concluded, however, that <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> must be overruled.  Unlike Blockburger analysis, whose definition of what prevents two crimes from being the "same offence," U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, has deep historical roots and has been accepted in numerous precedents of this Court, <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> lacks constitutional roots.  The "same-conduct" rule it announced is wholly inconsistent with earlier Supreme Court precedent and with the clear common-law understanding of double jeopardy.  See, e. g., Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S., at 345 (in subsequent prosecution, "[w]hile it is true that the conduct of the accused was one and the same, two offenses resulted, each of which had an element not embraced in the other").  We need not discuss the many proofs of these statements, which were set forth at length in the <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> dissent.  See <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 526</citedDecision> (opinion of Scalia, J.).  We will respond, however, to the contrary contentions of today's pro <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> dissents.  The centerpiece of Justice Souter's analysis is an appealing theory of a "successive prosecution" strand of the Double Jeopardy Clause that has a different meaning from its supposed "successive punishment" strand.  We have often noted that the Clause serves the function of preventing both successive punishment and successive prosecution, see, e. g., North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), but there is no authority, except <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , for the proposition that it has different meanings in the two contexts.  That is perhaps because it is embarrassing to assert that the single term "same offence" (the words of the Fifth Amendment at issue here) has two different meaningsthat what is the same offense is yet not the same offense.  Justice Souter provides no authority whatsoever (and we are aware of none) for the bald assertion that "we have long held that [the government] *705 must sometimes bring its prosecutions for [separate] offenses together." Post, at 747.  The collateral-estoppel effect attributed to the Double Jeopardy Clause, see Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), may bar a later prosecution for a separate offense where the Government has lost an earlier prosecution involving the same facts.  But this does not establish that the Government "must .  .

 .  cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents.' " 433 U. S., at 682-683 , quoting from 131 U. S., at 188 .  It is clear from that context that Harris regarded "incidents included" to mean "offenses included"a reference to defined crimes rather than to conduct.  Finally, Justice Souter misdescribes Vitale .  Despite his bold assertion to the contrary, see post, at 757, Vitale unquestionably reads Harris as merely an application of the double jeopardy bar to lesser and greater included offenses.  [11] Justice Souter instead elevates the statement in Vitale that, on certain hypothetical facts, the petitioner would have a "substantial" "claim" of double jeopardy on a <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> -type theory, see post, at 756-757, into a holding that the petitioner would win on that theory.  Post, at 757, 763.  No Justice, the Vitale dissenters included, has ever construed this passage as answering, rather than simply raising, the question on which we later granted certiorari in <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> .  See 447 U. S., at 426 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (in addition to finding the same-conduct claim "substantial," dissent would find it "dispositive").  See also Grady, <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 510</citedDecision> ( Vitale "suggested" same-conduct test adopted in <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> ).  In contrast to the above-discussed dicta relied upon by Justice Souter, there are two pre- <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> ( and post Nielsen ) cases that are directly on point.  In both Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S., at 343 , and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), the Court upheld subsequent *708 prosecutions after concluding that the Blockburger test (and only the Blockburger test) was satisfied.  [12] These cases are incompatible with the belief that Nielsen had created an additional requirement beyond the "elements" standard.  [13] Totally ignored by Justice Souter are the *709 many early American cases construing the Double Jeopardy Clause, which support only an "elements" test.  See <citedDecision>Grady, supra, at 533-535</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., dissenting).  [14] But <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> was not only wrong in principle; it has already proved unstable in application.  Less than two years after it came down, in United States v. Felix, 503 U. S. 378 (1992), we were forced to recognize a large exception to it.  There we concluded that a subsequent prosecution for conspiracy to manufacture, possess, and distribute methamphetamine was not barred by a previous conviction for attempt to manufacture the same substance.  We offered as a justification for avoiding a "literal" ( i.  e., faithful) reading of <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> "longstanding authority" to the effect that prosecution for conspiracy is not precluded by prior prosecution for the substantive offense.  Felix, supra, at 388-391 .  Of course the very existence of such a large and longstanding "exception" to the *710 <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> rule gave cause for concern that the rule was not an accurate expression of the law. This "past practice" excuse is not available to support the ignoring of <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> in the present case, since there is no Supreme Court precedent even discussing this fairly new breed of successive prosecution (criminal contempt for violation of a court order prohibiting a crime, followed by prosecution for the crime itself).  A hypothetical based on the facts in Harris reinforces the conclusion that <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> is a continuing source of confusion and must be overruled.  Suppose the State first tries the defendant for felony murder, based on robbery, and then indicts the defendant for robbery with a firearm in the same incident.  Absent <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , our cases provide a clear answer to the double jeopardy claim in this situation.  Under Blockburger , the second prosecution is not barredas it clearly was not barred at common law, as a famous case establishes.  In King v. Vandercomb, 2 Leach.  708, 717, 168 Eng. Rep. 455, 460 (K. B. 1796), the government abandoned, midtrial, prosecution of defendant for burglary by breaking and entering and stealing goods, because it turned out that no property had been removed on the date of the alleged burglary.  The defendant was then prosecuted for burglary by breaking and entering with intent to steal.  That second prosecution was allowed, because "these two offences are so distinct in their nature, that evidence of one of them will not support an indictment for the other." Ibid. Accord, English and American cases cited in Grady, <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 532-535</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., dissenting).  [15] *711 Having encountered today yet another situation in which the pre- <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> understanding of the Double Jeopardy Clause allows a second trial, though the "same-conduct" test would not, we think it time to acknowledge what is now, three years after <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , compellingly clear: The case was a mistake.  We do not lightly reconsider a precedent, but, because <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> contradicted an "unbroken line of decisions," contained "less than accurate" historical analysis, and has produced "confusion," [16] we do so here.  Solorio v. United States, 483 U. S. *712 435, 439, 442, 450 (1987).  Although stare decisis is the "preferred course" in constitutional adjudication, "when governing decisions are unworkable or are badly reasoned, `this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent.' " Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991) (quoting Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 665 (1944), and collecting examples).  We would mock stare decisis and only add chaos to our double jeopardy jurisprudence by pretending that <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> survives when it does not.  We therefore accept the Government's invitation to overrule <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , and Counts II, III, IV, and V of Foster's subsequent prosecution are not barred.  [17] V Dixon's subsequent prosecution, as well as Count I of Foster's subsequent prosecution, violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  [18] For the reasons set forth in Part IV, the other counts of Foster's subsequent prosecution do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  [19] The judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  *713 Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.  Respondent Alvin Dixon possessed cocaine with intent to distribute it.  For that he was held in contempt of court for violating a condition of his bail release.  He was later criminally charged for the same conduct with possession with intent to distribute cocaine.  Respondent Michael Foster assaulted and threatened his estranged wife.  For that he was held in contempt of court for violating a civil protection order entered in a domestic relations proceeding.  He was later criminally charged for the same conduct with assault, threatening to injure another, and assault with intent to kill.  The Court today concludes that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the subsequent prosecutions of Foster for assault and Dixon for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, but does not prohibit the subsequent prosecutions of Foster for threatening to injure another or for assault with intent to kill.  After finding that at least some of the charges here are not prohibited by the "same-elements" test set out in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932), the Court goes on to consider whether there is a double jeopardy bar under the "same-conduct" test set out in Grady v. Corbin, <citedDecision>495 U. S. 508, 510</citedDecision> (1990), and determines that there is.  However, because the same-conduct test is inconsistent with the text and history of the Double Jeopardy Clause, was a departure from our earlier precedents, and has proven difficult to apply, the Court concludes that <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> must be overruled.  I do not join Part III of Justice Scalia's opinion because I think that none of the criminal prosecutions in this case were barred under Blockburger .  I must then confront the expanded version of double jeopardy embodied in <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> .  For the reasons set forth in the dissent in <citedDecision>Grady, supra, at 526</citedDecision> (opinion of Scalia, J.), and in Part IV of the Court's opinion, I, too, think that <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> must be overruled.  I *714 therefore join Parts I, II, and IV of the Court's opinion, and write separately to express my disagreement with Justice Scalia's application of Blockburger in Part III. In my view, Blockburger `s same-elements test requires us to focus, not on the terms of the particular court orders involved, but on the elements of contempt of court in the ordinary sense.  Relying on Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), a three-paragraph per curiam in an unargued case, Justice Scalia concludes otherwise today, and thus incorrectly finds in Part IIIA of his opinion that the subsequent prosecutions of Dixon for drug distribution and of Foster for assault violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.  In so doing, Justice Scalia rejects the traditional viewshared by every Federal Court of Appeals and State Supreme Court that addressed the issue prior to <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> that, as a general matter, double jeopardy does not bar a subsequent prosecution based on conduct for which a defendant has been held in criminal contempt.  I cannot subscribe to a reading of Harris that upsets this previously well-settled principle of law. Because the generic crime of contempt of court has different elements than the substantive criminal charges in this case, I believe that they are separate offenses under Blockburger .  I would therefore limit Harris to the context in which it arose: where the crimes in question are analogous to greater and lesser included offenses.  The crimes at issue here bear no such resemblance.  Justice Scalia dismisses out-of-hand, see ante, at 699, the Government's reliance on several statements from our prior decisions.  See In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 594, 599-600 (1895); In re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661, 672 (1897); Jurney v. MacCracken, 294 U. S. 125, 151 (1935).  Those statements are dicta, to be sure, and thus not binding on us as stare decisis.  Yet they are still significant in that they reflect the unchallenged contemporaneous view among all courts that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit separate prosecutions for contempt and a substantive offense based *715 on the same conduct.  [1] This view, which dates back to the English common law, see F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice § 444, p. 300 (8th ed. 1880), has prevailed to the present day. See generally 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law § 250, p. 446 (1981).  In fact, every Federal Court of Appeals and state court of last resort to consider the issue before <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> agreed that there is no double jeopardy bar to successive prosecutions for criminal contempt and substantive criminal offenses based on the same conduct.  See, e. g., Hansen v. United States, 1 F. 2d 316, 317 (CA7 1924); Orban v. United States, 18 F. 2d 374, 375 (CA6 1927); State v. Sammons, 656 S. W. 2d 862, 868-869 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1982); Commonwealth v. Allen, 506 Pa. 500, 511-516 , 486 A. 2d 363, 368-371 (1984), cert. denied, 474 U. S. 842 (1985); People v. Totten, 118 Ill. 2d 124, 134-139 , 514 N. E. 2d 959, 963-965 (1987).  [2] It is somewhat ironic, I think, that Justice Scalia today adopts a view of double jeopardy that did not come to the fore until after <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , a decision which he (for the Court) goes on to emphatically reject as "lack[ing] constitutional roots." Ante, at 704.  At the heart of this pre- <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> consensus lay the common belief that there was no double jeopardy bar under Blockburger .  There, we stated that two offenses are different for *716 purposes of double jeopardy if "each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not." 284 U. S., at 304 (emphasis added).  Applying this test to the offenses at bar, it is clear that the elements of the governing contempt provision are entirely different from the elements of the substantive crimes.  Contempt of court comprises two elements: (i) a court order made known to the defendant, followed by (ii) willful violation of that order.  In re Gorfkle, 444 A. 2d 934, 939 (D. C. 1982); In re Thompson, 454 A. 2d 1324, 1326 (D. C. 1982).  Neither of those elements is necessarily satisfied by proof that a defendant has committed the substantive offenses of assault or drug distribution.

Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U. S. 1, 12, n. 4 (1991); accord, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 671 (1974).  Today's decision shows the pitfalls inherent in reading too much into a "terse per curiam.  " Ante, at 698.  Justice Scalia's discussion of Harris is nearly as long as Harris itself and consists largely of a quote, not from Harris , but from a subsequent opinion analyzing Harris .  Justice Scalia then concludes that Harris somehow requires us to look to the facts that must be proved under the particular court orders in question (rather than under the general law of criminal contempt) in determining whether contempt and the related substantive offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes.  This interpretation of Harris is both unprecedented and mistaken.  Our double jeopardy cases applying Blockburger have focused on the statutory elements of the offenses charged, not *717 on the facts that must be proved under the particular indictment at issuean indictment being the closest analogue to the court orders in this case. See, e. g., Grady, <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 528</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("Th[e] test focuses on the statutory elements of the two crimes with which a defendant has been charged, not on the proof that is offered or relied upon to secure a conviction"); Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S. 333, 338 (1981) ("`[T]he Court's application of the test focuses on the statutory elements of the offense' " (quoting Iannelli v. United States, 420 U. S. 770, 785, n. 17 (1975))); United States v. Woodward, 469 U. S. 105, 108 (1985) (per curiam) (looking to the statutory elements of the offense in applying Blockburger ).  By focusing on the facts needed to show a violation of the specific court orders involved in this case, and not on the generic elements of the crime of contempt of court, Justice Scalia's double jeopardy analysis bears a striking resemblance to that found in <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> not what one would expect in an opinion that overrules <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> .  Close inspection of the crimes at issue in Harris reveals, moreover, that our decision in that case was not a departure from Blockburger `s focus on the statutory elements of the offenses charged.  In Harris , we held that a conviction for felony murder based on a killing in the course of an armed robbery foreclosed a subsequent prosecution for robbery with a firearm.  Though the felony-murder statute in Harris did not require proof of armed robbery, it did include as an element proof that the defendant was engaged in the commission of some felony.  Harris v. State, 555 P. 2d 76, 80 (Okla. Crim. App. 1976).  We construed this generic reference to some felony as incorporating the statutory elements of the various felonies upon which a felony-murder conviction could rest. Cf. Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684, 694 (1980).  The criminal contempt provision involved here, by contrast, contains no such generic reference which by definition incorporates the statutory elements of assault or drug distribution.
**Combined Opinion**
 The same cannot be said, of course, about this case: A defendant who is guilty of possession with intent to distribute cocaine or of assault has not necessarily satisfied any statutory element of criminal contempt.  Nor, for that matter, can it be said that a defendant who is held in criminal contempt has necessarily satisfied any *719 element of those substantive crimes.  In short, the offenses for which Dixon and Foster were prosecuted in this case cannot be analogized to greater and lesser included offenses; hence, they are separate and distinct for double jeopardy purposes.  [3] The following analogy, raised by the Government at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9, helps illustrate the absurd results that Justice Scalia's Harris / Blockburger analysis could in theory produce.  Suppose that the offense in question is failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, see, e. g., Ind. Code § 9-21 -81 (Supp. 1992), and that the police officer's order was, "Don't shoot that man." Under Justice Scalia's flawed reading of Harris, the elements of the offense of failure to obey a police officer's lawful order would include, for purposes of Blockburger `s sameelements test, the elements of, perhaps, murder or manslaughter, in effect converting those felonies into a lesser included offense of the crime of failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer.  In sum, I think that the substantive criminal prosecutions in this case, which followed convictions for criminal contempt, *720 did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, at least before our decision in <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> .  Under <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , "the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted." <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 510</citedDecision> .  As the Court points out, see ante, at 703-704, this case undoubtedly falls within that expansive formulation: To secure convictions on the substantive criminal charges in this case, the Government will have to prove conduct that was the basis for the contempt convictions.  Forced, then, to confront <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , I join the Court in overruling that decision.  Justice White, with whom Justice Stevens joins, and with whom Justice Souter joins as to Part I, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.  I am convinced that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for an offense if the defendant already has been held in contempt for its commission.  Therefore, I agree with the Court's conclusion that both Dixon's prosecution for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and Foster's prosecution for simple assault were prohibited.  In my view, however, Justice Scalia's opinion gives short shrift to the arguments raised by the United States.  I also am uncomfortable with the reasoning underlying this holding, in particular the application of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), to the facts of this case, a reasoning that betrays an overly technical interpretation of the Constitution.  As a result, I concur only in the judgment in Part IIIA.  The mischief in the Court's approach is far more apparent in the second portion of today's decision.  Constrained by its narrow reading of the Double Jeopardy Clause, it asserts that the fate of Foster's remaining counts depends on Grady v. Corbin, <citedDecision>495 U. S. 508</citedDecision> (1990), which the Court then chooses *721 to overrule.  Ante, at 704.  I do not agree.  Resolution of the question presented by Foster's case no more requires reliance on <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> than it points to reasons for reversing that decision.  Rather, as I construe the Clause, double jeopardy principles compel equal treatment of all of Foster's counts.  I dissent from the Court's holding to the contrary.  Inasmuch as <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> has been dragged into this case, however, I agree with Justice Blackmun and Justice Souter that it should not be overruled.  Post, at 741, 744.  From this aspect of the Court's opinion as well, I dissent.  I The chief issue before us is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause applies at all to cases such as these.  Justice Scalia finds that it applies, but does so in conclusory fashion, without dealing adequately with either the Government's arguments or the practical consequences of today's decision.  Both, in my view, are worthy of more.  A The position of the United States is that, for the purpose of applying the Double Jeopardy Clause, a charge of criminal contempt for engaging in conduct that is proscribed by court order and that is in turn forbidden by the criminal code is an offense separate from the statutory crime.
**Combined Opinion**
 In the civil tribunal, the prosecution was required to prove (1) the killing, and (2) some further element, as specified.  Had Grafton been tried in 1993 rather than 1907, I suppose that an inflexible Blockburger test, which asks whether "each provision requires proof of a fact the other does not," 284 U. S., at 304 , would uncover no double jeopardy problem.  At the time, though, the Court looked at matters differently: Both trials being for the same killing, and "[t]he identity of the offenses [being] determined, *740 not by their grade, but by their nature," id. , at 350, prosecuting Grafton for assassination meant twice putting him in jeopardy for the same offense.  I would dispose of Foster's case in like fashion, and focus on what Justice Scalia overlooks: The interests safeguarded by the Double Jeopardy Clause, and the fact that Foster should not have to defend himself twice against the same charges.  When the case is so viewed, the condition that Foster be subject to a contempt order as a practical matter is analogous to the condition that Grafton be a soldier, for it triggered the court's authority to punish offenses already prescribed by the criminal law. At that point, the relevant comparison for double jeopardy purposes should be between the offenses charged in the two proceedings.  III Once it is agreed that the Double Jeopardy Clause applies in this context, the Clause, properly construed, both governs this case and disposes of the distinction between Foster's charges upon which Justice Scalia relies.  I therefore see little need to draw <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> into this dispute.  In any event, the United States itself has not attempted to distinguish between Dixon and Foster or between the charges of "assault" on the one hand and, on the other, "assault with intent to kill" and "threat to injure another." The issue was not raised before the Court of Appeals or considered by it, and it was neither presented in the petition for certiorari nor briefed by either party.  Under these circumstances, it is injudicious to address this matter.  See, e. g., Mazer v. Stein, 347 U. S. 201, 206, n. 5 (1954); Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U. S. 144, 147, n. 2 (1970).  The majority nonetheless has chosen to consider <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> anew and to overrule it.  I agree with Justice Blackmun and Justice Souter that such a course is both unwarranted and unwise.  See post, at 741, 744.  Hence, I dissent from the judgment overruling <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> .  *741 IV Believing that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars Foster's and Dixon's successive prosecutions on all counts, I would affirm the judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  I concur in the judgment of the Court in Part IIIA, which holds that Dixon's subsequent prosecution and Count I of Foster's subsequent prosecution were barred.  I disagree with Justice Scalia's application of Blockburger in Part IIIB.  From Part IV of the opinion, in which the majority decides to overrule <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , I dissent.  Justice Blackmun, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.  I cannot agree that contempt of court is the "same offence" under the Double Jeopardy Clause as either assault with intent to kill or possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it.  I write separately to emphasize two interrelated points.  I I agree with Justice Souter that "the Blockburger test is not the exclusive standard for determining whether the rule against successive prosecutions applies in a given case." Post, at 756.  I also share both his and Justice White's dismay that the Court so cavalierly has overruled a precedent that is barely three years old and that has proved neither unworkable nor unsound.  I continue to believe that Grady v. Corbin, <citedDecision>495 U. S. 508</citedDecision> (1990), was correctly decided, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a subsequent criminal prosecution where the proof required to convict on the later offense would require proving conduct that constitutes an offense for which a defendant already has been prosecuted.  If this were a case involving successive prosecutions under the substantive criminal law (as was true in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410 (1980), and <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> ), I would agree that the Double Jeopardy *742 Clause could bar the subsequent prosecution.  But we are concerned here with contempt of court, a special situation.  We explained in Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U. S. 787 (1987): "The fact that we have come to regard criminal contempt as `a crime in the ordinary sense,' [ Bloom v. Illi- nois, 391 U. S. 194, 201 (1968)], does not mean that any prosecution of contempt must now be considered an execution of the criminal law in which only the Executive Branch may engage.  .  .  .  That criminal procedure protections are now required in such prosecutions should not obscure the fact that these proceedings are not intended to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws.

Brief for Ayuda et al. as Amici Curiae 20 (emphasis in original).  Finally, I cannot so easily distinguish between "summary" and "nonsummary" contempt proceedings, ante, at 696-697, for the interests served in both are fundamentally similar.  It is as much a "disruption of judicial process," ante, at 695, to disobey a judge's conditional release order as it is to disturb a judge's courtroom.  And the interests served in vindicating the authority of the court are fundamentally different from those served by the prosecution of violations of the substantive criminal law. Because I believe that neither Dixon nor Foster would be "subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb," U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, I would reverse the judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens joins, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.  While I agree with the Court as far as it goes in holding that a citation for criminal contempt and an indictment for violating a substantive criminal statute may amount to charges of the "same offence" for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, I cannot join the Court in restricting the Clause's reach and dismembering the protection against successive prosecution that the Constitution *744 was meant to provide.  The Court has read our precedents so narrowly as to leave them bereft of the principles animating that protection, and has chosen to overrule the most recent of the relevant cases, Grady v. Corbin, <citedDecision>495 U. S. 508</citedDecision> (1990), decided three years ago.  Because I think that <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> was correctly decided, amounting merely to an expression of just those animating principles, and because, even if the decision had been wrong in the first instance, there is no warrant for overruling it now, I respectfully dissent.  I join Part I of Justice White's opinion, and I would hold, as he would, both the prosecution of Dixon and the prosecution of Foster under all the counts of the indictment against him to be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  [1] I In providing that no person shall "be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb," U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against two distinct types of abuses.  See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969).  It protects against being punished more than once for a single offense, or "multiple punishment." Where a person is being subjected to more than one sentence, the Double Jeopardy Clause ensures that he is not receiving for one offense more than the punishment authorized.  The Clause also protects against being prosecuted for the same offense more than once, or "successive prosecution."

Id., at 420.  Over a decade ago, then, we clearly understood Harris to stand for the proposition that when one has already been tried for a crime comprising certain conduct, a subsequent prosecution seeking to prove the same conduct is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  [8] This is in no way inconsistent with Vitale `s description of Harris as "treat[ing] a killing in the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense, and the robbery as a species of lesser-included offense." 447 U. S., at 420 .  The very act of "treating" it that way was a departure from straight Blockburger analysis; it was the same departure taken by the Nielsen Court. Vitale read Harris (which itself quoted Nielsen ) to hold that even if the Blockburger test were satisfied, a second prosecution would not be permitted for conduct comprising the criminal act charged in the first.  Nielsen and Harris used the word "incident," while Vitale used the word "conduct," but no matter which word is used to describe the unlawful activity for which one cannot again be forced to stand trial, the import of this successive-prosecution strand of our double jeopardy jurisprudence is clear.  Even if this had not been clear since the time of In re Nielsen, any debate should have been settled by our decision three Terms ago in Grady v. Corbin, <citedDecision>495 U. S. 508</citedDecision> (1990), *758 that "the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted." <citedDecision>Id., at 510</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> did nothing more than apply a version of the Nielsen rule.  As against this sequence of consistent reasoning from Nielsen to <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , the Court's citation to two cases, Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S. 338, 343 (1911), and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), cannot validate its insistence that, prior to <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , our exclusive standard for barring successive prosecutions under the Double Jeopardy Clause was the Blockburger test.  See ante, at 707-708.  Burton came before the Court on a demurrer.  The Court there was not presented with the factual basis for the charges, and simply held that two offenses, accepting a bribe from a company and accepting the same bribe from an officer of that company, were "not identical, in law." 202 U. S., at 381 ; see also id., at 379 ("[T]he question presented is whether, upon the face of the record, as matter of law simply, the offense charged in the third and seventh counts of the present indictment is the same as that charged in the third count of the former indictment") (emphasis in original); Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 198, n. 2 (1959) (opinion of Brennan, J.).  Rather than proving that the Blockburger same-elements test was always the Court's exclusive guide to evaluation of successive prosecutions prior to Grady, Burton stands only for the proposition that a claim of double jeopardy resting exclusively on pleadings cannot be adjudicated on any basis except the elements pleaded.  Gavieres is in fact the only case that may even be read to suggest that the Court ever treated a Blockburger analysis as the exclusive successive prosecution test under the Double Jeopardy Clause, and its precedential force is weak.  Gavieres was an interpretation not of the Constitution, but *759 of an Act of Congress applicable to the Philippines, providing that "no person for the same offense shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment." Act of July 1, 1902, ch. 1369, § 5, 32 Stat. 692 .  It is true that in his opinion for the Court in Gavieres , Justice Day wrote that we had held in Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100 (1904), "that the protection against double jeopardy therein provided had, by means of this statute, been carried to the Philippine Islands in the sense and in the meaning which it had obtained under the Constitution and laws of the United States." 220 U. S., at 341 .  Nonetheless, this Court has declined to treat decisions under that statute as authoritative constructions of the Fifth Amendment.  See Green v. United States, 355 U. S., at 197 , and n. 16; see also Abbate , supra, at 198, n. 2 (opinion of Brennan, J.).  VI Burton and Gavieres thus lend no support for the Court's decision to overrule <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> and constrict Harris.  Whatever may have been the merits of the debate in <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , the decision deserves more respect than it receives from the Court today.  "Although adherence to precedent is not rigidly required in constitutional cases, any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification.  See, e. g., Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965); Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 665 (1944)." Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).  The search for any justification fails to reveal that <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> `s conclusion was either "unsound in principle," or "unworkable in practice." Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 546 (1985).  <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> `s rule is straightforward, and a departure from it is not justified by the fact that two Court of Appeals decisions have described it as difficult to apply, see ante, at 711-712, n. 16, one apparently because it must be distinguished from the "same evidence" test, see Ladner v. Smith, 941 F. 2d 356, 363-364 (CA5 1991).  Nor does the fact that one of those courts has *760 broken the single sentence of <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> `s holding into its four constituent clauses before applying it, see Ladner, supra, reveal a type of "`confusion,' " ante, at 711 (citation omitted), that can somehow obviate our obligation to adhere to precedent.  Cf. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173-174 (1989).  Nor do Burton and Gavieres have the strength to justify the Court's reading of Harris solely for the narrow proposition that, in a case where a statute refers to other offenses, the elements of those offenses are incorporated by reference in the statute.  [9] While reading the case this way might suffice for purposes of avoiding multiple punishment, this reading would work an unprecedented truncation of the protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause against successive prosecutions, by transferring the government's leeway in determining how many offenses to create to the assessment of how many times a person may be prosecuted for the same conduct.  The Double Jeopardy Clause then would provide no more protection against successive prosecutions than it provides against multiple punishments, and instead of expressing some principle underlying the protection against double jeopardy, Harris would be an anomaly, an "exceptio[n]" to Blockburger without principled justification.  Grady, <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 528</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., dissenting).  By relying on that anomaly and by defining its offenses with care, the government could not merely add punishment to *761 punishment (within Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment limits), but could bring a person to trial again and again for that same conduct, violating the principle of finality, subjecting him repeatedly to all the burdens of trial, rehearsing its prosecution, and increasing the risk of erroneous conviction, all in contravention of the principles behind the protection from successive prosecutions included in the Fifth Amendment.  The protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause against successive prosecutions is not so fragile that it can be avoided by finely drafted statutes and carefully planned prosecutions.  VII I would not invite any such consequences and would here apply our successive prosecution decisions (from Nielsen to <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> ) to conclude that the prosecutions below were barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Dixon was prosecuted for violating a court order to "[r]efrain from committing any criminal offense." App. 8.  The contempt prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had possessed cocaine with intent to distribute it.  His prosecution, therefore, for possession with intent to distribute cocaine based on the same incident is barred.  It is of course true that the elements of the two offenses can be treated as different.  In the contempt conviction, the Government had to prove knowledge of the court order as well as Dixon's commission of some criminal offense.
**Combined Opinion**
 .  .  with intent to kill" as a result of his actions on May 21, 1988.  App. 43-44.  The Court concludes that the later prosecutions are not barred, because in its view the offenses charged in the indictment each contained an element not contained in the contempt charge (with respect to the threats, that they be threats to kidnap, to inflict bodily injury, or to damage property; with respect to the assault, that it be undertaken with an intent to kill); and *763 because the contempt charge contained an element not specified by the criminal code sections that formed the basis for the indictment (violation of the CPO).  See ante, at 700-703.  [11] In each instance, however, the second prosecution is barred under Nielsen, Harris as we construed it in Vitale , and <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> .  The conduct at issue constituted the conduct in the contempts first charged as well as in the crimes subsequently prosecuted, and the Government's prosecution of Foster twice for the conduct common to both would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  VIII Grady simply applied a rule with roots in our cases going back well over 100 years.  Nielsen held that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars successive prosecutions for more than one statutory offense where the charges comprise the same act, and Harris, as understood in Vitale , is properly read as standing for the same rule.  Overruling <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> alone cannot remove this principle from our constitutional jurisprudence.  Only by uprooting the entire sequence of cases, Grady, Vitale, Harris, and Nielsen , could this constitutional principle be undone.  Because I would not do that, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I concur in the judgment of the Court in Dixon and with respect to Count I in Foster, but respectfully dissent from the disposition of the case with respect to Counts IIV in Foster.  NOTES [*] Clifton S. Elgarten, Susan M. Hoffman, Susan Deller Ross, Naomi Cahn, Laura Foggan, and Catherine F. Klein filed a brief for Ayuda et al. as amici curiae urging reversal.  [1]  was Commentaries *280*285.  That limitation closely followed in American courts.
**Combined Opinion**
 [6]  Given this requirement of willful violation of the order, Justice White's desire to "put to the side the CPO," because it only "triggered the court's authority" cannot be reconciled with his desire to "compar[e] the substantive offenses of which respondents stood accused." Post, at 734.  The "substantive offense" of criminal contempt is willful violation of a court order.  Far from a mere jurisdictional device, that order (or CPO) is the centerpiece of the entire proceeding.  Its terms define the prohibited conduct, its existence supports imposition of a criminal penalty, and willful violation of it is necessary for conviction.  To ignore the CPO when determining whether two offenses are the "same" is no more possible than putting aside the statutory definitions of criminal offenses.  Of course, Justice White's view that the elements of criminal contempt are essentially irrelevant for double jeopardy analysis does have precedent albeit erroneousin <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> `s same-conduct test.  Grady v. Corbin, <citedDecision>495 U. S. 508</citedDecision> (1990).  Justice Souter also ignores the knowledge element.  Post, at 761, n. 10.  [7]  We accept, as we ordinarily do, the construction of a District of Columbia law adopted by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  See, e. g., Pernell v. Southall Realty, 416 U. S. 363, 368-369 (1974).  The construction here has sound support in the text of the statute.  Compare D. C. Code Ann. § 22-501 (1989) (assault with intent to kill, rob, rape, or poison) with § 22-504 (assault).
**Combined Opinion**
 Surely "in any manner threaten" should cover at least all threats to commit acts that would be tortious under District of Columbia law (which would be consistent with the trial court's later reference to a "legal threat").  Thus, under our Blockburger analysis the aggravated threat counts and the assault-with-intent-to-kill count come out the same way.  [10]  Justice White attempts to avoid this issue altogether because, in his view, it would be "injudicious" to consider the differences in Foster, not pressed by the Government, between the CPO restrictions and the alleged statutory offenses.  Post, at 740.  Of course, these differences are pure facts, apparent on the face of the CPO and the indictment.  They do not alter the question presented, which assumes only that the prosecuted conduct was the same, see supra, at 694, not that the terms of the CPO and the statute were.  Further, although the Government did not argue that the different counts in Foster should come out differently, it did argue (as we do) that they all should be evaluated under Blockburger and not <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> , see, e. g., Brief for United States 14-15, 42; and we are not aware of any principle that prevents us from accepting a litigant's legal theory unless we agree with the litigant on all the applications of the theory.  The standard to be applied in determining the double jeopardy effect of criminal charges based on the same conduct ( Blockburger vs. <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> ) assuredly is included within the question presented.  That makes Justice White's citation of cases declining to consider legal issues not raised below wholly beside the point.  Nor can we see any abuse of what Justice White himself regards as a prudential limitation, when the evident factual difference between the charges and the CPO order is central to proper constitutional analysis.  [11]  Justice Souter has apparently been led astray by his misinterpretation of the word "incidents" in the following passage of Nielsen : "[W]here, as in this case, a person has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it, he cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents without being twice put in jeopardy for the same offence." 131 U. S., at 188 .  He apparently takes "incident" to mean "event" or "conduct." See post, at 752, and n. 5, 757-758.
**Combined Opinion**
 Since military status was not an element of Grafton's charged offense, it is not true that our analysis would produce a result contrary to the opinion in Grafton .  Under the traditional Blockburger elements test, assassination, as defined in Article 403 of the Philippines Penal Code, contained an element that homicide, as defined in Article 404, did not; but, as the Court noted, homicide did not contain any element not included in assassination.  206 U. S., at 350 ("One crime may be a constituent part of the other"); accord, id., at 355 (he "could not subsequently be tried for the same offense").  Grafton could therefore not later be prosecuted for assassination, much less later be convicted for the very same homicide offense of which he had been acquitted.  (In fact, Grafton may simply have been decided on grounds of collateral estoppel, see id., at 349-351 , an issue that we specifically decline to reach in this case, see n. 17, infra.  ) [15]  It is unclear what definition of "same offence" Justice Souter would have us adopt for successive prosecution.  At times, he appears content with our having added to Blockburger the <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> same-conduct test.  At other times, however, he adopts an ultra-Grady "same transaction" rule, which would require the Government to try together all offenses (regardless of the differences in the statutes) based on one event.  See post, at 747, 761.  Of course, the same-transaction test, long espoused by Justice Brennan, see, e. g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 170 (1977) (concurring opinion), has been consistently rejected by the Court. See, e. g., Garrett v. United States, 471 U. S. 773, 790 (1985).  [16]  Justice Souter dislikes this result because it violates "the principles behind the protection from successive prosecutions included in the Fifth Amendment." Post, at 761.  The "principles behind" the Fifth Amendment are more likely to be honored by following longstanding practice than by following intuition.  But in any case, Justice Souter's concern that prosecutors will bring separate prosecutions in order to perfect their case seems unjustified.  They have little to gain and much to lose from such a strategy.  Under Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), an acquittal in the first prosecution might well bar litigation of certain facts essential to the second onethough a conviction in the first prosecution would not excuse the Government from proving the same facts the second time.  Surely, moreover, the Government must be deterred from abusive, repeated prosecutions of a single offender for similar offenses by the sheer press of other demands upon prosecutorial and judicial resources.  Finally, even if Justice Souter's fear were well founded, no double jeopardy bar short of a same-transaction analysis will eliminate this problem; but that interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause has been soundly rejected, see, e. g., Garrett, supra, and would require overruling numerous precedents, the latest of which is barely a year old, United States v. Felix, 503 U. S. 378 (1992).  [17]  See, e. g., Sharpton v. Turner, 964 F. 2d 1284, 1287 (CA2) ( <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> formulation "has proven difficult to apply" and "whatever difficulties we have previously encountered in grappling with the <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> language have not been eased by" Felix ), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 986 (1992); Ladner v. Smith, 941 F. 2d 356, 362, 364 (CA5 1991) (a divided court adopts a four-part test for application of Grady and notes that Grady, "even if carefully analyzed and painstakingly administered, is not easy to apply"), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 983 (1992); United States v. Calderone, 917 F. 2d 717 (CA2 1990) (divided court issues three opinions construing Grady ), vacated and remanded, 503 U.

Supp. 1431, 1434-1436 (SDNY 1991) ("[T]he lower courts have had difficulty discerning the precise boundaries of the Grady standard, and the circuits have not applied uniformly the `same conduct' test"), rev'd, 967 F. 2d 57 (CA2), cert. denied sub nom. Vives v. United States, 506 U. S. 987 (1992); State v. Woodfork, 239 Neb. 720, 725 , 478 N.

State, 810 P. 2d 93, 99, 104 (Wyo. 1991) (majority states that "[t]he Supreme Court did not really develop any new law in Grady with respect to successive prosecutions," while dissent concludes that Grady requires reversal).Commentators have confirmed that <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> contributed confusion rather than certainty.See Poulin, Double Jeopardy Protectionagainst Successive Prosecutions in Complex Criminal Cases:A Model, 25 Conn. L. Rev. 95 (1992); Thomas, A Modest Proposal to Save the Double Jeopardy Clause, 69 Wash. U. L. Q. 195 (1991).  [18]  We do not address the motion to dismiss the threat counts based on collateral estoppel, see Ashe v. Swenson, supra , because neitherlower court ruled on that issue.  [19]  Justices White, Stevens, and Souter concur in this portion of the judgment.  [1]  Justice Blackmun concurs only in the judgment with respect to this portion.  [2]  Justice Scalia suggests that the dicta in those earlier cases are of limited value in light of Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194 (1968), which held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial applies to nonsummary contempt prosecutions.  But there is simply no reason to think that the dicta in those cases were based on the understanding that prosecutions for contempt were not subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Rather, the principal theme running through the pre- <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> cases is that, while nonsummary contempt is a criminal prosecution, that prosecution and the later one for a substantive offense involve two separate and distinct offenses.  [3]  The Court's discussion of the use of the contempt power at common law and in 19th-century America, see ante, at 694-695, does not undercut the relevance of these later, pre- <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> decisionsmost of which are from the late 20th centuryto the instant case. [1]  Assuming, arguendo, that Justice Scalia's reading of Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), is accurate, and that we must look to the terms of the particular court orders involved, I believe Justice Scalia is correct in differentiating among the various counts in Foster.  The court order there provided that Foster must "`not molest, assault, or in any manner threaten or physically abuse' " his estranged wife.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.  For Foster to be found in contempt of court, his wife need have proved only that he had knowledge of the court order and that he assaulted or threatened her, but not that he assaulted her with intent to kill (Count V) or that he threatened to inflict bodily harm (Counts IIIV).  So the crime of criminal contempt in Foster, even if analyzed under Justice Scalia's reading of Harris, is nonetheless a different offense under Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), than the crimes alleged in Counts IIV of the indictment, since "each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not." Id., at 304 .  Because Justice Scalia finds no double jeopardy bar with respect to those counts, I agree with the result reached in Part IIIB of his opinion.
**Combined Opinion**
 See Brief for United States 26 (describing the order not to "assault or in any manner threaten" as "direct[ing] Foster .  .  .  to refrain from engaging in criminal conduct").  In any event, even assuming that the prohibition in the court order referred to threats other than those already outlawed, that should not change the outcome of this case. The offense prohibited in the CPOto threaten "in any manner"at the very least is "an incident and part of," In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176, 187 (1889),the offense of criminal threat defined in § 22-2307.  Therefore, for reasons explained below, prosecution for one should preclude subsequent prosecution for the other.  [9]  Therefore, I obviously disagree with The Chief Justice's Blockburger analysis which would require overruling not only Grady v. Corbin, <citedDecision>495 U. S. 508</citedDecision> (1990), but, as Justice Scalia explains, Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), as well.  See ante, at 698.  At the very least, where conviction of the crime of contempt cannot be had without conviction of a statutory crime forbidden by court order, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for the latter after acquittal or conviction of the former.  [10]  Similar results follow, of course, from The Chief Justice's interpretation of the Clause.  [1]  Justice Scalia's dismissal of this concern is difficult to follow.  As I understand it, he maintains that no double jeopardy problem exists because under Blockburger a conviction for assault would not be upheld.  See ante, at 702, n. 7.
**Combined Opinion**
Id. , at 662.  Indeed, I would have imagined that Justice Scalia would agree.  As he recently wrote: "Since the Double Jeopardy Clause protects the defendant from being `twice put in jeopardy,' i.  e., made to stand trial .  .  .for the `same offence,' it presupposes that sameness can be determined before the second trial. Otherwise, the Clause would have prohibited a second `conviction' or `sentence' for the same offense." Grady, <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 529</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added).  This double jeopardy predicament, of course, could be avoided by Foster's attorney not requesting the lesser included offense instructions to which his client is entitled.But to place a defendant before such a choice hardly strikes me as a satisfactory resolution.  [2]  Consequently, I concur in the Court's judgment with respect to Dixon's prosecution and the prosecution of Foster under Count I of the indictment against him.  [3]  For purposes of this case I need express no view on this question, whether the proscription of punishment for state-law offenses that fail the Blockburger test can somehow be overcome by a clearly shown legislative intent that they be punished separately.  See Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S. 333, 344-345 (1981) (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment).  [4]  Our cases have long made clear that the order in which one is prosecuted for two crimes alleged to be the same matters not in demonstrating a violation of double jeopardy.  See Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 168 (1977) ("[T]he sequence is immaterial").
**Combined Opinion**
[7]  Our cases, of course, hold that the same protection inheres after an acquittal.  See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969).  [8]  In Brown we recognized that "[a]n exception may exist where the State is unable to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset because the additional facts necessary to sustain that charge have not occurred or have not been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence." 432 U. S., at 169, n. 7 .  [9]  It is true that in light of its decision to remand the case to provide the State further opportunity to put forward some other basis for its prosecution, the Vitale Court, appropriately, described the claim only as "substantial." The important point, however, is the way in which the Court in Vitale (and, for that matter, the dissent in that case, see 447 U. S., at 426 (opinion of Stevens, J.)) read the Harris opinion.  [10]  Indeed, at least where the common elements of the offenses themselves describe a separate criminal offense, the Court's reading of Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), is apparently inconsistent even with the historical understanding of the Clause put forward by three of the dissenters in <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> .  See Grady v. Corbin, <citedDecision>495 U. S. 508, 531</citedDecision> (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting 1 T. Starkie, Criminal Pleading, ch. xix, pp. 322-323 (2d ed. 1822)) ("`[I]f one charge consist of the circumstances A. B. C. and another of the circumstances A. D. E. then, if the circumstance which belongs to them in common does not of itself constitute a distinct substantive offence, an acquittal from the one charge cannot include an acquittal of the other' ") (emphasis supplied).  [11]  I agree, therefore, with Justice White that the element of knowledge of a court order is irrelevant for double jeopardy purposes.  See ante, at 734 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  []  I note that atleast the charge concerning assault with intent to kill would apparently have been barred under the approach taken in Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in <citedDecision>Grady</citedDecision> .  See n. 9, supra.
