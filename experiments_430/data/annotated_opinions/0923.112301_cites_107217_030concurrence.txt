**Concurrence Opinion**
*344 Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  I join the Court’s disposition of this suit and Parts I and IV of its opinion.  The Connecticut statute’s invalidity is fully established by its facial discrimination against interstate commerce — through imposition of price restrictions exclusively upon those who sell beer not only in Connecticut but also in the surrounding States — and by Connecticut’s inability to establish that the law’s asserted goal of lower consumer prices cannot be achieved in a nondiscriminatory manner.  * See New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 276-277, 279-280 (1988).  This is so despite the fact that the law regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages, since its discriminatory character eliminates the immunity afforded by the Twenty-first Amendment.  See Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 275-276 (1984).  Since Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, <citedDecision>384 U. S. 35</citedDecision> (1966), upheld a law that operated in like fashion, I agree with the Court that today’s decision requires us to overrule that case. See ante, at 343.  *345 I would refrain, however, from applying the more expansive analysis which finds the law unconstitutional because it regulates or controls beer pricing in the surrounding States.  See ante, at 335-340.  It seems to me this rationale is not only unnecessary but also questionable, resting as it does upon the mere economic reality that the challenged law will require sellers in New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island to take account of the price that they must post and charge in Connecticut when setting their prices in those other States.  The difficulty with this is that innumerable valid state laws affect pricing decisions in other States — even so rudimentary a law as a maximum price regulation.  Suppose, for example, that the Connecticut Legislature had simply provided that beer could not be retailed in Connecticut above $10 a case. Sellers in those portions of New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island bordering Connecticut would have to take account of that requirement, just as sellers in those States had to take account of the Connecticut posting requirement here, because prices substantially above the maximum would cause their former in-state purchasers to drive to Connecticut and their former Connecticut purchasers to stay home.  The out-of-state impact in this particular example would not be as severe as that in the present cases, but I do not think our Commerce Clause jurisprudence should degenerate into disputes over degree of economic effect.
