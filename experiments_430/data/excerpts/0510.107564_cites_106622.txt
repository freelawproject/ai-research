 Cf. Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U. S. 622 ; Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77 .  In support of their respective claims, the parties have compiled competing lists of “protected areas” for our consideration.  It appears to be common ground that a private home is such an area, Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 , but that an open field is not.  Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 .  Defending the inclusion of a telephone booth in his fist the petitioner cites United States v. Stone, 232 F. Supp. 396 , and United States v. Madison, 32 L. W. 2243 (D. C. Ct. Gen. Sess.).  Urging that the telephone booth should be excluded, the Government finds support in United States v. Borgese, 235 F. Supp. 286 .  It is true that this Court has occasionally described its conclusions in terms of “constitutionally protected areas,” see, e. g., Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 510, 512 ; Lopez v. United States, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 427, 438-439</citedDecision> ; Berger v. New York, 388 U.

We do not deal in this case with the law of detention or arrest under the Fourth Amendment.  Based upon their previous visual observations of the petitioner, the agents correctly predicted that he would use the telephone booth for several minutes at approximately the same time each morning.

 serves to minimize the hazards of the officers’ dangerous calling,” id., at 57-58 , these considerations are not rele *356 vant to the problems presented by judicially authorized electronic surveillance.  Nor do the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure impose an inflexible requirement of prior notice.  Rule 41 (d) does require federal officers to serve upon the person searched a copy of the warrant and a receipt describing the material obtained, but it does not invariably require that this be done before the search takes place.  Nordelli v. United States, 24 F. 2d 665, 666-667 .  Thus the fact that the petitioner in Osborn was unaware that his words were being electronically transcribed did not prevent this Court from sustaining his conviction, and did not prevent the Court in Berger from reaching the conclusion that the use of the recording device sanctioned in Osborn was entirely lawful.  388 U. S. 41, 57 .  Lopez v. United States, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 427, 464</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion of Me. Justice BRENNAN).  See, e. g., Jones v. United States, 357 U.

United States, 267 U. S. 132, 153, 156 ; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 454-456 ; Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 174-177; Cooper v. California, 386 U. S. 58 ; Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298-300 .  In Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20, 30 , the Court stated: “The right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by which it was committed, as well as weapons and other things to effect an escape from custody, is not to be doubted.” Whatever one’s view of “the long-standing practice of searching for other proofs of guilt within the control of the accused found upon arrest,” United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56, 61 ; cf. id., at *358 71-79 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter), the concept of an “incidental’’ search cannot readily be extended to include surreptitious surveillance of an individual either immediately before, or immediately after, his arrest.  Although “[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others,” Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298-299 , there seems little likelihood that electronic surveillance would be a realistic possibility in a situation so fraught with urgency.  A search to which an individual consents meets Fourth Amendment requirements, Zap v. United States, 328 U. S. 624 , but of course “the usefulness of electronic surveillance depends on lack of notice to the suspect.” Lopez v. United States, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 427, 463</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion of MR. Justice BreNNAn).  Whether safeguards other than prior authorization by a magistrate would satisfy the Fourth Amendment in a situation involving the national security is a question not presented by this case. See Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323, 330 .
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Douglas, with whom Mr. Justice Brennan joins, concurring. While I join the opinion of the Court, I feel compelled to reply to the separate concurring opinion of my Brother White, which I view as a wholly unwarranted green light for the Executive Branch to resort to electronic eavesdropping without a warrant in cases which the Executive Branch itself labels “national security” matters. Neither the President nor the Attorney General is a magistrate. In matters where they believe national security may be involved they are not detached, disinterested, and neutral as a court or magistrate must be. Under the separation of powers created by the Constitution, the Executive Branch is not supposed to be neutral and disinterested. Rather it should vigorously inves *360 tigate and prevent breaches of national security and prosecute those who violate the pertinent federal laws. The President and Attorney General are properly interested parties, cast in the role of adversary, in national security cases. They may even be the intended victims of subversive action. Since spies and saboteurs are as entitled to the protection of the Fourth Amendment as suspected gamblers like petitioner, I cannot agree that where spies and saboteurs are involved adequate protection of Fourth Amendment rights is assured when the President and Attorney General assume both the position of adversary- and-prosecutor and disinterested, neutral magistrate. There is, so far as I understand constitutional history, no distinction under the Fourth Amendment between types of crimes. Article III, § 3, gives “treason” a very narrow definition and puts restrictions on its proof. But the Fourth Amendment draws no lines between various substantive offenses. The arrests in cases of “hot pursuit” and the arrests on visible or other evidence of probable cause cut across the board and are not peculiar to any kind of crime. I would respect the present lines of distinction and not improvise because a particular crime seems particularly heinous. When the Framers took that step, as they did with treason, the worst crime of all, they made their purpose manifest.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Thus the clear holding of the Olmstead and Goldman cases, undiluted by any question of trespass, is that eavesdropping, in both its original and modern forms, is not violative of the Fourth Amendment.  While my reading of the Olmstead and Goldman cases convinces me that they were decided on the basis of the inapplicability of the wording of the Fourth Amendment to eavesdropping, and not on any trespass basis, this is not to say that unauthorized intrusion has not played an important role in search and seizure cases. This Court has adopted an exclusionary rule to bar evidence obtained by means of such intrusions.  As I made clear in my dissenting opinion in Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, 76 , I continue to believe that this exclusionary rule formulated in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 , rests on the “supervisory power” of this Court over other federal courts and is not rooted in the Fourth Amendment.  See Wolf v. Colorado, concurring opinion, 338 U. S. 25, 39 , at 40.  See also Mapp v. Ohio, concurring opinion, 367 U. S. 643, 661-666 .  This rule has caused the Court to refuse to accept evidence where there has been such an intrusion regardless of whether there has been a search or seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  As this Court said in Lopez v. United States, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 427, 438-439</citedDecision> , “The Court has in the past sustained instances of 'electronic eavesdropping’ against constitutional challenge, when devices have been used to enable government agents to overhear conversations which would have been beyond the reach of the human ear [citing *370 Olmstead and Goldman].  It has been insisted only that the electronic device not be planted by an unlawful physical invasion of a constitutionally protected area.  Silverman v. United States.” To support its new interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, which in effect amounts to a rewriting of the language, the Court's opinion concludes that “the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been .  .  .  eroded by our subsequent decisions .  .

[*]  I also think that the course of development evinced by Silverman, supra, Wong Sun, supra, Berger, supra, and today's decision must be recognized as overruling Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 , which essentially rested on the ground that conversations were not subject to the protection of the Fourth Amendment.  [*]  In previous cases, which are undisturbed by today's decision, the Court has upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, admission at trial of evidence obtained (1) by an undercover police agent to whom a defendant speaks without knowledge that he is in the employ of the police, Hoffa v. United States, 385 U. S. 293 (1966); (2) by a recording device hidden on the person of such an informant, Lopez v. United States, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 427</citedDecision> (1963); Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323 (1966); and (3) by a policeman listening to the secret micro-wave transmissions of an agent conversing with the defendant in another location, On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747 (1952).  When one man speaks to another he takes all the risks ordinarily inherent in so doing, including the risk that the man to whom he speaks will make public what he has heard.  The Fourth Amendment does not protect against unreliable (or law-abiding) associates.  Hoffa v. United States, supra .  It is but a logical and reasonable extension of this principle that a man take the risk that his hearer, free to memorize what he hears for later verbatim repetitions, is instead recording it or transmitting it to another.  The present case deals with an entirely different situation, for as the Court emphasizes the petitioner "sought to exclude .  .
