 It is dependent upon the State for police protection and other State services the same as other citizens.  It should pay its fair share of taxes so long, but only so long, as the tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and there is no danger of interstate commerce being smothered by cumulative taxes of several states.  There is no possibility of any other state duplicating the tax involved in this case.” 330 So. 2d, at 272 .  Appellant, in its complaint in Chancery Court, did not allege that its activity which Mississippi taxes does not have a *278 sufficient nexus with the State; or that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce; or that the tax is unfairly apportioned; or that it is unrelated to services provided by the State.  6 No such claims were made before the Mississippi Supreme Court, and although appellant argues here that a tax on “the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce” creates an unacceptable risk of discrimination and undue burdens, Brief for Appellant 20-27, it does not claim that discrimination or undue burdens exist in fact.  Appellant's attack is based solely on decisions of this Court holding that a tax on the “privilege” of engaging in an activity in the State may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce.  See, e. g., Spector Motor Service v. O’Connor, <citedDecision>340 U. S. 602</citedDecision> (1951); Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249 (1946).  This rule looks only to the fact that the incidence of the tax is the “privilege of doing business”; it deems irrelevant any consideration of the practical effect of the tax. The rule reflects an underlying philosophy that interstate commerce should enjoy a sort of “free trade” immunity from state taxation.  7 *279 Appellee, in its turn, relies on decisions of this Court stating that “ [i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business,” Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938).  These decisions 8 have considered not the formal language of the tax statute but rather its practical effect, and have sustained a tax against Commerce Clause challenge when the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.  Over the years, the Court has applied this practical analysis in approving many types of tax that avoided running afoul of the prohibition against taxing the “privilege of doing business,” but in each instance it has refused to overrule the prohibition.  Under the present state of the law, the Spector rule, as it has come to be known, has no relationship to economic realities.  Rather it stands only as a trap for the unwary draftsman.

 He then approved the tax there at issue because “there is no attempt to tax the privilege of doing an interstate business or to secure anything from the corporation by this statute except compensation for the protection of the enumerated local activities of 'maintaining, keeping in repair, and otherwise in manning the facilities.’ ” Id., at 93 .  Mr. Justice Black concurred in the judgment without opinion.  Id., at 96 .  Mr. Justice Rutledge provided the fifth vote, stating in his concurrence: “[I]t is enough for me to sustain the tax imposed in this case that it is one clearly within the state’s power to lay insofar as any limitation of due process or 'jurisdiction to tax’ in that sense is concerned; it is nondiscriminatory, that is, places no greater burden upon interstate commerce than the state places upon competing intrastate commerce of like character; is duly apportioned, that is, does not undertake to tax any interstate activities carried on outside the state’s borders; and cannot be repeated by any other state.” Id., at 96-97 (footnotes omitted).  Four Justices dissented, id., at 99 , on the grounds that it had not been shown that the State afforded any protection in *283 return for the tax, 12 and that, therefore, the tax must be viewed as one on the “privilege” of engaging in interstate commerce.  The dissenters recognized that an identical effect could be achieved by an increase in the ad valorem property tax, id., at 104 , but would have held, notwithstanding, that a tax on the “privilege” is unconstitutional.  The prohibition against state taxation of the “privilege” of engaging in commerce that is interstate was reaffirmed in Spector Motor Service v. O’Connor, <citedDecision>340 U. S. 602</citedDecision> (1951), a case similar on its facts to the instant case. The taxpayer there was a Missouri corporation engaged exclusively in interstate trucking.  Some of its shipments originated or terminated in Connecticut.  Connecticut imposed on a corporation a “tax or excise upon its franchise for the privilege of carrying on or doing business within the state,” measured by apportioned net income.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 603-604, n. 1</citedDecision> .  Spector brought suit in federal court to enjoin collection of the tax as applied to its activities.  The District Court issued the injunction.  The Second Circuit reversed.  This Court, with three Justices in dissent, in turn reversed the Court of Appeals and held the tax unconstitutional as applied.  The Court recognized that “where a taxpayer is engaged both in intrastate and interstate commerce, a state may tax the privilege of carrying on intrastate business and, within reasonable limits, may compute the amount of the charge by applying the tax rate to a fair proportion of the taxpayer’s business done within the state, including both in *284 terstate and intrastate.” <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 609-610</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  It held, nevertheless, that a tax on the “privilege” of doing business is unconstitutional if applied against what is exclusively interstate commerce.  The dissenters argued, on the other hand, <citedDecision>
   id.,
  
  at 610</citedDecision> , that there is no constitutional difference between an “exclusively interstate” business and a “mixed” business, and that a fairly apportioned and nondiscriminatory tax on either type is not prohibited by the Commerce Clause.  The Spector rule was applied in Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, 347 U. S. 359 (1954) (Railway Express I), to declare unconstitutional a State’s “annual license tax” levied on gross receipts for the “privilege of doing business in this State.” The Court, by a 5-to-4 vote, held that the tax on gross receipts was a tax on the privilege of doing business rather than a tax on property in the State, as Virginia contended.  Virginia thereupon revised the wording of its statute to impose a “franchise tax” on “intangible property” in the form of “going concern” value as measured by gross receipts.  The tax was again asserted against the Agency which in Virginia was engaged exclusively in interstate commerce.  This Court’s opinion, buttressed by two concurring opinions and one concurrence in the result, upheld the reworded statute as not violative of the Spector rule.  Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, 358 U. S. 434 (1959) (Railway Express II).  In upholding the statute, the Court’s opinion recognized that the rule against taxing the “privilege” of doing interstate business had created a situation where “the use of magic words or labels” could “disable an otherwise constitutional levy.” Id., at 441 .

 Nonetheless, the possibility of defending it in the abstract does not alter the fact that the Court has rejected the proposition that interstate commerce is immune from state taxation: “It is a truism that the mere act of carrying on business in interstate commerce does not exempt a corporation from state taxation.  'It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business.’ Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938).” Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U. S., at 108 .  Not only has the philosophy underlying the rule been rejected, but the rule itself has been stripped of any practical significance.  If Mississippi had called its tax one on “net income” or on the “going concern value” of appellant’s business, the Spector rule could not invalidate it.  There is no economic consequence that follows necessarily from the use of the particular words, “privilege of doing business,” and a focus on that formalism merely obscures the question whether the tax produces a forbidden effect.  Simply put, the Spector rule does not address the problems with which the Commerce Clause is concerned.  15 Accordingly, we now reject the rule of *289 Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. <citedDecision>O’Connor</citedDecision> , that a state tax on the “privilege of doing business” is per se unconstitutional when it is applied to interstate commerce, and that case is overruled.  There being no objection to Mississippi’s tax on appellant except that it was imposed on nothing other than the “privilege of doing business” that is interstate, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi is affirmed.  It is so ordered.  1 The statute is now § 27-65-13 of the State’s 1972 Code. 2 This statute is now § 27-65-19 (2) of the 1972 Code. It was amended, effective August 1, 1972, to exclude the transportation of property.  1972 Miss. Laws, c. 506, § 2.  Section 10109, as codified in 1942, imposed a tax on gross income from all transportation, with gross income defined to exclude “so much thereof as is derived from business conducted in commerce between this State and other States of the United States .  .
