**Combined Opinion**
 And we think it clear, that the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it." Ibid. B Thus, for over 125 years, Kentucky v. Dennison has stood for two propositions: first, that the Extradition Clause creates a mandatory duty to deliver up fugitives upon proper demand; and second, that the federal courts have no authority under the Constitution to compel performance of this ministerial duty of delivery.  As to the first of these conclusions, the passage of time has revealed no occasion for doubt.  The language of the Clause is "clear and explicit." Michigan v. *227 Doran, 439 U. S. 282, 286 (1978).  Its mandatory language furthers its intended purposes: "to enable each state to bring offenders to trial as swiftly as possible in the state where the alleged offense was committed," and "to preclude any state from becoming a sanctuary for fugitives from justice of another state." Id., at 287 ; see Biddinger v. Commissioner of Police, <citedDecision>245 U. S. 128, 132-133</citedDecision> (1917); Appleyard v. Massachusetts, 203 U. S. 222, 227 (1906).  The Framers of the Constitution perceived that the frustration of these objectives would create a serious impediment to national unity, and the Extradition Clause responds to that perception.  "It would have been far better to omit it altogether, and to have left it to the comity of the States, and their own sense of their respective interests, than to have inserted it as conferring a right, and yet defining that right so loosely as to make it a never-failing subject of dispute and ill-will." Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How., at 102 .  We reaffirm the conclusion that the commands of the Extradition Clause are mandatory, and afford no discretion to the executive officers or courts of the asylum State.  See California v. Superior Court of California, 482 U. S. 400, 405-406 (1987).  The second, and dispositive, holding of Kentucky v. Dennison rests upon a foundation with which time and the currents of constitutional change have dealt much less favorably.
