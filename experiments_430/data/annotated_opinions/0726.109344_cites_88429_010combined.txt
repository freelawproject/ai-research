 233 Ga. 712 , 214 S. E. 2d 349 (1975).  We granted certiorari, 422 U. S. 1040 (1975).  The only question presented is whether the Georgia Supreme Court was correct in holding that the tires were subject to the ad valorem property tax. [2] We affirm without addressing the question whether the Georgia Supreme Court was correct in holding that the tires had lost their status as imports.  We hold that, in any event, Georgia's assessment of a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax against the imported tires is not within the constitutional prohibition against laying "any Imposts or Duties on Imports.  .  ." and that insofar as Low v. Austin, <citedDecision>13 Wall. 29</citedDecision> (1872) is to the contrary, that decision is overruled.  I Petitioner, a New York corporation qualified to do business in Georgia, operates as an importer and wholesale *280 distributor in the United States of automobile and truck tires and tubes manufactured in France and Nova Scotia by Michelin Tires, Ltd. The business is operated from distribution warehouses in various parts of the country.  Distribution and sale of tires and tubes from the Gwinnett County warehouse is limited to the 250-300 franchised dealers with whom petitioner does all of its business in six southeastern States.  Some 25% of the tires and tubes are manufactured in and imported from Nova Scotia, and are brought to the United States in tractor-driven, over-the-road trailers packed and sealed at the Nova Scotia factory.  The remaining 75% of the imported tires and tubes are brought to the United States by sea from France and Nova Scotia in sea vans packed and sealed at the foreign factories.  Sea vans are essentially over-the-road trailers from which the wheels are removed before being loaded aboard ship.  Upon arrival of the ship at the United States port of entry, the vans are unloaded, the wheels are replaced, and the vans are tractor-hauled to petitioner's distribution warehouse after clearing customs upon payment of a 4% import duty.

 .  ." The Superior Court expressed strong doubts that the ad valorem tax fell within the prohibition but concluded that it was bound by this Court's decisions to the contrary.  The Superior Court stated: "While it would seem that where said tires and tubes have been placed in [petitioner's] general inventory for the purpose of sale to its customers, .  .  .  such inventory should be taxed to the same extent as any other inventory of any other business in Gwinnett County, and the Court would so hold if supported by the law, it is clear that where the property is imported for resale it retains its import exemption from ad valorem taxes until after such sale," "[for] [t]he immunity of imported goods from local taxation includes immunity from local ad valorem property taxes; Hooven & Allison Company v. Evatt, 324 U. S. 652 ; Low v. Austin, <citedDecision>80 U. S. 29</citedDecision> ." Pet. for Cert., App. A-4, A-3.  Similarly, the Georgia Supreme Court stated, 233 Ga., at 722 , 214 S. E. 2d.  at 355: "[Petitioners] argue that an annual ad valorem tax is not a tax on imports within the meaning of *282 the federal constitutional provision.  We reject this argument on the basis of the above-cited authority.  [ E. g., Low v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> .  ]" Low v. <citedDecision>Austin, supra</citedDecision> , is the leading decision of this Court holding that the States are prohibited by the Import-Export Clause from imposing a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax on imported goods until they lose their character as imports and become incorporated into the mass of property in the State.  The Court there reviewed a decision of the California Supreme Court that had sustained the constitutionality of California's nondiscriminatory ad valorem tax on the ground that the Import-Export Clause only prohibited taxes upon the character of the goods as imports and therefore did not prohibit nondiscriminatory taxes upon the goods as property.  See <citedDecision>13 Wall., at 30-31</citedDecision> .  This Court reversed on its reading of the seminal opinion construing the Import-Export Clause, Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419 (1827), as holding that "[w]hilst retaining their character as imports, a tax upon them, in any shape, is within the constitutional prohibition." <citedDecision>13 Wall., at 34</citedDecision> .  Scholarly analysis has been uniformly critical of <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> .  It is true that Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court in Brown v. Maryland, supra, at 442 , said that "while [the thing imported remains] the property of the importer, in his warehouse, in the original form or package in which it was imported, a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports to escape the prohibition in the constitution." Commentators have uniformly agreed that <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> misread this dictum in holding that the Court in Brown included nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes among prohibited "imposts" or "duties," for the contrary conclusion is plainly to be inferred from consideration of the specific abuses which led the Framers to include the Import-Export *283 Clause in the Constitution.  See, e. g., Powell, State Taxation of ImportsWhen Does an Import Cease to Be an Import?, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 858 (1945); Note, The Supreme Court, 1958 Term, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 126 , 176 (1959); Early & Weitzman, A Century of Dissent: The Immunity of Goods Imported for Resale From Non-discriminatory State Personal Property Taxes, 7 Sw. U. L. Rev. 247 (1975); Dakin, The Protective Cloak of the Export-Import Clause: Immunity for the Goods or Immunity for the Process?, 19 La. L. Rev. 747 (1959).  Our independent study persuades us that a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax is not the type of state exaction which the Framers of the Constitution or the Court in Brown had in mind as being an "impost" or "duty" and that <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. Austin's reliance upon the Brown dictum to reach the contrary conclusion was misplaced.  III One of the major defects of the Articles of Confederation, and a compelling reason for the calling of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, was the fact that the Articles essentially left the individual States free to burden commerce both among themselves and with foreign countries very much as they pleased.  Before 1787 it was commonplace for seaboard States with port facilities to derive revenue to defray the costs of state and local governments by imposing taxes on imported goods destined for customers in other States.  At the same time, there was no secure source of revenue for the central government.  James Madison, in his Preface to Debates in the Convention of 1787, 3 M. Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 542 (1911) (hereafter Farrand), provides a graphic description of the situation: "The other source of dissatisfaction was the peculiar situation of some of the States, which having no *284 convenient ports for foreign commerce, were subject to be taxed by their neighbors, thro whose ports, their commerce was carried on.  New Jersey, placed between Phila. & N. York, was likened to a Cask tapped at both ends: and N. Carolina between Virga.  & S. Carolina to a patient bleeding at both Arms.
**Combined Opinion**
 "Imposts" were like customs duties, that is, charges levied on imports at the time and place of importation.  "Duties" was a broader term embracing excises as well as customs duties, and probably only capitation, land, and general property exactions were known by the term "tax" rather than the term "duty." 1 W. Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United States 296-297 (1953).  [12] The characteristic common to both "imposts" *292 and "duties" was that they were exactions directed at imports or commercial activity as such and, as imposed by the seaboard States under the Articles of Confederation, *293 were purposefully employed to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and tax States situated less favorably geographically.  In any event, since prohibition of nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxation would not further the objectives of the Import-Export Clause, only the clearest constitutional mandate should lead us to condemn such taxation.  The terminology employed in the Clause "Imposts or Duties"is sufficiently ambiguous that we decline to presume it was intended to embrace taxation *294 that does not create the evils the Clause was specifically intended to eliminate.  IV The Court in <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> nevertheless expanded the prohibition of the Clause to include nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes, and did so with no analysis, but with only the statement that Brown v. Maryland had marked the line "where the power of Congress over the goods imported ends, and that of the State begins, with as much precision as the subject admits." <citedDecision>13 Wall., at 32</citedDecision> .  But the opinion in Brown v. Maryland cannot properly be read to propose such a broad definition of "imposts" or "duties." The tax there held to be prohibited by the Import-Export Clause was imposed under a Maryland statute that required importers of foreign goods, and wholesalers selling the same by bale or package, to obtain a license and pay a $50 fee therefor, subject to certain forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance.  The importers contested the validity of the statute, arguing that the license was a "palpable evasion" of the Import-Export Clause because it was essentially equivalent to a duty on imports.  They contended that asserted differences between the license fee and a tax directly imposed on imports were more formal than substantial: the privilege of bringing the goods into the country could not realistically be divorced from the privilege of selling the goods, since the power to prohibit sale would be the power to prohibit importation, 12 Wheat., at 422 ; the payment of the tax at the time of sale rather than at the time of importation would be irrelevant since it would still be a tax on the same privilege at either time, id., at 423 ; and the fact that a license operates on the person of the importer while the duty operates on the goods themselves is irrelevant in that either levy would directly increase the cost of the goods, ibid. Since the *295 power to impose a license on importers would also entail a power to price them out of the market or prohibit them entirely, the importers concluded that such a power must be repugnant to the exclusive federal power to regulate foreign commerce, id., at 423-425 .  The Attorney General of Maryland, Roger Taney, later Chief Justice, defended the constitutionality of Maryland's law. He argued that the fee was not a prohibited "impost" or "duty" because the license fee was not a tax upon the imported goods, but on the importers, a tax upon the occupation and nothing more, and the Import-Export Clause prohibited only exactions on the right of importation and not an exaction upon the occupation of importers.  He contended that, in any event, the Clause, if not read as prohibiting only exactions on the right of importation, but, more broadly, as also prohibiting exactions on goods imported, would necessarily immunize imports from all state taxation at any time.

 Id., at 443, 444 .  In contrast, the Maryland exaction in question was a license fee which singled out imports, and therefore was prohibited because "the tax intercepts the import, as an import, in its way to become incorporated with the general mass of property." Id., at 443 .  (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, it is clear that the Court's view in Brown was that merely because certain actions taken by the importer on his imported goods would so mingle them with the common property within the State as to "lose their distinctive character as imports" and render them subject to the taxing power of the State, did not mean that in the absence of such action, no exaction could be imposed on the goods.  Rather, the Court clearly implied that the prohibition would not apply to a state tax that treated imported goods in their original packages no differently from the "common mass of property in the country"; that is, treated it in a manner that did not depend on the foreign origins of the goods.  Despite the language and objectives of the Import-Export Clause, and despite the limited nature of the holding in Brown v. Maryland , the Court in <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> ignored the warning that the boundary between the power of States to tax persons and property within their jurisdictions and the limitations on the power of the States to impose imposts or duties with respect to "imports" was a subtle and difficult line which *299 must be drawn as the cases arise.  <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> also ignored the cautionary remark that; for those reasons, it "might be premature to state any rule as being universal in its application." 12 Wheat., at 441 .  Although it was "sufficient" in the context of Maryland's license tax on the right to sell imported goods to note that a tax imposed directly on imported goods which have not been acted upon in any way would clearly fall within the constitutional prohibition, that observation did not apply, as the foregoing analysis indicates, to a state tax which treated those same goods without regard to the fact of their foreign origin.  Low v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> compounded the error in misreading the Brown opinion by the further error of misreading the views of Mr. Chief Justice Taney as expressed in his opinion in the License Cases, 5 How. 504 (1847) (six Justices wrote separately in the cases).  As already observed, when the Chief Justice was Attorney General of Maryland he argued Brown v. Maryland for the State.  He had argued that the Maryland license fee requirement fell upon the importer, not the imported goods, and therefore fell without the Import-Export Clause's prohibition against imposts or duties on "imports." In the License Cases he observed that "further and more mature reflection has convinced me that the rule laid down [in Brown v. Maryland ] is a just and safe one, and perhaps the best that could have been adopted for preserving the right of the United States on the one hand, and of the States on the other, and preventing collision between them.  The question, I have already said, was a very difficult one for the judicial mind.  In the nature of things, the line of division is in some degree vague and indefinite, and I do not see how it could be drawn more accurately and correctly, or more in harmony with the obvious intention and object of this provision in the *300 constitution.  Indeed, goods imported, while they remain in the hands of the importer, in the form and shape in which they were brought into the country, can in no just sense be regarded as a part of that mass of property in the State usually taxed for the support of the State government." 5 How., at 575 .  Low v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> quoted this excerpt, <citedDecision>13 Wall., at 33-34</citedDecision> , as supporting the holding, <citedDecision>id., at 34</citedDecision> , that "a tax upon [imported goods], in any shape, is within the constitutional prohibition." But Mr. Chief Justice Taney said much more in his opinion in the License Cases , and what he said further makes crystal clear that the prohibition applied only to state exactions upon imports as imports and did not apply to nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes.  For, continuing his analysis in the very paragraph from which <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> excerpted only a part, he concluded: "A tax in any shape .  .  .  cannot be done directly, in the shape of a duty on imports, for that is expressly prohibited.  And as it cannot be done directly, it could hardly be a just and sound construction of the constitution which would enable a State to accomplish precisely the same thing under another name, and in a different form." 5 How., at 576 (emphasis supplied).  The Chief Justice then went on to distinguish an exaction upon imports as imports from property taxes indiscriminately applied to all owners of property, stating, ibid.: "Undoubtedly a State may impose a tax upon its citizens in proportion to the amount they are respectively worth; and the importing merchant is liable to this assessment like any other citizen, and is chargeable according to the amount of his property, whether it consists of money engaged in trade, or of imported goods which he proposes to sell, or any other property of which he is the owner.  *301 But a tax of this description stands upon a very different footing from a tax on the thing imported, while it remains a part of foreign commerce, and is not introduced into the general mass of property in the State." (Emphasis supplied.) Thus Mr. Chief Justice Taney's opinion is authority, precisely contrary to the reading of <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> , that nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes are not prohibited by the Import-Export Clause.  It follows from the foregoing that <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> was wrongly decided.  That decision therefore must be, and is, overruled.  [13] *302 V Petitioner's tires in this case were no longer in transit.  They were stored in a distribution warehouse from which petitioner conducted a wholesale operation, taking orders from franchised dealers and filling them from a constantly replenished inventory.  The warehouse was operated no differently than would be a distribution warehouse utilized by a wholesaler dealing solely in domestic goods, and we therefore hold that the non-discriminatory property tax levied on petitioner's inventory of imported tires was not interdicted by the Import-Export Clause of the Constitution.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia is accordingly Affirmed.  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the judgment.  Being of the view that the goods involved here had lost their character as imports and that subjecting them to ad valorem taxation was consistent with the Constitution as interpreted by prior cases, including Low v. Austin, <citedDecision>13 Wall. 29</citedDecision> (1872), I would affirm the judgment.  There is little reason and no necessity at this time to overrule <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> .  None of the parties has challenged that case here, and the issue of its overruling has not been briefed or argued.  NOTES [*] Curt T. Schneider, Attorney General, and Jonathan P.

[1]  Petitioner's complaint conceded the taxability of certain passenger tubes that had been removed from the original shipping cartons.  These had a value of $633.92 on the assessment date January 1, 1972, and of $664.22 on the assessment date January 1, 1973.  The tax for 1972 on the tubes was $8.03 and for 1973 was $8.73.  [2]  The respondents did not cross-petition from the affirmance of the holding of the Superior Court that the tubes in the corrugated shipping cartons were immune from the tax, and that holding is therefore not before us for review.
**Combined Opinion**
Although the Constitutional Convention had refused to make the Import-Export Clause's prohibition of state exactions absolute, it immediately added that proviso, which Mr. Madison supported "as preventing all State imposts." 2 Farrand 441-442.  See also, e. g., 3 id., at 215-216 (Luther Martin's "Genuine Information").  Of course, Congress presumably could enact other legislation transferring the funds back to the States after they were put to "the Use of the Treasury of the United States." But may Congress consent to state exactions if they are not uniform throughout the United States, since any congressional taxation must conform to the mandate of Art. I, § 8, cl. 1, that "all Duties, Imposts, and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States"?  If Congress may authorize, under the Import-Export Clause, an exaction that it could not directly impose under the Tax Clause, would that not permit Congress to undermine the policies which both Clauses were fashioned to secure?  Since, however, we hold that <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> was not properly decided, there is no occasion to address the question whether Congress could have constitutionally consented to state nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes if they had been within the prohibition of the Import-Export Clause.
