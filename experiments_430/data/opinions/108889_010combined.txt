  Petitioner Board denied a permit to Snyder’s Drug Stores, Inc., because it did not comply with the stock-ownership requirements of the statute, it appearing that all the common stock of Snyder’s was owned by Red Owl Stores and it not being shown if any Red Owl shareholders were pharmacists registered and in good standing in North Dakota. On appeal to the state district court, summary judgment was granted Snyder’s. On appeal to the Supreme Court of North Dakota, that court held

That case involved a Pennsylvania statute that required that 100% of the stock of the corporation be owned by pharmacists. The North Dakota statute, however, requires only that a majority of the stock be owned by pharmacists. But the North Dakota Supreme Court held that the difference did not take this case out from under the

  The finality requirement of <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S.

 </p>
<blockquote id="b311-7">
  “This requirement has the support of considerations generally applicable to good judicial administration. It avoids the mischief of economic waste and of delayed justice. Only in very few situations, where intermediate rulings may carry serious public consequences, has there been a departure from this requirement of finality for federal appellate jurisdiction. This prerequisite to review derives added force when the jurisdiction of this Court is invoked to upset the decision of a State court. Here we are in the realm of potential conflict between the courts of two different governments. And so, ever since 1789, Congress has granted this Court the power to intervene
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="160"> 
   *160

  in State litigation only after 'the highest court of a State in which a decision in the suit could be had’ has rendered a 'final judgment or decree.’ § 237 of the Judicial Code, <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. §344</span> (a). This requirement is not one of those technicalities to be easily scorned. It is an important factor in the smooth working of our federal system.”

  But, as he pointed out, this concept of “finality” has a “penumbral area.”

   <span class="citation no-link">Ibid.</span>
  </em>
  Speaking for the Court in that case, he held that Nebraska’s ruling on the legality of a radio license issued by the Federal Communications Commission could be reviewed even though the state court had not yet determined the final accounting. He stated: “Of course, where the remaining litigation may raise other federal questions that may later come here ... to allow review of an mtermediate adjudication would offend the decisive objection to fragmentary reviews.”

The state court held the act did not violate the Federal Constitution and remanded the case for trial. It was argued that the judgment was not “final” for purposes of <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. § 1257</span>.

  It is equally important that we treat the judgment in the instant case as “final,” for we have discovered no way which the licensing authority in North Dakota has of preserving the constitutional question now ripe for decision.
 </p>
<p id="b314-6">
  The Board here denied respondent’s application without an evidentiary hearing since the application showed that under the North Dakota Act respondent could in no way qualify for a license. The State Supreme Court held that Act unconstitutional and that thus an applicant failing to meet the requirements of the state statute is nevertheless entitled to consideration for a license. As previously noted, the State Supreme Court, indeed, directed the Board on remand to reconsider the application
  <em>
   “sans”
  </em>
  the constitutional question.
 </p>
<p id="b314-7">
  There were state law questions to be considered on the remand, for the state board had also rested its denial of a permit on the failure of Snyder’s to meet certain structural and safety standards. The Supreme Court
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="163"> 
   *163
   </span>
  remanded for an administrative hearing on those other issues.

<p id="b315-4">
  If we deny review at this point, respondent has no constitutional barrier to the grant of a license.

<p id="b315-5">
  The state licensing authority might, of course, after an administrative hearing reinstate its earlier findings that the respondent does not meet the necessary structural and safety standards. If' respondent is denied a license for that reason, the denial will obviously be on a state ground. If respondent is granted a license, the battle over the constitutionality of the new Act will be lost as far as this case is concerned.

  For in those cases the federal constitutional question embraces not only a taking, but a taking on payment of just compensation. A state judgment is not final unless it covers both aspects of that integral problem. See

  It would appear that, as
  <em>
   &amp;
  </em>
  matter of North Dakota procedure, the only way in which the Board could preserve the constitutional issue would be to defy its own State Supreme Court and deny the application on the ground of failure to meet the ownership requirement. The state Administrative Agencies Practice Act provides that: “Any party to any proceeding heard by an administrative agency” may appeal from the decision of the agency. N. D. Cent. Code § 28-32-15. The statute appears to treat the agency as a tribunal and not as a “party” able to appeal its own order.
 </p>
<p id="b315-8">
  If the Board thus grants the license in accordance with the State Supreme Court decision and then seeks to appeal its own grant on the basis of the validity of the state ownership requirement, the appeal may well be
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="164"> 
   *164

  dismissed and the dismissal would rest on the independent state ground that state procedural law does not provide the agency the right to appeal.

He moved that we dismiss the State's petition, which we had granted, for lack of a “final” judgment. We noted, however, that if on a retrial he were acquitted, there was no appeal available to the State. We therefore held that the judgment under review was “final” for our purposes.

We held that the issue of guilt was quite independent of the issue of punishment and that it was time to decide the due process and/or equal protection questions presented by the state decision.
