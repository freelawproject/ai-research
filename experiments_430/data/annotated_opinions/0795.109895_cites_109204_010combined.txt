**Combined Opinion**
 In our first encounter with the new statute, we concluded that "Congress intended to remove all statutory barriers to Government appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit." United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 337 (1975).  Since up to that point Government appeals had been subject to statutory restrictions independent of the Double Jeopardy Clause, our previous cases construing the statute proved to be of little assistance in determining when the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment would *86 prohibit further prosecution.  A detailed canvass of the history of the double jeopardy principles in English and American law led us to conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause was primarily "directed at the threat of multiple prosecutions," and posed no bar to Government appeals "where those appeals would not require a new trial." Id., at 342 .  We accordingly held in Jenkins, supra, at 370 , that, whether or not a dismissal of an indictment after jeopardy had attached amounted to an acquittal on the merits, the Government had no right to appeal, because "further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand." [2] If Jenkins is a correct statement of the law, the judgment of the Court of Appeals relying on that decision, as it was bound to do, would in all likelihood have to be affirmed.  [3] Yet, though our assessment of the history and meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause in Wilson, Jenkins, and Serfass v. United States, <citedDecision>420 U. S. 377</citedDecision> (1975), occurred only three Terms ago, our vastly increased exposure to the various facets of the Double Jeopardy Clause has now convinced us that Jenkins *87 was wrongly decided.  It placed an unwarrantedly great emphasis on the defendant's right to have his guilt decided by the first jury empaneled to try him so as to include those cases where the defendant himself seeks to terminate the trial before verdict on grounds unrelated to factual guilt or innocence.  We have therefore decided to overrule Jenkins , and thus to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case. II The origin and history of the Double Jeopardy Clause are hardly a matter of dispute.  See generally Wilson, supra, at 339-340 ; Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187-188 (1957); id., at 200 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  The constitutional provision had its origin in the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon.  These three pleas prevented the retrial of a person who had previously been acquitted, convicted, or pardoned for the same offense.  As this Court has described the purpose underlying the prohibition against double jeopardy: "The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty."

 Jenkins, 420 U. S., at 370 , held that, regardless of the character of the midtrial termination, appeal was barred if "further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand." However, only last Term, in Lee, supra, the Government was permitted to institute a second prosecution after a midtrial dismissal of an indictment.  The Court found the circumstances presented by that case "functionally indistinguishable from a declaration of mistrial." 432 U. S., at 31 .  Thus, Lee demonstrated that, at least in some cases, the dismissal of an indictment may be treated on the same basis as the declaration of a mistrial.  *95 In the present case, the District Court's dismissal of the first count of the indictment was based upon a claim of preindictment delay and not on the court's conclusion that the Government had not produced sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the defendant.  Respondent Scott points out quite correctly that he had moved to dismiss the indictment on this ground prior to trial, and that had the District Court chosen to grant it at that time the Government could have appealed the ruling under our holding in Serfass v. United States, <citedDecision>420 U. S. 377</citedDecision> (1975).  He also quite correctly points out that jeopardy had undeniably "attached" at the time the District Court terminated the trial in his favor; since a successful Government appeal would require further proceedings in the District Court leading to a factual resolution of the issue of guilt or innocence, Jenkins bars the Government's appeal.  However, our growing experience with Government appeals convinces us that we must re-examine the rationale of Jenkins in light of Lee, Martin Linen, and other recent expositions of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  IV Our decision in Jenkins was based upon our perceptions of the underlying purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, see supra, at 87: "`The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity .  .  .  .'"

United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783, 789 (1977), quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 326 (1971); see United States v. MacDonald, 435 U. S. 850, 858, 858-859 (1978).  Here, therefore, the District Court, quite properly, deferred consideration of the respondent's pretrial motion to dismiss for preaccusation delay until trial. At the close of the evidence, respondent renewed his motion.  The District Court recognized that there was sufficient evidence of guilt to permit submission of count one to the jury, but granted the motion as to this count because, evaluating the facts adduced at trial, the court found that the delay between the offense alleged and respondent's indictment had been unjustifiable and had so prejudiced respondent's ability to present his defense as to constitute a denial of due process of law. A critical feature of today's holding appears to be the Court's definition of acquittal as "`a resolution [in the defendant's favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,'" ante, at 97, quoting United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S., at 571 .  But this definition, which is narrower than the traditional one, enjoys no significant support in our prior decisions.  The language quoted from Martin Linen Supply Co. was tied to the particular *112 issue in that case and was never intended to serve as an all-encompassing definition of acquittal for all purposes.  Rather, Martin Linen Supply referred generally to "acquittal" as "a legal determination on the basis of facts adduced at the trial relating to the general issue of the case," id., at 575 (citations omitted), and this is the accepted definition.  See Serfass v. United States, <citedDecision>420 U. S. 377, 393</citedDecision> (1975), quoting United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267 , 290 n. 19 (1970).  This definition, moreover, clearly encompasses rulings pertaining to all "affirmative defenses" that depend on the factual development at trial. The traditional definition of "acquittal" obviously is responsive to the values protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  While it perhaps might not be objectionable to permit retrial of a defendant whose first trial was terminated on the basis of a midtrial ruling on a motion that could because it did not depend upon the facts adduced at trialhave been raised before jeopardy attached, see <citedDecision>Serfass</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 394, [8] it would be intolerable to permit the retrial of a defendant whose first prosecution ended on the basis of a rulinglike the one in the present casewhich could only be made after the factual development at trial. Notably, the Court neither explains why it chooses to reject the more traditional definition of "acquittal" nor attempts to justify its more restrictive definition in terms of the constitutional policy against multiple trials.  But I will not dwell further on this point.  As the Court opinion itself demonstrates, what is perhaps as important as the actual definition is how it is applied.  The pertinent question, thus, is one the Court never addresses: Why, for purposes *113 of its new definition of "acquittal," is not the fact vel non of preindictment delay one of the "factual elements of the offense charged"?  The Court plainly cannot answer that preindictment delay is not referred to in the statutory definition of the offense charged in count one, cf. Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977), for it states that dismissals based on the defenses of insanity [9] and entrapmentneither of which is bound up with the statutory definition of federal crimeswill constitute "acquittals." Ante, at 97-98.  How can decisions based on the trial evidence that a defendant is "not guilty by reason of insanity" or "not guilty by reason of entrapment" erect a double jeopardy bar, and a decisionequally based on evaluation of the trial evidence that the defendant is "not guilty by reason of preaccusation delay" not also prohibit further prosecution?

 [5]  By "final judgment favorable to the accused," I am, of course, referring to an order terminating all prosecution of the defendant on the ground he "simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged." See Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, 30 (1977).  [6]  Similarly unpersuasive is the Court's suggestion that its holding is supported by the well-recognized rules that a criminal defendant may twice be tried for the same offense if he either successfully moved for a mistrial at the first trial, see Lee, supra ; United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600 (1976), or succeeded in having a conviction set aside on a ground other than the insufficiency of the evidence.  See United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896).  What distinguishes these situations, of course, is that neither involved a final judgment entered for the accused and that in both the Government could not be said to have had a complete opportunity to convict the accused.  [7]  The Court's suggestion that intervening decisions have somehow undermined Jenkins simply will not wash. Although it is quite true that the author of the Court opinion has stated that he understood Jenkins to embrace a rule that any midtrial termination that is labeled a "dismissal" erects a double jeopardy bar, see ante, at 86 n. 2, quoting Lee, 432 U. S., at 36 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring), no Court opinion has adopted the position that the label attached to a trial court's ruling could be determinative.  Indeed, since Serfass v. United States, <citedDecision>420 U. S. 377, 392</citedDecision> (1975), which was decided the week after Jenkins , explicitly provides that labels are not to have such talismanic significance, the unanimous Court in Jenkins could scarcely have contemplated that it had announced such a mechanical formula.  Thus, the Court's suggestion, see ante, at 94, that Lee , which held that a termination that was labeled a "dismissal" did not erect a double jeopardy bar, could have undermined Jenkins is unpersuasive on its face.  In Lee , we treated the dismissal as the equivalent of a mistrial because both the trial judge and the parties had so regarded it.  See 432 U. S., at 29.  [8]  In <citedDecision>Serfass</citedDecision> , we reserved decision on the question whether a defendant who was afforded an opportunity to obtain a determination of a legal defense prior to trial but who nevertheless knowingly allowed himself to be placed in jeopardy before raising the defense could claim the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  420 U. S., at 394.  [9]  A contrary position would not only be inconsistent with Burks v. United States, ante, p. 1, but would also have untoward consequences for criminal defendants.  The premise of such a ruling would necessarily be that a criminal defendant has no legitimate interest in protecting the finality of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.  It would then follow that there could be appellate review not only of all directed verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity, but also of all jury verdicts that had been preceded by a prior finding of guilt of the statutory offense.  The implications of such a holding would be particularly significant in jurisdictions providing for bifurcated determinations of guilt and sanity.  [10]  In any case in which the date upon which the defendant committed the crime is disputed and may have been outside the statute of limitations provided by law, a trial judge could, and probably would, submit this question to the jury along with the general issue.
