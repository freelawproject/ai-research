 Childers v. Beaver, supra, was in effect overruled by the Mountain Producers decision.  The immunity formerly said to rest on constitutional implication cannot now be resurrected in the form of statutory implication.  The cash and securities of which these estates are almost entirely composed were restricted by the Act of January 27,1933.  6 Unless the tax immunity is granted by the restriction clause itself, there is not a word in the Act which even remotely suggests that Congress meant to exempt Indians’ cash and securities from Oklahoma’s estate taxes.  We conclude that this Act does not exempt the restricted property from taxation for two reasons: (1) the legislative history of the Act refutes the contention that an exemption was intended; and (2) application of the normal rule against tax exemption by statutory implication prevents our reading such an implication into the Act.  The 1933 Act was intended to serve two purposes relevant to this case. One was to continue the restrictions on Indian property for the purpose of protecting the Indians from loss to individuals who might take advantage of them; and the other was to preserve the status of certain *605 Indian land as non-taxable until 1956.  See the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Rutledge in Board of Commissioners v. Seber, <citedDecision>318 U. S. 705, 719</citedDecision> .  This Act was before two Congresses, the 71st and the 72d.  It was the subject of exhaustive debate, as well as of several committee reports, and there is no indication whatever in all that discussion of an intention to exempt Indians from estate taxes.  7 The bill was sponsored by Oklahoma Congressmen who said nothing which supports the imputation that they intended to deprive their State of this income.  It was described by its sponsor, Congressman Hastings, as follows: “You ask me what the bill does.  If the Members of Congress understood the bill there would not be a vote against it.  Oil has been struck underneath some of the lands allotted to the members of these tribes.

 Assessed value: $677,000.  No. 625: 160 acres of allotted restricted land; 160 acres of inherited restricted land; a four-fifths interest in 40 acres; an automobile; miscellaneous property, and insurance; restricted cash and securities.  Assessed value: $318,000.  Ch. 162, Sess. Laws, 1915: Ch. 66, Art. 5, Sess. Laws.  1935.  It is unnecessary to consider the State’s argument that Congress is without power to exempt these estates from taxation.  This issue is not foreclosed by Board of Commissioners v. Seber, <citedDecision>318 U. S. 705</citedDecision> , since there we decided no more than that Congress might authorize the exemption of certain Indian lands from taxation because of an historic policy in respect to those lands.  Cf. McCurdy v. United States, 246 U.S. 263, 269 .  Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665 , holding that under certain circumstances the United States could not withdraw a tax exemption once assured, has no bearing on the instant problem since it is conceded that the question here is entirely one of what Congress has in fact directed.

C. § 501 et seq., some progress has been made in the restoration of tribal government.  Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law, 455, 129-133, 142-143.  47 Stat. 777 .
