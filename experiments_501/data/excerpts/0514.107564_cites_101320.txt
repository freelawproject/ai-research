 But what he sought to exclude when he entered the booth was not the intruding eye — it was the uninvited ear.  He did not shed his right to do so simply because he made his calls from a place where he might be seen.  No less than an individual in a business office, 10 in a friend’s apartment, 11 or in a taxicab, 12 a person in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the Fourth Amendment.  One who occupies it, shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world.  To read the Constitution more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the public telephone has come to play in private communication.  The Government contends, however, that the activities of its agents in this case should not be tested by Fourth Amendment requirements, for the surveillance technique they employed involved no physical penetration of the telephone booth from which the petitioner placed his calls.  It is true that the absence of such penetration was at one time thought to foreclose further Fourth Amendment inquiry, Olmstead v. United States, <citedDecision>277 U. S. 438, 457, 464, 466</citedDecision> ; Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129, 134-136 , for that Amendment was thought to limit only searches and seizures of tangible *353 property.  13 But “[t]he premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.” Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 304 .  Thus, although a closely divided Court supposed in <citedDecision>Olmstead</citedDecision> that surveillance without any trespass and without the seizure of any material object fell outside the ambit of the Constitution, we have since departed from the narrow view on which that decision rested.  Indeed, we have expressly held that the Fourth Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements, overheard without any “technical trespass under .  .  .  local property law.” Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511 .  Once this much is acknowledged, and once it is recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects people— and not simply “areas” — against unreasonable searches and seizures, it becomes clear that the reach of that Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure.  We conclude that the underpinnings of <citedDecision>Olmstead</citedDecision> and Goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the “trespass” doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling.  The Government’s activities in electronically listening to and recording the petitioner’s words violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied while using the telephone booth and thus constituted a “search and seizure” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  The fact that the electronic device employed to achieve that end did not happen to penetrate the wall of the booth can have no constitutional significance.  *354 The question remaining for decision, then, is whether the search and seizure conducted in this case complied with constitutional standards.  In that regard, the Government’s position is that its agents acted in an entirely defensible manner: They did not begin their electronic surveillance until investigation of the petitioner’s activities had established a strong probability that he was using the telephone in question to transmit gambling information to persons in other States, in violation of federal law. Moreover, the surveillance was limited, both in scope and in duration, to the specific purpose of establishing the contents of the petitioner’s unlawful telephonic communications.  The agents confined their surveillance to the brief periods during which he used the telephone booth, 14 and they took great care to overhear only the conversations of the petitioner himself.  15 Accepting this account of the Government’s actions as accurate, it is clear that this surveillance was so narrowly circumscribed that a duly authorized magistrate, properly notified of the need for such investigation, specifically informed of the basis on which it was to proceed, and clearly apprised of the precise intrusion it would entail, could constitutionally have authorized, with appropriate safeguards, the very limited search and seizure that the Government asserts in fact took place.  Only last Term we sustained the validity of *355 such an authorization, holding that, under sufficiently “precise and discriminate circumstances,” a federal court may empower government agents to employ a concealed electronic device “for the narrow and particularized purpose of ascertaining the truth of the .  .  .  allegations” of a “detailed factual affidavit alleging the commission of a specific criminal offense.” Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323, 329-330 .  Discussing that holding, the Court in Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41 , said that “the order authorizing the use of the electronic device” in Osborn “afforded similar protections to those ... of conventional warrants authorizing the seizure of tangible evidence.” Through those protections, “no greater invasion of privacy was permitted than was necessary under the circumstances.” Id., at 57.  16 Here, too, a similar *356 judicial order could have accommodated “the legitimate needs of law enforcement” 17 by authorizing the carefully limited use of electronic surveillance.  The Government urges that, because its agents relied upon the decisions in <citedDecision>Olmstead</citedDecision> and Goldman , and because they did no more here than they might properly have done with prior judicial sanction, we should retroactively validate their conduct.  That we cannot do.  It is apparent that the agents in this case acted with restraint.  Yet the inescapable fact is that this restraint was imposed by the agents themselves, not by a judicial officer.  They were not required, before commencing the search, to present their estimate of probable cause for detached scrutiny by a neutral magistrate.  They were not compelled, during the conduct of the search itself, to observe precise limits established in advance by a specific court order.  Nor were they directed, after the search had been completed, to notify the authorizing magistrate in detail of all that had been seized.

 Defending the inclusion of a telephone booth in his fist the petitioner cites United States v. Stone, 232 F. Supp. 396 , and United States v. Madison, 32 L. W. 2243 (D. C. Ct. Gen. Sess.).  Urging that the telephone booth should be excluded, the Government finds support in United States v. Borgese, 235 F. Supp. 286 .  It is true that this Court has occasionally described its conclusions in terms of “constitutionally protected areas,” see, e. g., Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 510, 512 ; Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 438-439 ; Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, 57, 59 , but we have never suggested that this concept can serve as a talismanic solution to every Fourth Amendment problem.  Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385 .  Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257 .  Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253 .  See Olmstead v. United States, <citedDecision>277 U. S. 438, 464-466</citedDecision> .  We do not deal in this case with the law of detention or arrest under the Fourth Amendment.  Based upon their previous visual observations of the petitioner, the agents correctly predicted that he would use the telephone booth for several minutes at approximately the same time each morning.  The petitioner was subjected to electronic surveillance only during this predetermined period.  Six recordings, averaging some three minutes each, were obtained and admitted in evidence.  They preserved the petitioner’s end of conversations concerning the placing of bets and the receipt of wagering information.  On the single occasion when the statements of another person were inadvertently intercepted, the agents refrained from listening to them.

 Under these circumstances it strikes me as a charge against their scholarship, their common sense and their candor to give to the Fourth Amendment’s language the eavesdropping meaning the Court imputes to it today.  I do not deny that common sense requires and that this Court often has said that the Bill of Rights’ safeguards should be given a liberal construction.  This *367 principle, however, does not justify construing the search and seizure amendment as applying to eavesdropping or the “seizure” of conversations.  The Fourth Amendment was aimed directly at the abhorred practice of breaking in, ransacking and searching homes and other buildings and seizing people’s personal belongings without warrants'issued by magistrates.  The Amendment deserves, and this Court has given it, a liberal construction in order to protect against warrantless searches of buildings and seizures of tangible personal effects.  But until today this Court has refused to say that eavesdropping comes within the ambit of Fourth Amendment restrictions.  See, e. g., Olmstead v. United States, <citedDecision>277 U. S. 438</citedDecision> (1928), and Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129 (1942).  So far I have attempted to state why I think the words of the Fourth Amendment prevent its application to eavesdropping.  It is important now to show that this has been the traditional view of the Amendment’s scope since its adoption and that the Court’s decision in this case, along with its amorphous holding in Berger last Term, marks the first real departure from that view.  The first case to reach this Court which actually involved a clear-cut test of the Fourth Amendment’s applicability to eavesdropping through a wiretap was, of course, Olmstead, su-pra.  In holding that the interception of private telephone conversations by means of wiretapping was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, this Court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Taft, examined the language of the Amendment and found, just as I do now, that the words could not be stretched to encompass overheard conversations: “The Amendment itself shows that the search is to be of material things — the person, the house, his papers or his effects.  The description of the warrant necessary to make the proceeding lawful, is *368 that it must specify the place to be searched and the person or things to be seized.  .  .  .  “Justice Bradley in the Boyd case [Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616 ], and Justice Clark[e] in the Gouled case [Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S. 298 ], said that the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment were to be liberally construed to effect the purpose of the framers of the Constitution in the interest of liberty.  But that can not justify enlargement of the language employed beyond the possible practical meaning of houses, persons, papers, and effects, or so to apply the words search and seizure as to forbid hearing or sight.” <citedDecision>277 U. S., at 464-465</citedDecision> .  Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129 , is an even clearer example of this Court’s traditional refusal to consider eavesdropping as being covered by the Fourth Amendment.  There federal agents used a detectaphone, which was placed on the wall of an adjoining room, to listen to the conversation of a defendant carried on in his private office and intended to be confined within the four walls of the room.  This Court, referring to Olmstead, found no Fourth Amendment violation.  It should be noted that the Court in Olmstead based its decision squarely on the fact that wiretapping or eavesdropping does not violate the Fourth Amendment.  As shown, supra, in the cited quotation from the case, the Court went to great pains to examine the actual language of the Amendment and found that the words used simply could not be stretched to cover eavesdropping.  That there was no trespass was not the determinative factor, and indeed the Court in citing Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 , indicated that even where there was a trespass the Fourth Amendment does not automatically apply to evidence obtained by “hearing or *369 sight.” The Olmstead majority characterized Hester as holding “that the testimony of two officers of the law who trespassed on the defendant’s land, concealed themselves one hundred yards away from his house and saw him come out and hand a bottle of whiskey to another, was not inadmissible.  While there was a trespass, there was no search of person, house, papers or effects.” <citedDecision>277 U. S., at 465</citedDecision> .  Thus the clear holding of the Olmstead and Goldman cases, undiluted by any question of trespass, is that eavesdropping, in both its original and modern forms, is not violative of the Fourth Amendment.  While my reading of the Olmstead and Goldman cases convinces me that they were decided on the basis of the inapplicability of the wording of the Fourth Amendment to eavesdropping, and not on any trespass basis, this is not to say that unauthorized intrusion has not played an important role in search and seizure cases. This Court has adopted an exclusionary rule to bar evidence obtained by means of such intrusions.  As I made clear in my dissenting opinion in Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, 76 , I continue to believe that this exclusionary rule formulated in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 , rests on the “supervisory power” of this Court over other federal courts and is not rooted in the Fourth Amendment.  See Wolf v. Colorado, concurring opinion, 338 U. S. 25, 39 , at 40.  See also Mapp v. Ohio, concurring opinion, 367 U. S. 643, 661-666 .  This rule has caused the Court to refuse to accept evidence where there has been such an intrusion regardless of whether there has been a search or seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
