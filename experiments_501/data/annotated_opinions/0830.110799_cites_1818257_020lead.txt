 The State “finds itself in possession of what all admit to be a great public good, and what it has it may keep and give no one a reason for its will.” Id., at 357 .  Having disposed of the just compensation claim, Justice Holmes turned very briefly to the other constitutional chal *947 lenges.  In one paragraph, he rejected the Contract Clause claim.  In the remaining paragraph of the opinion, he rejected all the other defenses.  His treatment of the Commerce Clause challenge consists of three sentences: “A man cannot acquire a right to property by his desire to use it in commerce among the States.  Neither can he enlarge his otherwise limited and qualified right to the same end.  The case is covered in this respect by Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 [(1896)].” Ibid. While appellee relies upon Hudson County, appellants rest on our summary affirmance of a three-judge District Court judgment in City of Altus v. Carr, <citedDecision>255 F. Supp. 828</citedDecision> (WD Tex.), summarily aff’d, 385 U. S. 35 (1966).  The city of Altus is located near the southern border of Oklahoma.  Large population increases rendered inadequate its source of municipal water.  It consequently obtained from the owners of land in an adjoining Texas county the contractual right to pump the ground water underlying that land and to transport it across the border.  The Texas Legislature thereafter enacted a statute that forbade the interstate exportation of ground water without the approval of that body.  7 The city filed suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the statute violated the Commerce Clause.  The city relied upon West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State, 8 and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923), which invalidated a West Virginia statute *948 that accorded a preference to the citizens of that State in the purchase of natural gas produced therein.

 The District Court rejected that defense because similar conservation claims had met defeat in West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., supra, and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, supra. 10 Second, the State argued that the statute regulated ground water and that ground water is not an article of commerce, citing Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 (1896), and Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, 209 U. S. 349 (1908).  The court rejected this argument since the statute directly regulated the interstate transportation of *949 water that had been pumped from the ground, and under Texas law such water was an article of commerce.  The court then had little difficulty in concluding that the statute imposed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.  11 In summarily affirming the District Court in City of Altus, we did not necessarily adopt the court’s reasoning.  Our affirmance indicates only our agreement with the result reached by the District Court. Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 499 (1981).  That result is not necessarily inconsistent with the Nebraska Supreme Court’s holding in this case. For Texas law differs significantly from Nebraska law regarding the rights of a surface owner to ground water that he has withdrawn.  According to the District Court in City ofAltus, the “rule in Texas was that an owner of land could use all of the percolating water he could capture from the wells on his land for whatever beneficial purposes he needed it, on or off the land, and could likewise sell it to others for use on or off the land and outside the basin where produced, just as he could sell any other species of property.” <citedDecision>255 F. Supp., at 833, n. 8</citedDecision> .  Since ground water, once withdrawn, may be freely bought and sold in States that follow this rule, in those States ground water is appropriately re *950 garded as an article of commerce.  In Nebraska the surface owner has no comparable interest in ground water.  As explained by the Nebraska Supreme Court, “ ‘the owner of land is entitled to appropriate subterranean waters found under his land, but he cannot extract and appropriate them in excess of a reasonable and beneficial use upon the land which he owns, especially if such use is injurious to others who have substantial rights to the waters, and if the natural underground supply is insufficient for all owners, each is entitled to a reasonable proportion of the whole.’” 208 Neb., at 705 , 305 N. W. 2d, at 617 (quoting Olson v. City of Wahoo, 124 Neb. 802, 811 , 248 N. W. 304, 308 (1933)).  City of Altus, however, is inconsistent with Hudson County.  For in the latter case the Court found Geer v. Connecticut, supra, to be controlling on the Commerce Clause issue.  Geer , which sustained a Connecticut ban on the interstate transportation of game birds captured in that State, was premised on the theory that the State owned its wild animals and therefore was free to qualify any ownership interest it might recognize in the persons who capture them.

 “The Courts below assumed or decided and we shall assume that the defendant represents the rights of a riparian proprietor, and on the other hand, that it represents no special chartered powers that give it greater rights than those.  On these assumptions the Court of Errors and Appeals pointed out that a riparian proprietor has no right to divert waters for more than a reasonable distance from the body of the stream or for other than the well-known ordinary uses, and that for any purpose anywhere he is narrowly limited in amount.  It went on to infer that his only right in the body of the stream is to have the flow continue, and that there is a residuum of public ownership in the State.  It reinforced the State’s rights by the State’s title to the bed of the stream where flowed-by the tide, and concluded from the foregoing and other considerations that, as against the rights of riparian owners merely as such, the State was warranted in prohibiting the acquisition of the title to water on a larger scale.” Id., at 354 .  “The problems of irrigation have no place here.  Leaving them on one side, it appears to us that few public interests are more obvious, indisputable and independent of particular theory than the interest of the public of a State to maintain the rivers that are wholly within it substantially undiminished, except by such drafts upon them as the guardian of the public welfare may permit for the purpose of turning them to a more perfect use.” Id., at 356 .  The District Court quoted the statute: ‘“No one shall withdraw water from any underground source in this State for use in any other state by drilling a well in Texas and transporting the water outside the boundaries of the State unless the same be specifically authorized by an Act of the Texas Legislature and thereafter as approved by it.’” <citedDecision>255 F. Supp., at 830</citedDecision> .  Justiee Holmes, the author of the Court’s opinion in Hudson County, noted his dissent.  See 221 U. S., at 262 .  Justice Holmes dissented, expressing the view that the Court’s decision was inconsistent with Hudson County.  See 262 U. S., at 603 .  The District Court opinion, <citedDecision>255 F. Supp., at 839</citedDecision> , included these quotations from the two cases: “The statute of Oklahoma recognizes [natural gas] to be a subject of intrastate commerce, but seeks to prohibit it from being the subject of interstate commerce, and this is the purpose of its conservation.  In other words, the purpose of its conservation is in a sense commercial — the business welfare of the State, as coal might be, or timber.  Both of these products might be limited in amount, and the same consideration of the public welfare which would confine gas to the use of the inhabitants of a State would confine them to the inhabitants of the State.  If the States have such power a singular situation might result.  Pennsylvania might keep its coal, the Northwest its timber, the mining States their minerals.  And why may not the products of the field be brought within the principle?” West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S., at 255 .  “Another consideration advanced to the same end is that natural gas is a natural product of the State and has become a necessity therein, that the supply is waning and no longer sufficient to satisfy local needs and be used abroad, and that the act is therefore a legitimate measure of conservation in the interest of the people of the State.  If the situation be as stated, it affords no ground for the assumption by the State of the power to regulate interstate commerce, which is what the act attempts to do.  That power is lodged elsewhere.” Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S., at 598 .  “Considering the statute in question only with regard to whether it regulates the transportation and use of water after it has been withdrawn from a well and becomes personal property, such statute constitutes an unreasonable burden upon and interference with interstate commerce.  Moreover, on the facts of this case it appear[s] to us that [the Texas statute] does not have for its purpose, nor does it operate to conserve water resources of the State of Texas except in the sense that it does so for her own benefit to the detriment of her sister States as in the case of West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. In the name of conservation, the statute seeks to prohibit interstate shipments of water while indulging in the substantial discrimination of permitting the unrestricted intrastate production and transportation of water between points within the State, no matter how distant; for example, from Wilbarger County to El Paso County, Texas.  Obviously, the statute had little relation to the cause of conservation.” <citedDecision>255 F. Supp., at 839-840</citedDecision> .  “This statute, however, seeks to prohibit the production of underground water for the purpose of transporting same in interstate commerce, and has the effect of prohibiting the interstate transportation of such water after it has become personal property.  Whether a statute by its phraseology prohibits the interstate transportation of an article of commerce after it has become the personal property of someone as in the Pennsylvania and West cases, or prohibits the withdrawal of such substance where the intent *951 is to transport such in interstate commerce, the result upon interstate commerce is the same.  In both situations, the purpose and intent of the statute and the end result thereof is to prohibit the interstate transportation of an article of commerce.” <citedDecision>Id., at 840</citedDecision> .  In California v. United States, 438 U. S. 645, 648 (1978), we explained some of the circumstances that support a general policy of local water management under differing legal systems: “The very vastness of our territory as a Nation, the different times at which it was acquired and settled, and the varying physiographic and climate regimes which obtain in its different parts have all but necessitated the recognition of legal distinctions corresponding to these differences.  Those who first set foot in North America from ships sailing the tidal estuaries of Virginia did not confront the same problems as those who sailed flat boats down the Ohio River in search of new sites to farm.  Those who cleared the forests in the old Northwest Territory faced totally different physiographic problems from those who built sod huts on the Great Plains.  The final expansion of our Nation in the 19th century into the arid lands beyond the hundredth meridian of longitude, which had been shown on early maps as the ‘Great American Desert,’ brought the participants in *953 that expansion face to face with the necessity for irrigation in a way that no previous territorial expansion had.” Soil Conservation Service, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, America’s Soil and Water: Conditions and Trends 21 (1980).  Comptroller General, Report to Congress, Ground Water Overdrafting Must Be Controlled 7-8 (1980).  See Cities Service Gas Co. v. Peerless Oil & Gas Co., 340 U. S. 179, 188 (1950) (“Insofar as conservation is concerned, the national interest and the interest of producing states may well tend to coincide”).
