 Supreme Court of United States.  Argued November 13, 1969 Decided April 6, 1970 CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.  *437 Clark M. Clifford, by appointment of the Court, 394 U. S. 941 , argued the cause for petitioner.  With him on the briefs were James T. Stovall III and Robert G. Duncan.  Gene E. Voigts, First Assistant Attorney General of Missouri, argued the cause for respondent.  With him on the brief was John C. Danforth, Attorney General.  MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court. In Benton v. Maryland, <citedDecision>395 U. S. 784</citedDecision> , the Court held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  The question in this case is whether the State of Missouri violated that guarantee when it prosecuted the petitioner a second time for armed robbery in the circumstances here presented.  [1] Sometime in the early hours of the morning of January 10, 1960, six men were engaged in a poker game in the basement of the home of John Gladson at Lee's Summit, Missouri.  Suddenly three or four masked men, armed with a shotgun and pistols, broke into the basement and robbed each of the poker players of money and various articles of personal property.  The robbers and it has never been clear whether there were three or four of themthen fled in a car belonging to one of the victims of the robbery.  Shortly thereafter the stolen car was discovered in a field, and later that morning three men were arrested by a state trooper while they were walking on a highway not far from where the abandoned car had been found. The petitioner was arrested by another officer some distance away.  *438 The four were subsequently charged with seven separate offensesthe armed robbery of each of the six poker players and the theft of the car. In May 1960 the petitioner went to trial on the charge of robbing Donald Knight, one of the participants in the poker game.
**Combined Opinion**
 After appeals in the state courts proved unsuccessful, Hoag brought his case here.  Viewing the question presented solely in terms of Fourteenth Amendment due processwhether the course that New Jersey had pursued had "led to fundamental unfairness," 356 U. S., at 467this Court declined to reverse the judgment of conviction, because "in the circumstances shown by this record, we cannot say that *442 petitioner's later prosecution and conviction violated due process." [6] 356 U. S., at 466 .  The Court found it unnecessary to decide whether "collateral estoppel"the principle that bars relitigation between the same parties of issues actually determined at a previous trialis a due process requirement in a state criminal trial, since it accepted New Jersey's determination that the petitioner's previous acquittal did not in any event give rise to such an estoppel.  356 U. S., at 471 .  And in the view the Court took of the issues presented, it did not, of course, even approach consideration of whether collateral estoppel is an ingredient of the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy.  The doctrine of Benton v. Maryland, <citedDecision>395 U. S. 784</citedDecision> , puts the issues in the present case in a perspective quite different from that in which the issues were perceived in Hoag v. New Jersey, supra .  The question is no longer whether collateral estoppel is a requirement of due process, but whether it is a part of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against double jeopardy.  And if collateral estoppel is embodied in that guarantee, then its applicability in a particular case is no longer a matter to be left for state court determination within the broad *443 bounds of "fundamental fairness," but a matter of constitutional fact we must decide through an examination of the entire record.  Cf. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 285 ; Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U. S. 268, 271 ; Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 51 ; Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227, 229 ; Norris v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 587, 590 .  "Collateral estoppel" is an awkward phrase, but it stands for an extremely important principle in our adversary system of justice.  It means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.  Although first developed in civil litigation, collateral estoppel has been an established rule of federal criminal law at least since this Court's decision more than 50 years ago in United States v. Oppenheimer, 242 U. S. 85 .
**Combined Opinion**
 Any test more technically restrictive would, of course, simply amount to a rejection of the rule of collateral estoppel in criminal proceedings, at least in every case where the first judgment was based upon a general verdict of acquittal.  [9] *445 Straightforward application of the federal rule to the present case can lead to but one conclusion.  For the record is utterly devoid of any indication that the first jury could rationally have found that an armed robbery had not occurred, or that Knight had not been a victim of that robbery.  The single rationally conceivable issue in dispute before the jury was whether the petitioner had been one of the robbers.  And the jury by its verdict found that he had not.  The federal rule of law, therefore, would make a second prosecution for the robbery of Roberts wholly impressible.  The ultimate question to be determined, then, in the light of <citedDecision>Benton</citedDecision> v. Maryland, supra , is whether this established rule of federal law is embodied in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy.  We do not hesitate to hold that it is.  [10] For whatever else that *446 constitutional guarantee may embrace, North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 , it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to "run the gantlet" a second time.  Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 190 .  The question is not whether Missouri could validly charge the petitioner with six separate offenses for the robbery of the six poker players.  It is not whether he could have received a total of six punishments if he had been convicted in a single trial of robbing the six victims.  It is simply whether, after a jury determined by its verdict that the petitioner was not one of the robbers, the State could constitutionally hale him before a new jury to litigate that issue again.
**Combined Opinion**
 On several occasions I have stated my view that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a State or the Federal Government or the two together from subjecting a defendant to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for the same alleged offense.  Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, 150 (1959) (dissenting opinion); Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 201 (1959) (dissenting opinion); Ciucci v. Illinois , 356 U. S. *448 571, 575 (1958) (dissenting statement); Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957).  The opinion of the Court in the case today amply demonstrates that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is a basic and essential part of the Constitution's prohibition against double jeopardy.  Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the Court's opinion I fully agree that petitioner's conviction must be reversed.  MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.  If I were to judge this case under the traditional standards of Fourteenth Amendment due process, I would adhere to the decision in Hoag v. New Jersey, 356 U. S. 464 (1958), believing that regardless of the reach of the federal rule of collateral estoppel, it would have been open to a state court to treat the issue differently.  However, having acceded in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 744 (1969), to the decision in Benton v. Maryland, <citedDecision>395 U. S. 784</citedDecision> (1969), which, over my dissent, held that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes on the States the standards of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, I am satisfied that on this present record Ashe's acquittal in the first trial brought double jeopardy standards into play.  Hence, I join the Court's opinion.  In doing so I wish to make explicit my understanding that the Court's opinion in no way intimates that the Double Jeopardy Clause embraces to any degree the "same transaction" concept reflected in the concurring opinion of my Brother BRENNAN.  MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring.  I agree that the Double Jeopardy Clause incorporates collateral estoppel as a constitutional requirement and therefore join the Court's opinion.  However, even if *449 the rule of collateral estoppel had been inapplicable to the facts of this case, it is my view that the Double Jeopardy Clause nevertheless bars the prosecution of petitioner a second time for armed robbery.  The two prosecutions, the first for the robbery of Knight and the second for the robbery of Roberts, grew out of one criminal episode, and therefore I think it clear on the facts of this case that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited Missouri from prosecuting petitioner for each robbery at a different trial. Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 196-201 (1959) (separate opinion).
**Combined Opinion**
 The New Jersey courts, in rejecting Hoag's double-jeopardy claim, construed the applicable New Jersey statute as making each of the four robberies, although taking place on the same occasion, a separate offense.  This construction was consistent with the state courts' view that a claim of double jeopardy cannot be upheld unless the same evidence necessary to sustain a second indictment would have been sufficient to secure a conviction on the first.  The issues differed only in the identifications of the victims and the property taken from each; otherwise the State's evidence covered the same ground at both trials.  This Court stated that it was unable to hold that the Due Process *450 Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment "always prevents a State from allowing different offenses arising out of the same act or transaction to be prosecuted separately, as New Jersey has done.  For it has long been recognized as the very essence of our federalism that the States should have the widest latitude in the administration of their own systems of criminal justice." 356 U. S., at 468 .  But in the present case Missouri did not have "the widest latitude" because Benton v. Maryland, <citedDecision>395 U. S. 784</citedDecision> (1969), decided after Hoag , held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee that no person shall "be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb" is enforceable against the States, and North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), accorded fully retroactive effect to that holding.  This means, under our decisions, that federal standards as to what constitutes the "same offence" apply alike to federal and state proceedings; it would be incongruous to have different standards determine the validity of a claim of double jeopardy depending on whether the claim was asserted in a state or federal court. Cf. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 11 (1964).  The Double Jeopardy Clause is a guarantee "that the State with all its resources and power [shall] not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.  .  .  ." Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187 (1957).

 Or alter the crime to four men breaking into a college dormitory and assaulting six girls.  What the Court is holding is, in effect, that the second and third and fourth criminal acts are "free," unless the accused is tried for the multiple crimes in a single trialsomething defendants frantically use every legal device to avoid, and often succeed in avoiding.  This is the reality of what the Court holds today; it does not make good sense and it cannot make good law. *470 I therefore join with the four courts that have found no double jeopardy in this case. To borrow some wise words from MR. JUSTICE BLACK in his separate opinion in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368, 401, 407-408 (1964), the conviction struck down in this case "is in full accord with all the guarantees of the Federal Constitution and .  .  .  should not be held invalid by this Court because of a belief that the Court can improve on the Constitution." NOTES [1]  There can be no doubt of the "retroactivity" of the Court's decision in <citedDecision>Benton</citedDecision> v. Maryland .  In North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 , decided the same day as <citedDecision>Benton</citedDecision> , the Court unanimously accorded fully "retroactive" effect to the <citedDecision>Benton</citedDecision> doctrine.  [2]  "The Court instructs the jury that if you believe and find from the evidence in this case, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at the County of Jackson and State of Missouri, on the 10th day of January, 1960, the defendant herein, BOB FRED ASHE, alias BOBBY FRED ASHE, either alone or knowingly acting in concert with others, did then and there with force and arms in and upon one Don Knight, unlawfully and feloniously make an assault and took and carried away any money from his person or in his presence and against his will, by force and violence to his person, or by putting him in fear of some immediate injury to his person, with felonious intent to convert the same to his own use, without any honest claim to said money on the part of the defendant and with intent to permanently deprive the said Don Knight of his ownership and without the consent of the said Don Knight, if such be your finding, then you will find the defendant guilty of Robbery, First Degree, and so find in your verdict." [3]  "The Court instructs the jury that all persons are equally guilty who act together with a common intent in the commission of a crime, and a crime so committed by two or more persons jointly is the act of all and of each one so acting.  "The Court instructs the jury that when two or more persons knowingly act together in the commission of an unlawful act or purpose, then whatever either does in furtherance of such unlawful act or purpose is in law the act and deed of each of such persons." [4]  "However persuasive the dissenting opinions in the Hoag case may be, it is the duty of this Court to follow the law as stated by the Supreme Court of the United States until it expresses a contrary view.  Certainly the factual circumstances of this case provide an excellent opportunity for reexamination of the questions presented.  An examination of the transcript of both trials shows that in both the single issue in real contest, as distinguished from the issues that may be said to have been in technical dispute, was the question of whether petitioner was or was not present at the time the money was taken from the poker table and the other property taken from persons of the respective poker players."

 A single course of criminal conduct was likely to yield but a single offense.  See Comment, Statutory Implementation of Double Jeopardy Clauses: New Life for a Moribund Constitutional Guarantee, 65 Yale L. J. 339, 342.  In more recent times, with the advent of specificity in draftsmanship and the extraordinary proliferation of overlapping and related statutory offenses, it became possible for prosecutors to spin out a startlingly numerous series of offenses from a single alleged criminal transaction.  See Note, Double Jeopardy and the Multiple-Count Indictment, 57 Yale L. J. 132, 133.  As the number of statutory offenses multiplied, the potential for unfair and abusive reprosecutions became far more pronounced.  Comment, Twice in Jeopardy, 75 Yale L. J. 262, 279-280; Note, Double Jeopardy and the Concept of Identity of Offenses, 7 Brooklyn L. Rev. 79, 82.  The federal courts soon recognized the need to prevent such abuses through the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and it became a safeguard firmly embedded in federal law. See n. 7, supra. Whether its basis was a constitutional one was a question of no more than academic concern until this Court's decision in <citedDecision>Benton</citedDecision> v. Maryland, supra .  [1]  See, e. g., Vaux's Case, 4 Co. Rep. 44 a, 45 a, 76 Eng. Rep. 992, 993 (K. B. 1591); 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown **240-255 ("same felony"); 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 515 (8th ed. 1824); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *335.  [2]  See generally J. Sigler, Double Jeopardy 1-37 (1969).  [3]  See Baker, The ProsecutorInitiation of Prosecution, 23 J. Crim. L. & C. 770 (1933); Baker & De Long, The Prosecuting Attorney Powers and Duties in Criminal Prosecution, 24 J. Crim. L. & C. 1025 (1934); Kaplan, The Prosecutorial DiscretionA Comment, 60 Nw. U. L. Rev. 174 (1965); Note, Prosecutor's Discretion, 103 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1057 (1955); Note, Discretion Exercised by Montana County Attorneys in Criminal Prosecutions, 28 Mont. L. Rev. 41 (1966); Note, Prosecutorial Discretion in the Initiation of Criminal Complaints, 42 So. Cal. L. Rev. 519 (1969).  [4]  Several subsidiary rules have been developed in attempts to eliminate anomalies resulting from the "same evidence" test.  Thus, where one offense is included in another, prosecution for one bars reprosecution for the other even though the evidence necessary to prove the two offenses is different.  Similarly, doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel have provided some, though not very much, relief from the extreme permissiveness of the test.
