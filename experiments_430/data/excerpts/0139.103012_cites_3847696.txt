 The common law so far as it is enforced in a State, whether called common law or not, is not the common law generally but the law of that State existing by the authority of that State without regard to what it may .have been in England or anywhere else. .  .  .  “the authority and only authority is the State, and if that be so, the voice adopted by the State as its own [whether it be of its Legislature or of its Supremé Court] should utter the last word.” Thus the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson is, as Mr. Justice Holmes said, “an unconstitutional assumption of powers by courts of the United States which no lapse of time or respectable array of opinion should make us hesitate to correct.” In disapproving that doctrine we do not hold *80 unconstitutional § 34 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789 or any other Act of Congress.  We merely declare that in applying the doctrine this Court and the lower courts have invaded rights whicíi in our opinion are reserved by the Constitution to the several States.  Fourth.  The defendant contended that by the common law of Pennsylvania as declared by its highest court in Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. Co., <citedDecision>307 Pa. 203</citedDecision> ; <citedDecision>160 A. 859</citedDecision> , the only duty owed to the plaintiff was to refrain from wilful or wanton injury.  The plaintiff denied that such is the Pennsylvania law. 24 In support of their respective contentions the parties discussed and cited many decisions of the Supreme Court of the State.  The Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the question of liability is one of general law; and on thjat ground declined to decide the issue of state law. As.  we hold this was error, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded to it for further proceedings in conformity with our opini o n. Reversed.  Mr. Justice Cardozo took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. Mr. Justice Butler.  The case presented by the evidence is a simple one.  Plaintiff was severely injured in Pennsylvania.

 diversity of citizenship, plaintiff, a citizen .and resident of Pennsylvania, brought this suit to recover damages against, defendant, a New York corporation, in the federal court for the southern district of that State.  The issues were whether negligence of defendant was a proximate cause of his injuries and whether negligence of plaintiff contributed.  He claimed that, by hauling the car with the open door, defendant violated a duty to him.  The defendant insisted that it violated no duty and that plaintiff’s injuries were caused by his own negligence.  ..The jury gave him a verdict on which the trial court entered judgment; the circuit court of appeals affirmed.  90 F. (2d) 603.  Defendant maintained, citing Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. Co., <citedDecision>307 Pa. 203</citedDecision> ; <citedDecision>160 A. 859</citedDecision> , and Koontz v. B. & O. R. Co., 309 Pa. 122 ; 163 A. 212 , that the only duty owed plaintiff was to refrain from willfully or wantonly injuring him; it argued that the courts of Pennsylvania had so ruled with respect to persons using a customary longitudinal path, as distinguished from one crossing the track.  The plaintiff, insisted that the Pennsylvania decisions did not establish the rule for which the defendant contended.. Upon that issue the circuit court of appeals said (p. 604): “We need hot go into this' matter since the defendant concedes that the great weight of authority in other states is' to the contrary.- This concession is fatal to its contention, for upon questions of general law the federal courts are.  free, in absence of a local statute, to exercise their independent judgment as to what the law is; and it is well settled that the question of the responsibility of a railroad for injuries caused by its servants is one of general law.” *82 Upon that basis the court held the evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that plaintiff’s injuries were caused by the negligence of defendant.  It also held the question of contributory negligence one for the jury.  Defendant’s petition for writ of certiorari presented two questions: Whether its duty toward plaintiff should have been determined in accordance with the law as found by the highest court of Pennsylvania, and whether the evidence conclusively showed plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence.  Plaintiff contends that, as always heretofore held by this Court, the issues of negligence and contributory negligence are to be determined by general law against which local decisions may not be held conclusive; that defendant relies.on a solitary Pennsylvania case of doubtful applicability and that, even jtf the decisions of'the courts of that State were deemed controlling, the same result would have to be reached.  No constitutional question was suggested or argued below or here.

Mr. Justice Field filed a dissenting opinion,-several sentences of which are quoted in the decision just announced.  The dissent failed to impress any of his associates.  It assumes that adherence to § 34 as construed involves a supervision over legislative or judicial action of the states.  There is no foundation for that suggestion.  Clearly the dissent of the learned Justice rests upon misapprehension of the rule.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Reed. I concur in the conclusion reached in this case, in the disapproval of the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson, and in the reasoning of the majority opinion except in so far as it relies upon the unconstitutionality of the “course pursued” by the federal courts. The “doctrine of Swift v. Tyson,” as I understand it, is that the words “the laws,” as used in § 34, line one, of the Federal Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, do not include in their meaning “the decisions of the local tribunals.” Mr. Justice Story, in deciding that point, said ( 16 Pet. 19 ): *91 “Undoubtedly, the decisions of the local tribunals upon such subjects are entitled to, and will receive, the most deliberate attention and respect of this Court; but they cannot furnish positive rules, or conclusive authority, by which our own judgments are to be bound up and governed.” To decide the case now before us and to “disapprove” the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson requires only that we say that the words “the laws” include in their meaning the decisions of the local tribunals. As the majority opinion shows, by its reference to Mr. Warren’s researches and the first quotation from Mr. Justice Holmes, that this Court is now of the view that “laws” includes “decisions,” it is unnecessary to go further and declare that the “course pursued” was “unconstitutional,” instead of merely erroneous. The “unconstitutional” course referred to in the majority opinion is apparently the ruling in Swift v. Tyson that the supposed omission of Congress to legislate as to the effect of decisions leaves federal courts free to interpret general law for themselves. I am not at all sure whether, in the absence of federal statutory direction, federal courts would be compelled to follow state decisions. There was sufficient doubt about the matter in 1789 to induce the first Congress to legislate. No former opinions of this Court have passed upon it. Mr. Justice Holmes evidently saw nothing “unconstitutional” which required the overruling of Swift v. Tyson, for he said in the very opinion quoted by the majority, “I should leave Swift v. Tyson undisturbed, as I indicated in Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., but I would not allow it to spread the assumed dominion into new fields.” Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., 276 U. S. 518, 535 . If the opinion commits this Court to the position that the Congress is without power to declare what rules of substantive law shall govern the federal courts, *92 that conclusion also seems questionable. The line between procedural and substantive law is hazy but no one doubts federal power over procedure. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1 . The Judiciary Article and the “necessary and proper” clause of Article One may fully authorize legislation, such as this section of the Judiciary Act. In this Court, stare decisis, in statutory construction, is a useful rule, hot an inexorable command. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 , dissent, p. 406, note 1. Compare Read v. Bishop of Lincoln, [1892] A. C. 644, 655; London Street Tramways Co. v. London County Council, [1898] A. C. 375, 379. It seems preferable to overturn an established construction- of an Act of Congress, rather than, in the circumstances of this case, to interpret the Constitution. Cf. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366 . . There is no occasion to discuss further the range or soundness of these few; phrases of the opinion. It is sufficient now to call attention, to them and express my own non-acquiescence.
