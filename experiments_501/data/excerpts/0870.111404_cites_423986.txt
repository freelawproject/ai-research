**Combined Opinion**
Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the Court. The issue presented is whether the Fifth Amendment’s grand jury guarantee 1 is violated when a defendant is tried under an indictment that alleges a certain fraudulent scheme but is convicted based on trial proof that supports only a significantly narrower and more limited, though included, fraudulent scheme.  A grand jury in the Northern District of California returned an indictment charging respondent Miller with three counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 1341 .  After the Government moved to dismiss the third count, Miller was tried before a jury and convicted of the remaining two.  He appealed asserting that there had been a fatal variance between the “scheme and artifice” to defraud charged in the indictment and that which the Government proved at trial. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and vacated the judgment of conviction.  <citedDecision>715 F. 2d 1360</citedDecision> (1983), modified, 728 F. 2d 1269 (1984).  We granted certiorari, 469 U. S. 814 (1984), and reverse.  I A The indictment had charged Miller with various fraudulent acts in connection with a burglary at his place of business.  *132 Miller allegedly had defrauded his insurer both by consenting to the burglary in advance and by lying to the insurer about the value of his loss.  2 The trial proof, however, concerned only the latter allegation, focusing on whether, prior to the burglary, Miller actually had possessed all the property that he later claimed was taken.  This proof was clearly sufficient *133 to support a jury finding that Miller’s claim to his insurer had grossly inflated the value of any actual loss.  3 The Government moved to strike the part of the indictment that alleged prior knowledge of the burglary, and it correctly argued that even without that allegation the indictment still made out a violation of §1341.  4 Respondent’s counsel opposed the change, and at his urging the entire indictment was sent to the jury.  The jury found Miller *134 guilty, and respondent appealed on the basis that the trial proof had fatally varied from the scheme alleged in the indictment.  Agreeing that Miller’s Fifth Amendment right to be tried only on a grand jury indictment had been violated, the Court of Appeals vacated the conviction.  It succinctly stated its rationale: “The grand jury may well have declined to indict Miller simply on the basis of his exaggeration of the amount of his claimed loss.  ... In fact it is quite possible that the grand jury would have been unwilling or unable to return an indictment based solely on Miller’s exaggeration of the amount of his claimed loss even though it had concluded that an indictment could be returned based on the overall scheme involving a use of the mail caused by Miller’s knowing consent to the burglary.” <citedDecision>715 F. 2d, at 1362-1363</citedDecision> .  B Miller’s indictment properly alleged violations of 18 U. S. C. § 1341 , and it fully and clearly set forth a number of ways in which the acts alleged constituted violations.  The facts proved at trial clearly conformed to one of the theories of the offense contained within that indictment, for the indictment gave Miller clear notice that he would have to defend against an allegation that he “‘well knew that the amount of copper claimed to have been taken during the alleged burglary was grossly inflated for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining $150,000 from Aetna Insurance Company.’” <citedDecision>715 F. 2d, at 1361</citedDecision> -1362 (quoting indictment).  Competent defense counsel certainly should have been on notice that that offense was charged and would need to be defended against.  Accordingly, there can be no showing here that Miller was prejudicially surprised at trial by the absence of proof concerning his alleged complicity in the burglary; *135 nor can there be a showing that the variance prejudiced the fairness of respondent’s trial in any other way.  Cf. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946).  See also Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78, 83 (1935).  Cf. also United States v. Ballard, 322 U. S. 78, 91 (1944) (Stone, C. J., dissenting).  The indictment was also sufficient to allow Miller to plead it in the future as a bar to subsequent prosecutions.  Therefore, none of these “notice” related concerns— which of course are among the important concerns underlying the requirement that criminal charges be set out in an indictment — would support the result of the Court of Appeals.  See Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749, 763-764 (1962).  The Court of Appeals did not disagree, but instead argued that Miller had been prejudiced in his right to be free from a trial for any offense other than that alleged in the grand jury’s indictment.  728 F. 2d, at 1270 .  It reasoned that a grand jury’s willingness to indict an individual for participation in a broad criminal plan does not establish that the same grand jury would have indicted the individual for participating in a substantially narrower, even if wholly included, criminal plan.  <citedDecision>715 F. 2d, at 1362-1363</citedDecision> .  Relying on the Fifth Amendment’s grand jury guarantee, the Court of Appeals concluded that a conviction could not stand where the trial proof corresponded to a fraudulent scheme much narrower than, though included within, the scheme that the grand jury had alleged.  The Court of Appeals cited two prior decisions of this Court that emphasized the right of an accused to be tried only on charges that had in fact been passed on by a grand jury; Ibid, (citing Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212 (1960), and Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1 (1887)).  Cf. United States v. Mastelotto, 717 F. 2d 1238, 1248-1250 (CA91983) (similarly relying on Stirone and Bain).  II The Government correctly argues that the Court of Appeals’ result conflicts with a number of this Court’s prior *136 decisions interpreting the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause.. The Court has long recognized that an indictment may charge numerous offenses or the commission of any one offense in several ways.  As long as the crime and the elements of the offense that sustain the conviction are fully and clearly set out in the indictment, the right to a grand jury is not normally violated by the fact that the indictment alleges more crimes or other means of committing the same crime.  See, e. g., Ford v. United States, 273 U. S. 593 (1927); Salinger v. United States, 272 U. S. 542 (1926).
**Combined Opinion**
 It was a further part of the scheme that on or about July 15, 1981, defendant would and did report that a burglary had occurred at San Francisco Scrap Metal during the evening of July 14, 1981.  “ ‘5.  It was a further part of the scheme that defendant would and did claim to have lost 210,170 pounds of copper wire, worth $123,500 and two trucks during the alleged burglary.  “ ‘6.  It was a further part of the scheme that defendant well knew that the alleged burglary was committed with his knowledge and consent for the purpose of obtaining the insurance proceeds.  “ ‘7.  It was a further part of the scheme that defendant well knew that the amount of copper claimed to have been taken during the alleged burglary was grossly inflated for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining $150,000 from Aetna Insurance company.’” <citedDecision>715 F. 2d 1360, 1361-1362</citedDecision> (1983).  Each count in the indictment was based on this same scheme to defraud, and these paragraphs were included by reference in the other two counts.  The separate counts reflected only separate uses of the mails.  3 The facts, as stipulated to by the parties, included the following: The respondent, James Rual Miller, was the owner of San Francisco Scrap Metals, Inc., a company that regularly purchased scrap wire, and stripped, baled, and resold it.  On the morning of July 15, 1981, Miller reported that his business had been burglarized the previous evening and that two trucks and 201,000 pounds of copper wire had been stolen.  On July 20, 1981, Miller reported to the insurance adjuster that the missing copper had been purchased from L. K. Comstock, Inc., and Kingston Electric.  Kingston Electric had indeed sold a quantity of copper to San Francisco Scrap Metals, but San Francisco Scrap Metals had resold a similar quantity to Battery Salvage Company.  Miller claimed that the copper sold to Battery Salvage had been purchased from another company.  But in fact, neither that other company nor L. K. Comstock had sold San Francisco Scrap Metals the copper claimed to have been purchased.  Miller sent his proof of loss through the United States mail and received $100,000.  Aetna sent one $50,000 check to Miller through the mail.  <citedDecision>

C. § 1341 reads as follows: “Whoever, having devised or intended to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or to sell, dispose of, loan, exchange, alter, give away, distribute, supply, or furnish or procure for unlawful use any counterfeit or spurious coin, obligation, security, or other article, or anything represented to be or intimated or held out to be such counterfeit or spurious article, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or takes or receives therefrom any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon, or at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.” 5 As is discussed supra, at 134-135, Miller has shown no prejudice to his ability to defend himself at trial, to the general fairness of the trial, or to the indictment’s sufficiency to bar subsequent prosecutions, and the Court of Appeals did not rest on any such theories of prejudice.  Cf. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750 (1946) (finding prejudice in a case of extreme variance between a charge of a very broad conspiracy and proof of far narrower but technically included conspiracies).  See also Berger v. United States, 295 U. S., at 83 .  6 This analysis is apparent in Sam’s discussion of the issue: “The learned judge who presided ... at the time the change was made in this indictment.  .  .
