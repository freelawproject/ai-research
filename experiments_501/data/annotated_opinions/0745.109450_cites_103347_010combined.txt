 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra ; NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 429 (1963); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S., at 417 ; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 306-307 (1940).  If there is a kind of commercial speech that lacks all First Amendment protection, therefore, it must be distinguished by its content.  Yet the speech whose content deprives it of protection cannot simply be speech on a commercial subject.  No one would contend that our pharmacist may be prevented from being heard on *762 the subject of whether, in general, pharmaceutical prices should be regulated, or their advertisement forbidden.  Nor can it be dispositive that a commercial advertisement is noneditorial, and merely reports a fact.  Purely factual matter of public interest may claim protection.  Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S., at 822 ; Thornhill v. Alabama, <citedDecision>310 U. S. 88, 102</citedDecision> (1940).  Our question is whether speech which does "no more than propose a commercial transaction," Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S., at 385 , is so removed from any "exposition of ideas," Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572 (1942), and from " `truth, science, morality, and arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on the administration of Government,' " Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957), that it lacks all protection.  Our answer is that it is not.  Focusing first on the individual parties to the transaction that is proposed in the commercial advertisement, we may assume that the advertiser's interest is a purely economic one.  That hardly disqualifies him from protection under the First Amendment.  The interests of the Contestants in a labor dispute are primarily economic, but it has long been settled that both the employee and the employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome.  See e. g., NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575, 617-618 (1969); NLRB v. Virginia Electric & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477 (1941); AFL v. Swing, 312 U. S. 321, 325-326 (1941); <citedDecision>Thornhill</citedDecision> v. Alabama, <citedDecision>310 U. S., at 102</citedDecision> .  We know of no requirement that, in order to avail themselves of First Amendment protection, the parties to a labor dispute need address themselves to the merits of unionism in general *763 or to any subject beyond their immediate dispute.  [17] It was observed in <citedDecision>Thornhill</citedDecision> that "the practices in a single factory may have economic repercussions upon a whole region and affect widespread systems of marketing." <citedDecision>Id., at 103</citedDecision> .  Since the fate of such a "single factory" could as well turn on its ability to advertise its product as on the resolution of its labor difficulties, we see no satisfactory distinction between the two kinds of speech.  As to the particular consumer's interest in the free flow of commercial information, that interest may be as keen, if not keener by far, than his interest in the day's most urgent political debate.  Appellees' case in this respect is a convincing one.  Those whom the suppression of prescription drug price information hits the hardest are the poor, the sick, and particularly the aged.  A disproportionate amount of their income tends to be spent on prescription drugs; yet they are the least able to learn, by shopping from pharmacist to pharmacist, where their scarce dollars are best spent.  [18] When drug prices *764 vary as strikingly as they do, information as to who is charging what becomes more than a convenience.

 I think it important to note also that the advertisement of professional services carries with it quite different risks from the advertisement of standard products.  The Court took note of this in Semler, supra, at 612 , in upholding a state statute prohibiting entirely certain types of advertisement by dentists: "The legislature was not dealing with traders in *775 commodities, but with the vital interest of public health, and with a profession treating bodily ills and demanding different standards of conduct from those which are traditional in the competition of the market place.  The community is concerned with the maintenance of professional standards which will insure not only competency in individual practitioners, but protection against those who would prey upon a public peculiarly susceptible to imposition through alluring promises of physical relief.  And the community is concerned in providing safeguards not only against deception, but against practices which would tend to demoralize the profession by forcing its members into an unseemly rivalry which would enlarge the opportunities of the least scrupulous." I doubt that we know enough about evaluating the quality of medical and legal services to know which claims of superiority are "misleading" and which are justifiable.  Nor am I sure that even advertising the price of certain professional services is not inherently misleading, since what the professional must do will vary greatly in individual cases. It is important to note that the Court wisely leaves these issues to another day. MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.  In Thornhill v. Alabama, <citedDecision>310 U. S. 88</citedDecision> , the Court observed that "[f]reedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period." <citedDecision>Id., at 102</citedDecision> .  Shortly after the <citedDecision>Thornhill</citedDecision> decision, the Court identified a single category of communications that is constitutionally unprotected: communications "which by their very utterance inflict *776 injury." Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572 .  Yet only a month after Chaplinsky , and without reference to that decision, the Court stated in Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52 , 54 that "the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising." For more than 30 years this "casual, almost offhand" statement in Chrestensen has operated to exclude commercial speech from the protection afforded by the First Amendment to other types of communication.  Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S. 498, 514 (Douglas, J., concurring).  [1] Today the Court ends the anomalous situation created by Chrestensen and holds that a communication which does no more than propose a commercial transaction is not "wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment." Ante, at 761.
