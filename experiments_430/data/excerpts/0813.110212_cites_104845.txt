 has a right to every man’s evidence.’ ” United States v. Bryan, 339 U. S. 323, 331 (1950).  As such, they must be strictly construed and accepted “only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.” Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 234 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  Accord, United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, *51 709-710 (1974).  Here we must decide whether the privilege against adverse spousal testimony promotes sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for probative evidence in the administration of criminal justice.  It is essential to remember that the Hawkins privilege is not needed to protect information privately disclosed between husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship— once described by this Court as “the best solace of human existence.” Stein v. Bowman, 13 Pet., at 223 .  Those confidences are privileged under the independent rule protecting confidential marital communications.  Blau v. United States, <citedDecision>340 U. S. 332</citedDecision> (1951); see n. 5, supra. The Hawkins privilege is invoked, not to exclude private marital communications, but rather to exclude evidence of criminal acts and of communications made in the presence of third persons.  No other testimonial privilege sweeps so broadly.  The privileges between priest and penitent, attorney and client, and physician and patient limit protection to private communications.  These privileges are rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust.  The priest-penitent privilege recognizes the human need to disclose to a spiritual counselor, in total and absolute confidence, what are believed to be flawed acts or thoughts and to receive priestly consolation and guidance in return.  The lawyer-client privilege rests on the need for the advocate and counselor to know all that relates to the client’s reasons for seeking representation if the professional mission is to be carried out.  Similarly, the physician must know all that a patient can articulate in order to identify and to treat disease; barriers to full disclosure would impair diagnosis and treatment.

 In response to the question whether divorce was contemplated, Mrs. Trammel testified that her husband had said that “I would go my way and he would go his.” App. 27.  The Government represents to the Court that Elizabeth Trammel has not been prosecuted for her role in the conspiracy.  Roberts and Freeman were also convicted.  Roberts was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.  Freeman received an indeterminate sentence under the Youth Corrections Act.  See Brosman, Edward Livingston and Spousal Testimony in Louisiana, 11 Tulane L. Rev. 243 (1937); Hutchins & Slesinger, Some Observations *45 on the Law of Evidence: Family Relations, 13 Minn. L.

This Court recognized just such a confidential marital communications privilege in Wolfle v. United States, 291 U. S. 7 (1934), and in Blau v. United States, <citedDecision>340 U. S. 332</citedDecision> (1951).  In neither case, however, did the Court adopt the Wigmore view that the communications privilege be substituted in place of the privilege against adverse spousal testimony.  The privilege as to confidential marital communications is not at issue in the instant case; accordingly, our holding today does not disturb Wolfie and <citedDecision>Blau</citedDecision> .  See Note, Competency of One Spouse to Testify Against the Other in *46 Criminal Cases Where the Testimony Does Not Relate to Confidential Communications: Modern Trend, 38 Va. L. Rev. 359 (1952).  The decision in Wyatt recognized an exception to Hawkins for cases in which one spouse commits a crime against the other.  362 U. S., at 526 .  This exception, placed on the ground of necessity, was a longstanding one at common law. See Lord Audley’s Case, 123 Eng. Rep. 1140 (1631); 8 Wigmore §2239.  It has been expanded since then to include crimes against the spouse’s property, see Herman v. United States, 220 F. 2d 219, 226 (CA4 1955), and in recent years crimes against children of either spouse, United States v. Allery, 526 F. 2d 1362 (CA8 1975).  Similar exceptions have been found to the confidential marital communications privilege.

Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring in the judgment. Although agreeing with much of what the Court has to say, I cannot join an opinion that implies that “reason and experience” have worked a vast change since the Hawkins case was decided in 1958. In that case the Court upheld the privilege of a defendant in a criminal case to prevent adverse spousal testimony, in an all-but-unanimous opinion by Mr. Justice Black. Today the Court, in another all-but-unanimous opinion, obliterates that privilege because of the pur- *54 ported change in perception that “reason and experience” have'wrought. The fact of the matter is that the Court in this case simply accepts the very same arguments that the Court rejected when the Government first made them in the Hawkins case in 1958. I thought those arguments were valid then, 1 and I think so now. The Court is correct when it says that “[t]he ancient foundations for so sweeping a privilege have long since disappeared.” Ante, at 52. But those foundations had disappeared well before 1958; their disappearance certainly did not occur in the few years that have elapsed between the Hawkins decision and this one. To paraphrase what Mr. Justice Jackson once said in another context, there is reason to believe that today’s opinion of the Court will be of greater interest to students of human psychology than to students of law. 2 “The rule of evidence we are here asked to re-examine has been called a ‘sentimental relic.’ It was bom of two concepts long since rejected: that a criminal defendant was incompetent to testify in his own case, and that in law husband and wife were one. What thus began as a disqualification of either spouse from testifying at all yielded gradually to the policy of admitting all relevant evidence, until it has now become simply a privilege of the criminal defendant to prevent his spouse from testifying against him. “Any rule that impedes the discovery of truth in a court of law impedes as well the doing of justice. When such a rule is the product of a con-ceptualism long ago discarded, is universally criticized by scholars, and has been qualified or abandoned in many jurisdictions, it should receive the most careful scrutiny. Surely ‘reason and experience’ require that we do more than indulge in mere assumptions, perhaps naive assumptions, as to the importance of this ancient rule to the interests of domestic tranquillity.” Hawkins v. United States, 358 U. S. 74, 81-82 (concurring opinion) (citations and footnotes omitted). See Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 325 (dissenting opinion).
