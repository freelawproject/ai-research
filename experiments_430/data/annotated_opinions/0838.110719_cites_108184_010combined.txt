 No warrant was obtained.  Ross was charged with possession of heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U. S. C. § 841 (a).  Prior to trial, he moved to suppress the heroin found in the paper bag and the currency found in the leather pouch.  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied the motion to suppress.  The heroin and currency were introduced in evidence at trial and Ross was convicted.  A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.  It held that the police had probable cause to stop and search Ross' car and that, under Carroll v. United States, supra , and Chambers v. Maroney, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 42</citedDecision> , the officers lawfully could search the automobile  including its trunk  without a warrant.  The court considered separately, however, the warrantless search of the two containers found in the trunk.  On the basis of Arkansas v. Sanders, *802 442 U. S. 753 , the court concluded that the constitutionality of a warrantless search of a container found in an automobile depends on whether the owner possesses a reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents.  Applying that test, the court held that the warrantless search of the paper bag was valid but the search of the leather pouch was not.  The court remanded for a new trial at which the items taken from the paper bag, but not those from the leather pouch, could be admitted.  [2] The entire Court of Appeals then voted to rehear the case en banc.  A majority of the court rejected the panel's conclusion that a distinction of constitutional significance existed between the two containers found in respondent's trunk; it held that the police should not have opened either container without first obtaining a warrant.

 IV In Carroll itself, the whiskey that the prohibition agents seized was not in plain view.  It was discovered only after an officer opened the rumble seat and tore open the upholstery of the lazyback.  The Court did not find the scope of the search unreasonable.  Having stopped Carroll and Kiro on a public road and subjected them to the indignity of a vehicle *818 search  which the Court found to be a reasonable intrusion on their privacy because it was based on probable cause that their vehicle was transporting contraband  prohibition agents were entitled to tear open a portion of the roadster itself.  The scope of the search was no greater than a magistrate could have authorized by issuing a warrant based on the probable cause that justified the search.  Since such a warrant could have authorized the agents to open the rear portion of the roadster and to rip the upholstery in their search for concealed whiskey, the search was constitutionally permissible.  In <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maroney</citedDecision> the police found weapons and stolen property "concealed in a compartment under the dashboard." <citedDecision>399 U. S., at 44</citedDecision> .  No suggestion was made that the scope of the search was impermissible.  It would be illogical to assume that the outcome of <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision>  or the outcome of Carroll itself  would have been different if the police had found the secreted contraband enclosed within a secondary container and had opened that container without a warrant.  If it was reasonable for prohibition agents to rip open the upholstery in Carroll , it certainly would have been reasonable for them to look into a burlap sack stashed inside; if it was reasonable to open the concealed compartment in <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> , it would have been equally reasonable to open a paper bag crumpled within it.  A contrary rule could produce absurd results inconsistent with the decision in Carroll itself.  In its application of Carroll , this Court in fact has sustained warrantless searches of containers found during a lawful search of an automobile.  In Husty v. United States, 282 U. S. 694 , the Court upheld a warrantless seizure of whiskey found during a search of an automobile, some of which was discovered in "whiskey bags" that could have contained other goods.  [23] In Scher v. United States, 305 U. S. 251 , federal officers *819 seized and searched packages of unstamped liquor found in the trunk of an automobile searched without a warrant.  As described by a police officer who participated in the search: "I turned the handle and opened the trunk and found the trunk completely filled with packages wrapped in brown paper, and tied with twine; I think somewhere around thirty packages, each one containing six bottles." [24] In these cases it was not contended that police officers needed a warrant to open the whiskey bags or to unwrap the brown paper packages.

 Rather, I repeated the view I long have held that one's "reasonable expectation of privacy" is a particularly relevant factor in determining the validity of a warrantless search.  I have recognized that, with respect to automobiles in general, this expectation can be only a limited one.  See Arkansas v. Sanders, supra, at 761 ; Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U. S. 266, 279 (1973) (POWELL, J., concurring).  I continue to think that in many situations one's reasonable expectation of privacy may be a decisive factor in a search case. It became evident last Term, however, from the five opinions written in Robbins  in none of which THE CHIEF JUSTICE joined  that it is essential to have a Court opinion in automobile search cases that provides "specific guidance to police and courts in this recurring situation." Robbins v. California, supra, at 435 (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court's opinion today, written by JUSTICE STEVENS and now joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and four other Justices, will afford this needed guidance.  It is fair also to say that, given Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925), and Chambers v. Maroney, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 42</citedDecision> (1970), the Court's decision does not depart substantially from Fourth Amendment doctrine in automobile cases. Moreover, in enunciating a readily understood and applied rule, today's decision is consistent with the similar step taken last Term in New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981).  I join the Court's opinion.  JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.  I would not overrule Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 (1981).  For the reasons stated by Justice Stewart in that *827 case, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I also agree with much of JUSTICE MARSHALL's dissent in this case. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.  The majority today not only repeals all realistic limits on warrantless automobile searches, it repeals the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement itself.

 See also Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U. S. 307, 323 (1978); United States v. United States District Court, supra, at 321.  The safeguards embodied in the warrant requirement apply as forcefully to automobile searches as to any others.  Our cases do recognize a narrow exception to the warrant requirement for certain automobile searches.  Throughout our decisions, two major considerations have been advanced to justify the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.  *830 We have upheld only those searches that are actually justified by those considerations.  First, these searches have been justified on the basis of the exigency of the mobility of the automobile.  See, e. g., Chambers v. Maroney, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 42</citedDecision> (1970); Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925).  This "mobility" rationale is something of a misnomer, cf. Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U. S. 433, 442-443 (1973), since the police ordinarily can remove the car's occupants and secure the vehicle on the spot. However, the inherent mobility of the vehicle often creates situations in which the police's only alternative to an immediate search may be to release the automobile from their possession.  [2] This alternative creates an unacceptably high risk of losing the contents of the vehicle, and is a principal basis for the Court's automobile exception to the warrant requirement.  See <citedDecision>Chambers, supra, at 51, n. 9</citedDecision> .  In many cases, however, the police will, prior to searching the car, have cause to arrest the occupants and bring them to the station for booking.  In this situation, the police can ordinarily seize the automobile and bring it to the station.  Because the vehicle is now in the exclusive control of the authorities, any subsequent search cannot be justified by the mobility of the car. Rather, an immediate warrantless search of the vehicle is permitted because of the second major justification for the automobile exception: the diminished expectation of privacy in an automobile.  Because an automobile presents much of its contents in open view to police officers who legitimately stop it on a public way, is used for travel, and is subject to significant government *831 regulation, this Court has determined that the intrusion of a warrantless search of an automobile is constitutionally less significant than a warrantless search of more private areas.  See Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753, 761 (1979) (collecting cases).  This justification has been invoked for warrantless automobile searches in circumstances where the exigency of mobility was clearly not present.  See, e. g., South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364, 367-368 (1976); Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, at 441-442 .  By focusing on the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy, this Court has refused to require a warrant in situations where the process of obtaining such a warrant would be more intrusive than the actual search itself.  Cf. Katz v. United States, supra .  A defendant may consider the seizure of the car a greater intrusion than an immediate search.  See <citedDecision>Chambers, supra, at 51-52</citedDecision> .  Therefore, even where police can bring both the defendant and the automobile to the station safely and can house the car while they seek a warrant, the police are permitted to decide whether instead to conduct an immediate search of the car. In effect, the warrantless search is permissible because a warrant requirement would not provide significant protection of the defendant's Fourth Amendment interests.  B The majority's rule is flatly inconsistent with these established Fourth Amendment principles concerning the scope of the automobile exception and the importance of the warrant requirement.  Historically, the automobile exception has been limited to those situations where its application is compelled by the justifications described above.  Today, the majority makes no attempt to base its decision on these justifications.  This failure is not surprising, since the traditional rationales for the automobile exception plainly do not support extending it to the search of a container found inside a vehicle.  *832 The practical mobility problem  deciding what to do with both the car and the occupants if an immediate search is not conducted  is simply not present in the case of movable containers, which can easily be seized and brought to the magistrate.

 Although there is no need to describe the exact contours of that protection in this dissenting opinion, it is clear enough that closed, opaque containers  regardless of whether they are "worthy" or are always used to store personal items  are ordinarily fully protected.  Cf. Sanders, supra, at 764, n. 13 .  [4] Here, because respondent Ross had placed the evidence in question in a closed paper bag, the container could be seized, but not searched, without a warrant.  No practical exigencies required the warrantless searches on the street or at the station: Ross had been arrested and was in custody when both searches occurred, and the police succeeded in transporting the bag to the station without inadvertently spilling its contents.  [5] II In announcing its new rule, the Court purports to rely on earlier automobile search cases, especially Carroll v. United States .  The Court's approach, however, far from being "faithful to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that the Court has followed with substantial consistency throughout our history," ante, at 824, is plainly contrary to the letter and the spirit of our prior automobile search cases. Moreover, the new rule produces anomalous and unacceptable consequences.  *836 A The majority's argument that its decision is supported by our decisions in Carroll and <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> is misplaced.  The Court in Carroll upheld a warrantless search of an automobile for contraband on the basis of the impracticability of securing a warrant in cases involving the transportation of contraband goods.  The Court did not, however, suggest that obtaining a warrant for the search of an automobile is always impracticable.  [6] "In cases where the securing of a warrant is reasonably practicable, it must be used .  .  .  .  In cases where seizure is impossible except without warrant, the seizing officer acts unlawfully and at his peril unless he can show the court probable cause." 267 U. S., at 156 (emphasis added).  [7] As this Court reaffirmed in <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> , 399 U. S., *837 at 50, "[n]either Carroll, supra, nor other cases in this Court require or suggest that in every conceivable circumstance the search of an auto even with probable cause may be made without the extra protection for privacy that a warrant affords." Notwithstanding the reasoning of these cases, the majority argues that Carroll and <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> support its decisions because integral compartments of a car are functionally equivalent to containers found within a car, and because the practical advantages to the police of the Carroll doctrine "would be largely nullified if the permissible scope of a warrantless search of an automobile did not include containers and packages found inside the vehicle." Ante, at 820.  Neither of these arguments is persuasive.  First, the Court's argument that allowing warrantless searches of certain integral compartments of the car in Carroll and <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> , while protecting movable containers within the car, would be "illogical" and "absurd," ante, at 818, ignores the reason why this Court has allowed warrantless searches of automobile compartments.  Surely an integral compartment within a car is just as mobile, and presents the same practical problems of safekeeping, as the car itself.  This cannot be said of movable containers located within the car. The fact that there may be a high expectation of privacy in both containers and compartments is irrelevant, since the privacy rationale is not, and cannot be, the justification for the warrantless search of compartments.  The Court's second argument, which focuses on the practical advantages to police of the Carroll doctrine, fares no better.  The practical considerations which concerned the Carroll Court involved the difficulty of immobilizing a vehicle while a warrant must be obtained.  The Court had no occasion to address whether containers present the same practical difficulties as the car itself or integral compartments of the car. They do not.  See supra, at 832.

 The same legislation required a warrant for searches of dwelling places.  267 U. S., at 150-151 .  [7]  In particular, the Court noted an 1815 statute that permitted customs officers not only to board and search vessels without a warrant "but also to stop, search and examine any vehicle, beast or person on which or whom they should suspect there was merchandise which was subject to duty or had been introduced into the United States in any manner contrary to law." Id., at 151 .  [8]  In light of this established history, individuals always had been on notice that movable vessels may be stopped and searched on facts giving rise to probable cause that the vehicle contains contraband, without the protection afforded by a magistrate's prior evaluation of those facts.  [9]  Subsequent cases make clear that the decision in Carroll was not based on the fact that the only course available to the police was an immediate search.  As Justice Harlan later recognized, although a failure to seize a moving automobile believed to contain contraband might deprive officers of the illicit goods, once a vehicle itself has been stopped the exigency does not necessarily justify a warrantless search.  Chambers v. Maroney, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 42, 62-64</citedDecision> (opinion of Harlan, J.).  The Court in <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> , however  with only Justice Harlan dissenting  refused to adopt a rule that would permit a warrantless seizure but prohibit a warrantless search.  The Court held that if police officers have probable cause to justify a warrantless seizure of an automobile on a public roadway, they may conduct an immediate search of the contents of that vehicle.  "For constitutional purposes, we see no difference between on the one hand seizing and holding a car before presenting the probable cause issue to a magistrate and on the other hand carrying out an immediate search without a warrant.  Given probable cause to search, either course is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment." <citedDecision>Id., at 52</citedDecision> .  The Court also has held that if an immediate search on the street is permissible without a warrant, a search soon thereafter at the police station is permissible if the vehicle is impounded.  <citedDecision>Chambers, supra;</citedDecision> Texas v. White, 423 U. S. 67 .  These decisions are based on the practicalities of the situations presented and a realistic appraisal of the relatively minor protection that a contrary rule would provide for privacy interests.  Given the scope of the initial intrusion caused by a seizure of an automobile  which often could leave the occupants stranded on the highway  the Court rejected an inflexible rule that would force police officers in every case either to post guard at the vehicle while a warrant is obtained or to tow the vehicle itself to the station.  Similarly, if an immediate search on the scene could be conducted, but not one at the station if the vehicle is impounded, police often simply would search the vehicle on the street  at no advantage to the occupants, yet possibly at certain cost to the police.  The rules as applied in particular cases may appear unsatisfactory.  They reflect, however, a reasoned application of the more general rule that if an individual gives the police probable cause to believe a vehicle is transporting contraband, he loses the right to proceed on his way without official interference.  [10]  After reviewing the relevant authorities at some length, the Court concluded that the probable-cause requirement was satisfied in the case before it.  The Court held that "the facts and circumstances within [the officers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that intoxicating liquor was being transported in the automobile which they stopped and searched." 267 U. S., at 162 .  Cf. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176-177 ; Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98, 102 .  [11]  See Husty v. United States, 282 U. S. 694 ; Scher v. United States, 305 U. S. 251 ; Brinegar v. United States, supra ; Henry v. United States, supra ; Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U. S. 216 ; <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maroney, supra</citedDecision> ; Texas v. White, supra ; Colorado v. Bannister, 449 U. S. 1 .  Warrantless searches of automobiles have been upheld in a variety of factual contexts quite different from that presented in Carroll .  Cf. Cooper v. California, 386 U. S. 58 ; Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U. S. 433 ; South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364 .  Many of these searches do not require a showing of probable cause that the vehicle contains contraband.  We are not called upon to  and do not  consider in this case the scope of the warrantless search that is permitted in those cases. [12]  As the Court in Carroll concluded: "We here find the line of distinction between legal and illegal seizures of liquor in transport in vehicles.  It is certainly a reasonable distinction.  It gives the owner of an automobile or other vehicle seized under Section 26, in absence of probable cause, a right to have restored to him the automobile, it protects him under the Weeks [ Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 ] and Amos [ Amos v. United States, 255 U. S. 313 ] cases from use of the liquor as evidence against him, and it subjects the officer making the seizures to damages.

 `In countless cases in which warrants described only the land and the buildings, a search of desks, cabinets, closets and similar items has been permitted.' " 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 152 (1978) (quoting Massey v. Commonwealth, 305 S. W. 2d 755, 756 (Ky. 1957)).  [28]  The practical considerations that justify a warrantless search of an automobile continue to apply until the entire search of the automobile and its contents has been completed.  Arguably, the entire vehicle itself (including its upholstery) could be searched without a warrant, with all wrapped articles and containers found during that search then taken to a magistrate.  But prohibiting police from opening immediately a container in which the object of the search is most likely to be found and instead forcing them first to comb the entire vehicle would actually exacerbate the intrusion on privacy interests.  Moreover, until the container itself was opened the police could never be certain that the contraband was not secreted in a yet undiscovered portion of the vehicle; thus in every case in which a container was found, the vehicle would need to be secured while a warrant was obtained.  Such a requirement would be directly inconsistent with the rationale supporting the decisions in Carroll and <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> .  Cf. nn. 19 and 22, supra. [29]  Cf. 453 U. S., at 426-427 (plurality opinion); id., at 436 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting); id., at 443 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting); id., at 447 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  [30]  If the distinction is based on the proposition that the Fourth Amendment protects only those containers that objectively manifest an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy, however, the propriety of a warrantless search necessarily would turn on much more than the fabric of the container.  A paper bag stapled shut and marked "private" might be found to manifest a reasonable expectation of privacy, as could a cardboard box stacked on top of two pieces of heavy luggage.  The propriety of the warrantless search seemingly would turn on an objective appraisal of all the surrounding circumstances.  [31]  " `The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown.  It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storm may enter; the rain may enter; but the King of England cannot enter  all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement!'
**Combined Opinion**
 Although in other early cases containers may in fact have been searched, see ante, at 818-819, the parties did not litigate in this Court the question whether containers deserve separate protection.  The Court's suggestion that the absence of such an argument "illuminates the profession's understanding of the scope of the search permitted under Carroll , " ante, at 819, is an unusual approach to constitutional interpretation.  I would hesitate to rely upon the "profession's understanding" of the Fourteenth Amendment or of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), in the early part of this century as justification for not granting Negroes constitutional protection.  See Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954).  Moreover, for a number of reasons, including the broad scope of the permitted search incident to arrest prior to Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), and the uncertain meaning of a "search" prior to Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967), the profession formerly advanced different arguments against automobile searches than it advances today.  [8]  Seizures of automobiles can be distinguished because of the greater interest of defendants in continuing possession of their means of transportation; in the case of automobiles, a seizure is more likely to be a greater intrusion than an immediate search.  See Chambers v. Maroney, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 42, 51-52</citedDecision> (1970).  [9]  Both cases would appear to fall within the majority's new rule.  In United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977), federal agents had probable cause to search a footlocker.  Although the footlocker had been placed in the trunk of a car and the occupants were about to depart, the Court refused to rely on the automobile exception to uphold the search.  (It is true that the United States did not argue in this Court that the search was justified pursuant to that exception, but the theory was hardly so novel that this Court could not have responsibly relied upon it.) In Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753 (1979), too, the suitcase was mobile and police had probable cause to search it; it was carried in an automobile for several blocks before the automobile was stopped and the suitcase was seized and searched.  Again, however, this Court invalidated the search.
