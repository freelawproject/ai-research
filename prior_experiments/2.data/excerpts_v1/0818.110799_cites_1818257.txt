**Lead Opinion**
Having disposed of the just compensation claim, Justice Holmes turned very briefly to the other constitutional chal *947 lenges. In one paragraph, he rejected the Contract Clause claim. In the remaining paragraph of the opinion, he rejected all the other defenses. His treatment of the Commerce Clause challenge consists of three sentences: “A man cannot acquire a right to property by his desire to use it in commerce among the States. Neither can he enlarge his otherwise limited and qualified right to the same end. The case is covered in this respect by Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 [(1896)].” Ibid. While appellee relies upon Hudson County, appellants rest on our summary affirmance of a three-judge District Court judgment in City of Altus v. Carr, 255 F. Supp. 828 (WD Tex. ), summarily aff’d, 385 U. S. 35 (1966). The city of Altus is located near the southern border of Oklahoma. Large population increases rendered inadequate its source of municipal water. It consequently obtained from the owners of land in an adjoining Texas county the contractual right to pump the ground water underlying that land and to transport it across the border. The Texas Legislature thereafter enacted a statute that forbade the interstate exportation of ground water without the approval of that body. 7 The city filed suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the statute violated the Commerce Clause.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Therefore, it cannot be said that Neb. Rev. Stat. §46-613.01 (1978) either discriminates against, or “burdens,” interstate commerce. Section 46-613.01 is simply a regulation of the landowner’s right to use ground water extracted from lands he owns within Nebraska. 2 Unlike the Court, I cannot agree that Nebraska’s limitation upon a landowner’s right to extract water from his land situated in Nebraska for his own use on land he owns in an adjoining State runs afoul of Congress’ unexercised authority to regulate interstate commerce. 3 Similarly, in City of Altus v. Carr, 255 F. Supp. 828 (WD Tex. ), summarily aff’d, 385 U. S. 35 (1966), Texas placed no restrictions upon the use or the intrastate sale of ground water. The “rule in Texas was that an *964 owner of land could use all of the percolating water he could capture from the wells on his land for whatever beneficial purposes he needed it, on or off the land, and could likewise sell it to others for use on or off the land and outside the basin where produced, just as he could sell any other species of property.” 255 F. Supp., at 833, n. 8. Texas’ absolute ownership rule is an anomaly among the Western States. See 5 R. Clark, Waters and Water Rights §441 (1972 and 1978 Supp.). In Nebraska, as in most of the Western States, ground water is not treated as “any other species of property.” Unlike several other Western States, Nebraska does not entirely forbid ground water extracted in Nebraska to be used in other States.
