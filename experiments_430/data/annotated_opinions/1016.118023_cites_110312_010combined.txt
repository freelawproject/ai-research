 Because the plaintiff failed to prove that the statute did not serve that interest, the court held that he had not carried his burden of establishing a violation of the First Amendment.  In response to the dissent's argument that the court had placed the burden on the wrong party, the majority reasoned that the Twenty-first Amendment gave the statute "`an added presumption [of] validity.'" Id., at 732 .  Although that presumption had not been overcome in that case, the State Supreme Court assumed that in a future case the record might "support the proposition that these advertising restrictions do not further temperance objectives." Id., at 734 .  In Rhode Island Liquor Stores Assn. v. Evening Call Pub. Co., 497 A. 2d 331 , the plaintiff association [5] sought to enjoin the publisher of the local newspaper in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, from accepting advertisements disclosing the retail price of alcoholic beverages being sold across the state line in Millville, Massachusetts.  In upholding the injunction, the *492 State Supreme Court adhered to its reasoning in the Pastore case and rejected the argument that the statute neither "directly advanced" the state interest in promoting temperance, nor was "more extensive than necessary to serve that interest" as required by this Court's decision in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., <citedDecision>447 U. S. 557, 563</citedDecision> (1980).  It assumed the existence of other, "perhaps more effective means" of achieving the State's "goal of temperance," but concluded that it was "not unreasonable for the State of Rhode Island to believe that price advertising will result in increased sales of alcoholic beverages generally." Rhode Island Liquor Stores Assn. v. Evening Call Pub. Co., 497 A. 2d, at 336 .  II Petitioners 44 Liquormart, Inc. (44 Liquormart), and Peoples Super Liquor Stores, Inc. (Peoples), are licensed retailers of alcoholic beverages.  Petitioner 44 Liquormart operates a store in Rhode Island and petitioner Peoples operates several stores in Massachusetts that are patronized by Rhode Island residents.  Peoples uses alcohol price advertising extensively in Massachusetts, where such advertising is permitted, but Rhode Island newspapers and other media outlets have refused to accept such ads.  Complaints from competitors about an advertisement placed by 44 Liquormart in a Rhode Island newspaper in 1991 generated enforcement proceedings that in turn led to the initiation of this litigation.

 Our opinion noted that the greater "objectivity" of commercial speech justifies affording the State more freedom to distinguish false commercial advertisements from true ones, ibid., and that the greater "hardiness" of commercial speech, inspired as it is by the profit motive, likely diminishes the chilling effect that may attend its regulation, ibid. Subsequent cases explained that the State's power to regulate commercial transactions justifies its concomitant power to regulate commercial speech that is "linked inextricably" to those transactions.  Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U. S. 1, 10, n. 9 (1979); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 456 (1978) (commercial speech "occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation").  As one commentator has explained: "The entire commercial speech doctrine, after all, represents an accommodation between the right to speak and hear expression about goods and services and the right of government to regulate the sales of such goods and services." L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 12-15, p. 903 (2d ed. 1988).  Nevertheless, as we explained in Linmark, the State retains less regulatory authority when its commercial speech restrictions strike at "the substance of the information communicated" rather than the "commercial aspect of [it]with offerors communicating offers to offerees." 431 U. S., at 96; Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U. S., at 701, n. 28.  In Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., <citedDecision>447 U. S. 557</citedDecision> (1980), we took stock of our developing commercial speech jurisprudence.  In that case, we considered a regulation "completely" banning all promotional advertising by electric utilities.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Our decision acknowledged the special features of commercial speech but identified the serious First Amendment concerns that attend blanket advertising prohibitions that do not protect consumers from commercial harms.  *500 Five Members of the Court recognized that the state interest in the conservation of energy was substantial, and that there was "an immediate connection between advertising and demand for electricity." <citedDecision>Id., at 569</citedDecision> .  Nevertheless, they concluded that the regulation was invalid because respondent commission had failed to make a showing that a more limited speech regulation would not have adequately served the State's interest.  <citedDecision>Id., at 571</citedDecision> .  [9] In reaching its conclusion, the majority explained that although the special nature of commercial speech may require less than strict review of its regulation, special concerns arise from "regulations that entirely suppress commercial speech in order to pursue a nonspeech-related policy." <citedDecision>Id., at 566, n. 9</citedDecision> .  In those circumstances, "a ban on speech could screen from public view the underlying governmental policy." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> As a result, the Court concluded that "special care" should attend the review of such blanket bans, and it pointedly remarked that "in recent years this Court has not approved a blanket ban on commercial speech unless the expression itself was flawed in some way, either because it was deceptive or related to unlawful activity." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> [10] *501 IV As our review of the case law reveals, Rhode Island errs in concluding that all commercial speech regulations are subject to a similar form of constitutional review simply because they target a similar category of expression.  The mere fact that messages propose commercial transactions does not in and of itself dictate the constitutional analysis that should apply to decisions to suppress them.  See Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 491-494 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  When a State regulates commercial messages to protect consumers from misleading, deceptive, or aggressive sales practices, or requires the disclosure of beneficial consumer information, the purpose of its regulation is consistent with the reasons for according constitutional protection to commercial speech and therefore justifies less than strict review.  However, when a State entirely prohibits the dissemination of truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of a fair bargaining process, there is far less reason to depart from the rigorous review that the First Amendment generally demands.  Sound reasons justify reviewing the latter type of commercial speech regulation more carefully.  Most obviously, complete speech bans, unlike content-neutral restrictions on the time, place, or manner of expression, see Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 89 (1949), are particularly dangerous because they all but foreclose alternative means of disseminating certain information.
**Combined Opinion**
 Regulations that suppress the truth are no less troubling because they target objectively verifiable information, nor are they less effective because they aim at durable messages.  As a result, neither the "greater objectivity" nor the "greater hardiness" of truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech justifies reviewing its complete suppression with added deference.  Ibid. It is the State's interest in protecting consumers from "commercial harms" that provides "the typical reason why commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial speech." Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 426 (1993).  Yet bans *503 that target truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages rarely protect consumers from such harms.  [12] Instead, such bans often serve only to obscure an "underlying governmental policy" that could be implemented without regulating speech.  Central Hudson, <citedDecision>447 U. S., at 566, n. 9</citedDecision> .  In this way, these commercial speech bans not only hinder consumer choice, but also impede debate over central issues of public policy.  See <citedDecision>id., at 575</citedDecision> (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).  [13] Precisely because bans against truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech rarely seek to protect consumers from either deception or overreaching, they usually rest solely on the offensive assumption that the public will respond "irrationally" to the truth.  Linmark, 431 U. S., at 96 .  The First Amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good.  That teaching applies equally to state attempts to deprive consumers of accurate information about their chosen products: "The commercial marketplace, like other spheres of our social and cultural life, provides a forum where ideas and information flourish.  Some of the ideas and information are vital, some of slight worth.  But the general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the government, *504 assess the value of the information presented.  Thus, even a communication that does no more than propose a commercial transaction is entitled to the coverage of the First Amendment.  See Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 762." Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 767 (1993).  See also Linmark, 431 U. S., at 96 (1977); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 497-498 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 12-2, at 790, and n. 11.  V In this case, there is no question that Rhode Island's price advertising ban constitutes a blanket prohibition against truthful, nonmisleading speech about a lawful product.  There is also no question that the ban serves an end unrelated to consumer protection.  Accordingly, we must review the price advertising ban with "special care," Central Hudson, <citedDecision>447 U. S., at 566, n. 9</citedDecision> , mindful that speech prohibitions of this type rarely survive constitutional review, <citedDecision>ibid.</citedDecision> The State argues that the price advertising prohibition should nevertheless be upheld because it directly advances the State's substantial interest in promoting temperance, and because it is no more extensive than necessary.  Cf. <citedDecision>id., at 566</citedDecision> .  Although there is some confusion as to what Rhode Island means by temperance, we assume that the State asserts an interest in reducing alcohol consumption.  [14] *505 In evaluating the ban's effectiveness in advancing the State's interest, we note that a commercial speech regulation "may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose." <citedDecision>Id., at 564</citedDecision> .  For that reason, the State bears the burden of showing not merely that its regulation will advance its interest, but also that it will do so "to a material degree." Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 771 ; see also Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 486-488 .  The need for the State to make such a showing is particularly great given the drastic nature of its chosen meansthe wholesale suppression of truthful, nonmisleading information.  Accordingly, we must determine whether the State has shown that the price advertising ban will significantly reduce alcohol consumption.  We can agree that common sense supports the conclusion that a prohibition against price advertising, like a collusive agreement among competitors to refrain from such advertising, [15] will tend to mitigate competition and maintain prices at a higher level than would prevail in a completely free market.  Despite the absence of proof on the point, we can even agree with the State's contention that it is reasonable to assume that demand, and hence consumption throughout the market, is somewhat lower whenever a higher, noncompetitive price level prevails.

 829 F. Supp., at 549 .  Per capita purchases could be limited as is the case with prescription drugs.  Even educational campaigns focused on the problems of excessive, or even moderate, drinking might prove to be more effective.  As a result, even under the less than strict standard that generally applies in commercial speech cases, the State has failed to establish a "reasonable fit" between its abridgment of speech and its temperance goal.  Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989); see also *508 Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 491 (explaining that defects in a federal ban on alcohol advertising are "further highlighted by the availability of alternatives that would prove less intrusive to the First Amendment's protections for commercial speech"); Linmark, 431 U. S., at 97 (suggesting that the State use financial incentives or counterspeech, rather than speech restrictions, to advance its interests).  It necessarily follows that the price advertising ban cannot survive the more stringent constitutional review that Central Hudson itself concluded was appropriate for the complete suppression of truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech.  <citedDecision>447 U. S., at 566, n. 9</citedDecision> .  VI The State responds by arguing that it merely exercised appropriate "legislative judgment" in determining that a price advertising ban would best promote temperance.  Relying on the Central Hudson analysis set forth in Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328 (1986), and United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418 (1993), Rhode Island first argues that, because expert opinions as to the effectiveness of the price advertising ban "go both ways," the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the ban constituted a "reasonable choice" by the legislature.  39 F. 3d, at 7 .  The State next contends that precedent requires us to give particular deference to that legislative choice because the State could, if it chose, ban the sale of alcoholic beverages outright.  See Posadas, 478 U. S., at 345-346 .  Finally, the State argues that deference is appropriate because alcoholic beverages are so-called "vice" products.
**Combined Opinion**
 Perhaps more relevant still are the state legislative practices at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, since it is most improbable that that adoption was meant to overturn any existing national consensus regarding free speech.  Indeed, it is rare that any nationwide practice would develop contrary to a proper understanding of the First Amendment *518 itselffor which reason I think also relevant any national consensus that had formed regarding state regulation of advertising after the Fourteenth Amendment, and before this Court's entry into the field.  The parties and their amici provide no evidence on these points.  Since I do not believe we have before us the wherewithal to declare Central Hudson wrongor at least the wherewithal to say what ought to replace itI must resolve this case in accord with our existing jurisprudence, which all except JUSTICE THOMAS agree would prohibit the challenged regulation.  I am not disposed to develop new law, or reinforce old, on this issue, and accordingly I merely concur in the judgment of the Court. I believe, however, that JUSTICE STEVENS'S treatment of the application of the Twenty-first Amendment to this case is correct, and accordingly join Parts I, II, VII, and VIII of Justice Stevens's opinion.  JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in Parts I, II, VI, and VII, and concurring in the judgment.  In cases such as this, in which the government's asserted interest is to keep legal users of a product or service ignorant in order to manipulate their choices in the marketplace, the balancing test adopted in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., <citedDecision>447 U. S. 557</citedDecision> (1980), should not be applied, in my view.  Rather, such an "interest" is per se illegitimate and can no more justify regulation of "commercial" speech than it can justify regulation of "non-commercial" speech.  I In Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 762 (1976), this Court held that speech that does "`no more than propose a commercial transaction'" was protected by the First Amendment, and struck down a ban on price advertising regarding prescription drugs.  The Court asserted that a "particular consumer's interest in the free flow of commercial information" may *519 be as keen as, or keener than, his interest in "the day's most urgent political debate," id., at 763 , and that "the proper allocation of resources" in our free enterprise system requires that consumer decisions be "intelligent and well informed," id., at 765 .  The Court also explained that, unless consumers are kept informed about the operations of the free market system, they cannot form "intelligent opinions as to how that system ought to be regulated or altered." Ibid. See also id., at 765-766, nn. 19-20 .  [1] The Court sharply rebuffed the State's argument that consumers would make irresponsible choices if they were able to choose between higher priced but higher quality pharmaceuticals accompanied by high quality prescription monitoring services resulting from a "stable pharmacist-customer relationshi[p]," id., at 768 , on the one hand, and cheaper but lower quality pharmaceuticals unaccompanied by such services, on the other: "[T]he State's protectiveness of its citizens rests in large measure on the advantages of their being kept in ignorance.
**Combined Opinion**
 The Court opined that false or misleading advertising was not protected, on the grounds that the accuracy of advertising claims may be more readily verifiable than is the accuracy of political or other claims, and that "commercial" speech is made more durable by its profit motive.  Id., at 771 , and n. 24.  The Court also made clear that it did not envision protection for advertising that proposes an illegal transaction.  Id., at 772-773 (distinguishing Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376 (1973)).  In case after case following Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy , the Court, and individual Members of the Court, have continued to stress the importance of free dissemination of information about commercial choices in a market economy; the antipaternalistic premises of the First Amendment; the impropriety of manipulating consumer choices or public opinion through the suppression of accurate "commercial" information; the near impossibility of severing "commercial" speech from speech necessary to democratic decisionmaking; and the dangers of permitting the government to do covertly what it might not have been able to muster the political support to do openly.  [2] *521 In other decisions, however, the Court has appeared to accept the legitimacy of laws that suppress information in order to manipulate the choices of consumersso long as the government could show that the manipulation was in fact successful.  Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., <citedDecision>447 U. S. 557</citedDecision> (1980), was the first decision to clearly embrace this position, although the Court applied a very strict overbreadth analysis to strike down the advertising ban at issue.  [3] In two other decisions, Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328 (1986), and United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418 (1993), the Court simply presumed that advertising of a product or service leads to increased consumption; since, as in Central Hudson, the Court saw nothing impermissible in the government's suppressing information in order to discourage consumption, it upheld the advertising restrictions *522 in those cases. Posadas, supra, at 341-342 ; Edge, supra, at 425, 433-434.  The Court has at times appeared to assume that "commercial" speech could be censored in a variety of ways for any of a variety of reasons because, as was said without clear rationale in some post- Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy cases, such speech was in a "subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values," Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 456 (1978); Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 478 (1989); Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 623 (1995), or of "less constitutional moment," <citedDecision>Central Hudson, supra, at 562-563, n. 5</citedDecision> .  But see Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 418-419 (1993) (rejecting this assertion); id., at 431 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (same).  I do not see a philosophical or historical basis for asserting that "commercial" speech is of "lower value" than "noncommercial" speech.  Indeed, some historical materials suggest to the contrary.  See, e. g., ante, at 495-496 (citing Franklin's Apology for Printers); Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733 (1878) (dictum that Congress could not, consistent with freedom of the press, prevent the circulation of lottery advertising through methods other than the United States mail); see also In re Rapier, 143 U. S. 110, 134-135 (1892) (continuing to assume that freedom of the press prevents Congress from prohibiting circulation of newspapers containing lottery advertisements); Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan, 229 U. S. 288, 315 (1913) (same); see generally Brief for American Advertising Federation et al. as Amici Curiae 12-24 (citing authorities for propositions that commercial activity and advertising were integral to life in colonial America and that Framers' political philosophy equated liberty and property and did not distinguish between commercial and noncommercial messages).  Nor do I believe that the only explanations that the Court has ever advanced for treating "commercial" speech differently from other speech can justify restricting "commercial" speech in *523 order to keep information from legal purchasers so as to thwart what would otherwise be their choices in the marketplace.  [4] II I do not join the principal opinion's application of the Central Hudson balancing test because I do not believe that such a test should be applied to a restriction of "commercial" speech, at least when, as here, the asserted interest is one that is to be achieved through keeping would-be recipients of the speech in the dark.
**Combined Opinion**
 The State's only asserted justification for this ban is that it promotes temperance by increasing the cost of alcoholic beverages.  Brief for Respondent State of Rhode Island 22.  I agree with the Court that Rhode Island's price-advertising ban is invalid.  I would resolve this case more narrowly, however, by applying our established Central Hudson test to determine whether this commercial speech regulation survives First Amendment scrutiny.  Under that test, we first determine whether the speech at issue concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, and whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.  If both these conditions are met, we must decide whether the regulation "directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest." Central Hudson Gas & Elec. *529 Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., <citedDecision>447 U. S. 557, 566</citedDecision> (1980).  Given the means by which this regulation purportedly serves the State's interest, our conclusion is plain: Rhode Island's regulation fails First Amendment scrutiny.  Both parties agree that the first two prongs of the Central Hudson test are met. Even if we assume, arguendo, that Rhode Island's regulation also satisfies the requirement that it directly advance the governmental interest, Rhode Island's regulation fails the final prong; that is, its ban is more extensive than necessary to serve the State's interest.  As we have explained, in order for a speech restriction to pass muster under the final prong, there must be a fit between the legislature's goal and method, "a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served." Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).  While the State need not employ the least restrictive means to accomplish its goal, the fit between means and ends must be "narrowly tailored." Ibid. The scope of the restriction on speech must be reasonably, though it need not be perfectly, targeted to address the harm intended to be regulated.

 [9]  In other words, the regulation failed the fourth step in the four-part inquiry that the majority announced in its opinion.  It wrote: "In commercial speech cases, then, a four-part analysis has developed.  At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment.  For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.  Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.  If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest." Central Hudson, <citedDecision>447 U. S., at 566</citedDecision> .  [10]  The Justices concurring in the judgment adopted a somewhat broader view.  They expressed "doubt whether suppression of information concerning the availability and price of a legally offered product is ever a permissible way for the State to `dampen' the demand for or use of the product." <citedDecision>Id., at 574</citedDecision> .  Indeed, Justice Blackmun believed that even "though `commercial' speech is involved, such a regulation strikes at the heart of the First Amendment." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> [11]  "Florida permits lawyers to advertise on prime-time television and radio as well as in newspapers and other media.  They may rent space on billboards.  They may send untargeted letters to the general population, or to discrete segments thereof.

See generally Rule 4-7.2(a), Rules Regulating The Florida Bar (`[A] lawyer may advertise services through public media, such as a telephone directory, legal directory, newspaper or other periodical, billboards, and other signs, radio, television, and recorded messages the public may access by dialing a telephone number, or through written communication not involving solicitation as defined in rule 4-7.4'); The Florida Bar: Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating The Florida BarAdvertising Issues, 571 So. 2d, at 461." 515 U.

[3]  The Court found that although the total effect of the advertising ban would be to decrease consumption, the advertising ban impermissibly extended to some advertising that itself might not increase consumption.  <citedDecision>Central Hudson, supra, at 569-571</citedDecision> .  [4]  As noted above, the asserted rationales for differentiating "commercial" speech from other speech are (1) that the truth of "commercial" speech is supposedly more verifiable, and (2) that "commercial speech, the offspring of economic self-interest" is supposedly a "hardy breed of expression that is not particularly susceptible to being crushed by overbroad regulation." <citedDecision>Central Hudson, supra, at 564, n. 6</citedDecision> (internal quotation marks omitted).  The degree to which these rationales truly justify treating "commercial" speech differently from other speech (or indeed, whether the requisite distinction can even be drawn) is open to question, in my view.  See Kozinski & Banner, Who's Afraid of Commercial Speech, 76 Va. L. Rev. 627 , 634-638 (1990) (questioning basis for drawing distinction); id., at 638-650 (questioning coherence of distinction).  In any event, neither of these rationales provides any basis for permitting government to keep citizens ignorant as a means of manipulating their choices in the commercial or political marketplace.  [5]  In other words, I do not believe that a Central Hudson -type balancing test should apply when the asserted purpose is like the one put forth by the government in Central Hudson itself.  Whether some type of balancing test is warranted when the asserted state interest is of a different kind is a question that I do not consider here.  [6] E. g., Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, 507 U. S., at 417, n. 13 (commercial speech restrictions impermissible if alternatives are "numerous" and obvious).
