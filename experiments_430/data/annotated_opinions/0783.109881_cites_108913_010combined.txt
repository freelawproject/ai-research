 CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT *660 Oscar Chase argued the cause for petitioners.  With him on the briefs were Nancy Stearns, Jack Greenberg, and Eric Schnapper.  L. Kevin Sheridan argued the cause for respondents.  With him on the brief was W. Bernard Richland.  [*] MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court. Petitioners, a class of female employees of the Department of Social Services and of the Board of Education of the city of New York, commenced this action under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 in July 1971.  [1] The gravamen of the complaint was that the *661 Board and the Department had as a matter of official policy compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were required for medical reasons.  [2] Cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, <citedDecision>414 U. S. 632</citedDecision> (1974).  The suit sought injunctive relief and backpay for periods of unlawful forced leave.  Named as defendants in the action were the Department and its Commissioner, the Board and its Chancellor, and the city of New York and its Mayor.  In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.  [3] On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held moot petitioners' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief since the city of New York and the Board, after the filing of the complaint, had changed their policies relating to maternity leaves so that no pregnant employee would have to take leave unless she was medically unable to continue to perform her job.  394 F. Supp. 853, 855 (1975).  No one now challenges this conclusion.  *662 The court did conclude, however, that the acts complained of were unconstitutional under <citedDecision>LaFleur, supra.</citedDecision> 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  Nonetheless plaintiffs' prayers for backpay were denied because any such damages would come ultimately from the city of New York and, therefore, to hold otherwise would be to "circumven[t]" the immunity conferred on municipalities by Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961).  See 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  On appeal, petitioners renewed their arguments that the Board of Education [4] was not a "municipality" within the meaning of Monroe v. Pape, supra , and that, in any event, the District Court had erred in barring a damages award against the individual defendants.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions.  The court first held that the Board of Education was not a "person" under § 1983 because "it performs a vital governmental function .  .

 Focusing new light on 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , that decision widened access to the federal courts and permitted expansive interpretations of the reach of *705 the 1871 measure.  But Monroe exempted local governments from liability at the same time it opened wide the courthouse door to suits against officers and employees of those entitieseven when they act pursuant to express authorization.  The oddness of this result, and the weakness of the historical evidence relied on by the Monroe Court in support of it, are well demonstrated by the Court's opinion today.  Yet the gravity of overruling a part of so important a decision prompts me to write.  I In addressing a complaint alleging unconstitutional police conduct that probably was unauthorized and actionable under state law, [1] the Monroe Court treated the 42d Congress' rejection of the Sherman amendment as conclusive evidence of an intention to immunize local governments from all liability under the statute for constitutional injury.  That reading, in light of today's thorough canvass of the legislative history, clearly "misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision," Monroe, supra, at 192 (Harlan, J., concurring).  In this case, involving formal, written policies of the Department of Social Services and the Board of Education of the city of New York that are alleged to conflict *706 with the command of the Due Process Clause, cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, <citedDecision>414 U. S. 632</citedDecision> (1974), the Court decides "not to reject [wisdom] merely because it comes late," Henslee v. Union Planters Bank, 335 U. S. 595, 600 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  As the Court demonstrates, the Sherman amendment presented an extreme example of "riot act" legislation that sought to impose vicarious liability on government subdivisions for the consequences of private lawlessness.  As such, it implicated concerns that are of marginal pertinence to the operative principle of § 1 of the 1871 legislationnow § 1983that "any person" acting "under color of" state law may be held liable for affirmative conduct that "subjects, or causes to be subjected, any person .  .  .  to the deprivation of any" federal constitutional or statutory right.  Of the many reasons for the defeat of the Sherman proposal, none supports Monroe 's observation that the 42d Congress was fundamentally "antagonistic," 365 U. S., at 191 , to the proposition that government entities and natural persons alike should be held accountable for the consequences of conduct directly working a constitutional violation.

 Although there was an independent basis of jurisdiction in many of the school board cases because of the inclusion of individual public officials as nominal parties, the opinions of this Court make explicit reference to the school board party, particularly in discussions of the relief to be awarded, see, e. g., Green v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430, 437-439, 441-442 (1968); Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 292-293 (1977) (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment).  And, as the Court points out, ante, at 696-697, and nn. 62, 63, Congress has focused specifically on this Court's school board decisions in several statutes.  Thus the exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction over school boards, while perhaps not premised on considered holdings, has been longstanding.  Indeed, it predated Monroe .  Even if one attempts to explain away the school board decisions as involving suits which "may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either § 1983 or Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908)," post, at 716-717, n. 2, some difficulty remains in rationalizing the relevant body of precedents.  At least two of the school board cases involved claims for monetary relief.  Cohen v. Chesterfield County School Board, 326 F. Supp. 1159, 1161 (ED Va. 1971), rev'd, 474 F. 2d 395 (CA4 1973), rev'd and remanded, <citedDecision>414 U. S. 632</citedDecision> (1974); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 504 (1969).  See also Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U. S. 441, 445 (1973).  Although the point was not squarely presented in this Court, these claims *712 for damages could not have been maintained in official-capacity suits if the government entity were not itself suable.  Cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974).  [8] Moreover, the rationale of Kenosha would have to be disturbed to avoid closing all avenues under § 1983 to injunctive relief against constitutional violations by local government.  The Court of Appeals in this case suggested that we import, by analogy, the Eleventh Amendment fiction of Ex parte Young into § 1983, 532 F. 2d 259, 264-266 (CA2 1976).  That approach, however, would create tension with Kenosha because it would require "a bifurcated application" of "the generic word `person' in § 1983" to public officials "depending on the nature of the relief sought against them."

 The plaintiffs further alleged that the Board had a policy of requiring women to take maternity leave after the seventh month of pregnancy unless that month fell in the last month of the school year, in which case the teacher could remain through the end of the school term.

Pape insofar as it holds that the doctrine of respondeat superior is not a basis for rendering municipalities liable under § 1983 for the constitutional torts of their employees.  See Part II, infra.  [8]  We expressly declined to consider "policy considerations" for or against municipal liability.  See 365 U. S., at 191.  [9]  Mr. Justice Douglas, the author of Monroe, has suggested that the municipal exclusion might more properly rest on a theory that Congress sought to prevent the financial ruin that civil rights liability might impose on municipalities.
