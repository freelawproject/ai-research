 *176 Moreover, and unlike the relief problem, this phenomenon does not admit of diverse treatment by the several States.  The prohibition against transporting indigent non-residents into one State is an open invitation to retaliatory measures, and the burdens upon the transportation of such persons become cumulative.  Moreover, it would be a virtual impossibility for migrants and those who transport them to acquaint themselves with the peculiar rules of admission of many States.  “This Court has repeatedly declared that the grant [the commerce clause] established the immunity of interstate commerce from the control of the States respecting all those subjects embraced within the grant which are of such a nature as to demand that, if regulated at all, their regulation must be prescribed by a single authority.” Milk Control Board v. Eisenberg Farm Products, 306 U. S. 346, 351 .  We are of the opinion that the transportation of indigent persons from State to State clearly falls within this class of subjects.  The scope of Congressional power to deal with this problem we are not now called upon to decide.  There remains to be noticed only the contention that the limitation upon State power to interfere with the interstate transportation of persons is subject to an exception in the case of “paupers.” It is true that support for this contention may be found in early decisions of this Court. In City of New York v. Miln, <citedDecision>11 Pet. 102, at 143</citedDecision> , it was said that it is “as competent and as necessary for a State to provide precautionary measures against the moral pestilence of paupers, vagabonds, and possibly convicts, as it is to guard against the physical pestilence, which may arise from unsound and infectious articles imported, .  .  .” This language has been casually repeated in numerous later cases up to the turn of the century.  See, e. g., Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283 , 426 and 466-67; Railway Company v. Husen, 96 U. S. 465, 471 ; Plumley v. Massachusetts, 155 U. S. 461, 478 ; Missouri, K. & T. Ry. *177 Co. v. Haber, 169 U. S. 613, 629 .  In none of these cases, however, was the power of a State to exclude “paupers” actually involved.  Whether an able-bodied but unemployed person like Duncan is a “pamper” within the historical meaning of the term is open to considerable doubt.  See 53 Harvard L. Rev. 1031, 1032.  But assuming that the term is applicable to him and to persons similarly situated, we do not consider ourselves bound by the language referred to.  <citedDecision>City of New York</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Miln</citedDecision> was decided in 1837.  Whatever may have been the notion then prevailing, we do not think that it will now be seriously contended that because a person is without employment and without funds he constitutes a “moral pestilence.” Poverty and immorality are not synonymous.  We are of the opinion that § 2615 is not a valid exercise of the police power of California; that it imposes an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce, and that the conviction under it cannot be sustained.  In the view we have taken it is unnecessary to decide whether the Section is repugnant to other provisions of the Constitution.  Reversed.  Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, 114 U.
