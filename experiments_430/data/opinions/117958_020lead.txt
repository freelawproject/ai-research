<author id="b553-10">Justice Scalia</author>
<p id="A8E">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b553-11">In the trial at issue here, respondent was convicted of making material false statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, in violation of <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 1001</span>. The question presented is whether it was constitutional for the trial judge to refuse to submit the question of “materiality” to the jury.</p>
<p id="b553-12">I</p>
<p id="b553-13">In the 1980’s, respondent engaged in a number of real estate transactions financed by loans insured by the Federal <page-number citation-index="1" label="508">*508</page-number>Housing Administration (FHA), an agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).. Respondent would purchase rental housing, renovate it, obtain an inflated appraisal, and sell it to a “straw buyer” (a friend or relative), for whom respondent would arrange an FHA-insured mortgage loan. Then, as prearranged, respondent would repurchase the property (at a small profit to the straw buyer) and assume the mortgage loan. Twenty-nine of these ventures went into default.</p>
<p id="b554-5">Respondent was charged by federal indictment with, among other things, multiple counts of making false statements on federal loan documents in violation of <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. §1001</span>. Two of these counts charged that respondent had made false statements on HUD/FHA form 92800-5 by knowingly inflating the appraised value of the mortgaged property. The other false-statement counts charged that respondent had made misrepresentations on HUD/FHA form HUD-1, the settlement form used in closing the sales of the properties. Line 303 of this form requires disclosure of the closing costs to be paid or received by the borrower/buyer and the seller. The forms executed by respondent showed that the buyer was to pay some of the closing costs, whereas in fact he, the seller, had arranged to pay all of them. To prove the materiality of these false statements, the Government offered the testimony of several persons charged with administering FHA/HUD programs, who explained why the requested information was important.</p>
<p id="b554-6">At the close of the evidence, the United States District Court for the District of Montana instructed the jury that, to convict respondent, the Government was required to prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that the alleged false statements were material to the activities and decisions of HUD. But, the court further instructed, “[t]he issue of materiality ... is not submitted to you for your decision but rather is a matter for the decision of the court. You are instructed that the statements charged in the indictment are material statements.” <page-number citation-index="1" label="509">*509</page-number>App. 24, 29. The jury convicted respondent of the §1001 charges.</p>
<p id="b555-9">A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed these convictions because Circuit precedent dictated that materiality in a §1001 prosecution be decided by the jury. <span class="citation" data-id="610844"><a href="/opinion/610844/united-states-v-michael-e-gaudin/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Michael E. Gaudin">997 F. 2d 1267</a></span> (1993). On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals stood by this precedent. It held that taking the question of materiality from the jury denied respondent a right guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <span class="citation" data-id="673512"><a href="/opinion/673512/united-states-v-michael-e-gaudin/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b555-3">II</p>
<p id="ABz">Section 1001 of Title 18 provides:</p>
<blockquote id="b555-4">“Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.”</blockquote>
<p id="b555-5">It is uncontested that conviction under this provision requires that the statements be “material” to the Government inquiry, and that “materiality” is an element of the offense that the Government must prove. The parties also agree on the definition of “materiality”: The statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.” <em>Kungys </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112052"><a href="/opinion/112052/kungys-v-united-states/#770" aria-description="Citation for case: Kungys v. United States">485 U. S. 759, 770</a></span> (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). The question for our resolution is whether respondent was entitled to have this element of the crime determined by the jury.</p>
<p id="b555-6">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that no one will be deprived of liberty without <page-number citation-index="1" label="510">*510</page-number>“due process of law”; and the Sixth, that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury.” We have held that these provisions require criminal convictions to rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112868"><a href="/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/#277" aria-description="Citation for case: Sullivan v. Louisiana">508 U. S. 275, 277-278</a></span> (1993). The right to have a jury make the ultimate determination of guilt has an impressive pedigree. Blackstone described “trial by jury” as requiring that <em>“the truth of every accusation, </em>whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant’s] equals and neighbors ....” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769) (emphasis added). Justice Story wrote that the “trial by jury” guaranteed by the Constitution was “generally understood to mean ... a trial by a jury of twelve men, impartially selected, who must unanimously <em>concur in the guilt of the accused before a legal conviction can be had” </em>2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 541, n. 2 (4th ed. 1873) (emphasis added and deleted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This right was designed “to guard against a <page-number citation-index="1" label="511">*511</page-number>spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of rulers,” and “was from very early times insisted on by our ancestors in the parent country, as the great bulwark of their civil and political- liberties.” <em>Id., </em>at 540-541. See also <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/#151" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v.

<p id="b557-5">Ill</p>
<p id="b557-6">Thus far, the resolution of the question before us seems simple. The Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to demand that a jury find him guilty of all the elements of the crime with which he is charged; one of the elements in the present case is materiality; respondent therefore had a right to have the jury decide materiality. To escape the force of this logic, the Government offers essentially three arguments. Having conceded the minor premise — that materiality is an element of the offense — the Government argues first, that the major premise is flawed; second, that (essentially) a page of history is worth a volume of logic, and uniform practice simply excludes the element of materiality from the syllogism; and third, that <em>stare decisis </em>requires the judgment here to be reversed.</p>
<p id="b557-7">A</p>
<p id="b557-8">As to the first, the Government’s position is that “materiality,” whether as a matter of logic or history, is a “legal” question, and that although we have sometimes spoken of “requiring the jury to decide ‘all the elements of a criminal offense,’ <em>e. g., Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>[<span class="citation" data-id="112660"><a href="/opinion/112660/estelle-v-mcguire/#69" aria-description="Citation for case: Estelle v. McGuire">502 U. S. 62, 69</a></span>] (1991); see <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>[<span class="citation" data-id="117831"><a href="/opinion/117831/victor-v-nebraska/#5" aria-description="Citation for case: Victor v. Nebraska">511 U. S. 1, 5</a></span>] (1994); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109698"><a href="/opinion/109698/patterson-v-new-york/#210" aria-description="Citation for case: Patterson v. New York">432 U. S. 197, 210</a></span> (1977), the principle actually applies to <em>only the factual components </em>of the essential elements.” Brief for United States 33 (emphasis added). The Government claims that this understanding of the jury’s role <page-number citation-index="1" label="512">*512</page-number>dates back to <em>Sparf </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="94082"><a href="/opinion/94082/sparf-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sparf v. United States">156 U. S. 51</a></span> (1895), and is reaffirmed by recent decisions of this Court.</p>
<p id="b558-5">By limiting the jury’s constitutionally prescribed role to “the factual components of the essential elements” the Government surely does not mean to concede that the jury must pass upon all elements that contain <em>some </em>factual component, for that test is amply met here. Deciding whether a statement is “material” requires the determination of at least two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a) “what statement was made?” and (b) “what decision was the agency trying to make?” The ultimate question: (c) “whether the statement was material to the decision,” requires applying the legal standard of materiality (quoted above) to these historical facts. What the Government apparently argues is that the Constitution requires only that (a) and (b) be determined by the jury, and that (c) may be determined by the judge. We see two difficulties with this. First, the application-of-legal-standard-to-fact sort of question posed by (c), commonly called a “mixed question of law and fact,” has typically been resolved by juries. See J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at Common Law 194, 249-250 (1898). Indeed, our cases have recognized in other contexts that the materiality inquiry, involving as it does “delicate assessments of the inferences a ‘reasonable [decisionmaker]’ would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him,... [is] peculiarly on[e] for the trier of fact.” <em>TSC Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Northway, Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="109481"><a href="/opinion/109481/tsc-industries-inc-v-northway-inc/#450" aria-description="Citation for case: TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.">426 U. S. 438, 450</a></span> (1976) (securities fraud); <em>McLanahan </em>v. <em>Universal Ins. Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="85573"><a href="/opinion/85573/mlanahan-v-the-universal-insurance-company/#188" aria-description="Citation for case: M&#x27;lanahan v. the Universal Insurance Company">1 Pet. 170, 188-189, 191</a></span> (1828) (materiality of false statements in insurance applications).</p>
<p id="b558-6">The second difficulty with the Government’s position is that it has absolutely no historical support. If it were true, the lawbooks would be full of cases, regarding materiality and innumerable other “mixed-law-and-fact” issues, in which the criminal jury was required to come forth with “findings of fact” pertaining to each of the essential elements, leaving <page-number citation-index="1" label="513">*513</page-number>it to the judge to apply the law to those facts and render the ultimate verdict of “guilty” or “not guilty.” We know of no such case. Juries at the time of the framing could not be forced to produce mere “factual findings,” but were entitled to deliver a general verdict pronouncing the defendant’s guilt or innocence. Morgan, A Brief History of Special Verdicts and Special Interrogatories, 32 Yale L. J. 575, 591 (1922). See also G. Clementson, Special Verdicts and Special Findings by Juries 49 (1905); Alschuler &amp; Deiss, A Brief History of the Criminal Jury in the United States, <span class="citation no-link">61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 867</span>, 912-913 (1994). Justice Chase’s defense to one of the charges in his 1805 impeachment trial was that “he well knows, that it is the right of juries in criminal cases, to give a general verdict of acquittal, which cannot be set aside on account of its being contrary to law, and that hence results the power of juries, to decide on the law as well as on the facts, in all criminal cases. This power he holds to be a sacred part of our legal privileges . . . .” IS. Smith &amp; T. Lloyd, Trial of Samuel <span class="citation no-link">Chase 34</span> (1805).</p>
<p id="b559-5"><em><span class="citation" data-id="94082"><a href="/opinion/94082/sparf-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sparf v. United States">Sparf, supra,</a></span> </em>the case on which the Government relies, had nothing to do with the issue before us here. The question there was whether the jury could be deprived of the power to determine, not only historical facts, not only mixed questions of fact and law, <em>but pure questions of law </em>in a criminal case. As the foregoing quotation from Justice Chase suggests, many thought the jury had such power. See generally Alschuler &amp; Deiss, <em>supra, </em>at 902-916. We decided that it did not. In criminal cases, as in civil, we held, the judge must be permitted to instruct the jury on the law and to insist that the jury follow his instructions. <span class="citation" data-id="94082"><a href="/opinion/94082/sparf-v-united-states/#105" aria-description="Citation for case: Sparf v. United States">156 U. S., at 105-106</a></span>. But our decision in no way undermined the historical and constitutionally guaranteed right of criminal defendants to demand that the jury decide guilt or innocence on every issue, which includes application of the law to the facts. To the contrary, Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, explained the many judicial assertions of the jury’s <page-number citation-index="1" label="514">*514</page-number>right to determine both law and fact as expressions of “the principle, that when the question is <em>compounded of law and fact, </em>a general verdict, <em>ex necessitate, </em>disposes of the case in hand, both as to law and fact.” <span class="citation" data-id="94082"><a href="/opinion/94082/sparf-v-united-states/#90" aria-description="Citation for case: Sparf v. United States"><em>Id., </em>at 90</a></span> (emphasis in original). He gave as an example the 1807 treason trial of Aaron Burr in which Chief Justice Marshall charged the jury that “ ‘levying war is an act <em>compounded of law and fact; </em>of which the jury, aided by the court must judge. . . . [And] hav[ing] now heard the opinion of the court on the <em>law </em>of the case[,3 [t]hey <em>will apply that law to the facts, </em>and will find a verdict of guilty or not guilty as their own consciences may direct.’ ” <em><span class="citation" data-id="94082"><a href="/opinion/94082/sparf-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sparf v. United States">Id.,</a></span> </em>at 67 (quoting <span class="citation no-link">2 Burr’s Trial 548</span>, 550 (D. Robertson ed. 1875)) (emphasis in original). Other expressions of the same principle abound. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Battiste, </em><span class="citation" data-id="8638256"><a href="/opinion/8658405/united-states-v-battiste/#1043" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Battiste">24 F. Cas. 1042, 1043</a></span> (No. 14,545) (CC Mass. 1835) (Story, J., sitting as Circuit Justice) (the jury’s general verdict is “necessarily compounded of [both] law and fact”). As Thayer wrote at the end of the 19th century: “From the beginning ... it was perceived that any general verdict, such as . . . not guilty, involved a conclusion of law, and that the jury did, in a sense, in such cases answer a question of law.” Thayer, <em>supra, </em>at 253.</p>
<p id="b560-5">The more modern authorities the Government cites also do not support its concept of the criminal jury as mere fact-finder. Although each contains language discussing the jury’s role as factfinder, see <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112868"><a href="/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sullivan v.

S. 358, 364</a></span> (1970), each also confirms that the jury’s constitutional responsibility is not merely to determine the facts, but to apply the law to those facts and draw the ultimate conclusion of guilt or innocence. The point is put with unmistakable clarity in <em><span class="citation" data-id="110093"><a href="/opinion/110093/county-court-of-ulster-cty-v-allen/" aria-description="Citation for case: County Court of Ulster Cty. v.

<p id="b561-6">B</p>
<p id="b561-7">The Government next argues that, even if the jury is generally entitled to pass on all elements of a crime, there is a historical exception for materiality determinations in perjury prosecutions. We do not doubt that historical practice is relevant to what the Constitution means by such concepts as trial by jury, see <em>Murray’s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="87010"><a href="/opinion/87010/den-ex-dem-murray-v-hoboken-land-improvement-co/#276" aria-description="Citation for case: Den Ex Dem. Murray v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.">18 How. 272, 276-277</a></span> (1856); <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112358"><a href="/opinion/112358/holland-v-illinois/#481" aria-description="Citation for case: Holland v. Illinois">493 U. S. 474, 481</a></span> (1990), and it is precisely historical practice that we have relied on in concluding that the jury must find all the elements. The existence of a unique historical exception to this principle — and an exception that reduces the power of the jury precisely when it is most important, <em>i. e., </em>in a prosecution not for harming another individual, but for offending against the Government itself— would be so extraordinary that the evidence for it would have to be convincing indeed. It is not so.</p>
<p id="b561-8">The practice of having courts determine the materiality of false statements in perjury prosecutions is neither as old, nor as uniform, as the Government suggests. In England, no pre-Revolution cases appear to have addressed the question, <page-number citation-index="1" label="516">*516</page-number>and the judges reached differing results when the issue finally arose in the mid-19th century. Compare <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Lavey, </em>3 Car. &amp; K. 26, 30, 175 Eng. Rep. 448, 450 (Q. B. 1850) (materiality is a jury question), <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Goddard, 2 F. &amp; </em>F. 361, 175 Eng. Rep. 1096 (1861) (same), with <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Courtney, </em>5 Ir. C. L. 434, 439 (Ct. Crim. App. 1856) (dictum) (materiality is a question for the judge); <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Gibbon, </em>Le. &amp; Ca. 109, 113-114, 169 Eng. Rep. 1324, 1326 (1861) (same). It was not until 1911,120 years after the adoption of our Bill of Rights, that the rule the Government argues for was finally adopted in England — not by judicial decision but by Act of Parliament. See Perjury Act of 1911, § 1(6), 1 &amp; 2 Geo. V, ch. 6.</p>
<p id="b562-5">Much more importantly, there was also no clear practice of having the judge determine the materiality question in this country at or near the time the Bill of Rights was adopted. The Government cites <em>Power </em>v. <em>Price, </em><span class="citation" data-id="6119075"><a href="/opinion/6251836/power-v-price/" aria-description="Citation for case: Power v. Price">16 Wend. 450</a></span> (N. Y. 1836), as “[t]he earliest reported case on the question” whether “materiality in perjury prosecutions is a question for the court rather than the jury,” claiming that there “New York’s highest court held that a trial judge had correctly reserved the question of materiality to itself.” Brief for United States 18. <em><span class="citation" data-id="6119075"><a href="/opinion/6251836/power-v-price/" aria-description="Citation for case: Power v. Price">Power</a></span> </em>held nothing even close to this. <em><span class="citation" data-id="6119075"><a href="/opinion/6251836/power-v-price/" aria-description="Citation for case: Power v. Price">Power</a></span> </em>was not a perjury case; indeed, it was not even a criminal prosecution. It was a civil action in which Price sued Power for the slander of imputing to him the crime of perjury. The Court of Appeals held that Price did not need to prove the materiality of the alleged false statement in order to make out a prima facie case; but that Power could raise immateriality as an affirmative defense negating intent to impute perjury. <span class="citation" data-id="6119075"><a href="/opinion/6251836/power-v-price/#455" aria-description="Citation for case: Power v. Price">16 Wend., at 455-456</a></span>. It then said that the trial court “was clearly right in instructing the jury that the testimony given on the former trial was proved to be material,” since “it merely decided a question of law, arising upon the proof of facts as to which there was no dispute or contrariety of testimony.” <span class="citation" data-id="6119075"><a href="/opinion/6251836/power-v-price/#456" aria-description="Citation for case: Power v. Price"><em>Id., </em>at 456</a></span>. But the courts’ <page-number citation-index="1" label="517">*517</page-number>power to resolve mixed-law-and-fact questions in civil cases is not at issue here; civil and criminal juries’ required roles are obviously not identical, or else there could be no directed verdicts for civil plaintiffs. The other early case relied upon by the Government, <em>Steinman </em>v. <em>McWilliams, </em><span class="citation" data-id="6227699"><a href="/opinion/6358947/steinman-v-mcwilliams/#177" aria-description="Citation for case: Steinman v. McWilliams">6 Pa. 170, 177-178</a></span> (1847), another slander case, is inapt for the same reason. The earliest American case involving the point that we have been able to find places the Government itself in opposition to its position here. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cowing, </em><span class="citation" data-id="8315944"><a href="/opinion/8347336/united-states-v-cowing/#681" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Cowing">25 F. Cas. 680, 681</a></span> (No. 14,880) (CC DC 1835), the United States argued that materiality in a perjury prosecution was a matter for the jury’s consideration, citing an unpublished decision of the General Court of Virginia. The federal court, however, did not address the issue.</p>
<p id="b563-5">State and federal cases appear not to have addressed the question until the latter part of the 19th century, at which time they do not display anything like the “virtual unanimity” claimed by the Government. Brief for United States 18. Some of the opinions cited by the Government, asserting that materiality was a question of “law” for the judge, appear to have involved either demurrers to the indictment or appeals from convictions in which the case for materiality was so weak that no reasonable juror could credit it — so that even on our view of the matter the case should not have gone to the jury. (The prosecution’s failure to provide minimal evidence of materiality, like its failure to provide minimal evidence of any other element, of course raises a question of “law” that warrants dismissal.) See, <em>e. g., United States </em>v. <em>Shinn, </em><span class="citation" data-id="8123198"><a href="/opinion/8161537/united-states-v-shinn/#452" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b564-5">Even assuming, however, that all the Government’s last-half-of-the-19th-century cases fully stand for the proposition that the defendant has no right to jury determination of materiality, there are cases that support the other view.

At most there had developed a division of authority on the point, as the treatise writers of the period amply demonstrate. Bishop in 1872 took the position that “[p]ractically,... the whole subject is to be passed upon by the jury, under instructions from the judge, as involving, like most other cases, mixed questions of law and of fact.” 2 J. Bishop, Commentaries on Law of Criminal Procedure § 935, p. 508 (2d ed.). May’s 1881 treatise reported that “[w]hether materiality is a question of law for the court or of fact for a jury, is a point upon which the authorities are about equally divided.” J. May, Law of Crimes § 188, p. 205. Greenleaf, writing in 1883, sided with Bishop (“It seems that the materiality of the matter assigned is a question for the jury”), 3 S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence § 195, p. 189, n. (b) (14th ed.) — but two editions later, in 1899, said that the question was one for the judge, 3 S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence § 195, p. 196, n. 2 (16th ed.).</p>
<p id="b564-6">In sum, we find nothing like a consistent historical tradition supporting the proposition that the element of materiality in perjury prosecutions is to be decided by the judge. Since that proposition is contrary to the uniform general un<page-number citation-index="1" label="519">*519</page-number>derstanding (and we think the only understanding consistent with principle) that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments require conviction by a jury of <em>all </em>elements of the crime, we must reject those cases that have embraced it. Though uniform postratification practice can shed light upon the meaning of an ambiguous constitutional provision, the practice here is not uniform, and the core meaning of the constitutional guarantees is unambiguous.</p>

<p id="b565-6">The Government’s final argument is that the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>requires that we deny respondent’s constitutional claim, citing our decision in <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101414"><a href="/opinion/101414/sinclair-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sinclair v.

That case is not controlling in the strictest sense, since it involved the assertion of a Sixth Amendment right to have the jury determine, not “materiality” under § 1001, but rather “pertinency” under that provision of Title 2 making it criminal contempt of Congress to refuse to answer a “question pertinent to [a] question under [congressional] inquiry,” Rev. Stat. § 102, <span class="citation no-link">2 U. S. C. § 192</span>. The two questions are similar, however, and the essential argument made by respondent here was made by appellant in that case, who sought reversal of his conviction because of the trial court’s failure to submit the question of pertinency to the jury: “[I]t has been said over and over again, that every essential ingredient of the crime must be proven to the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.” Brief for Appellant in <em><span class="citation" data-id="101414"><a href="/opinion/101414/sinclair-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sinclair v.

It is commonplace for the same mixed question of law and fact to be assigned to the court for one purpose, and to the jury for another. The question of probable cause to conduct a search, for example, is resolved by the judge when it arises in the context of a motion to suppress evidence obtained in the search; but by the jury when it is one of the elements of the crime of depriving a person of constitutional rights under color of law, see <span class="citation no-link">18 U.
