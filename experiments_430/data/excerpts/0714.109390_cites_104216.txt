**Lead Opinion**
 In the present posture of the case the most basic question is whether the respective rights and liabilities of the parties are to be decided under the criteria of the National Labor Relations Act alone, under a First Amendment standard, or under some combination of the two.  It is to that question, accordingly, that we now turn.  *513 It is, of course, a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state.  See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Comm., 412 U. S. 94 .  Thus, while statutory or common law may in some situations extend protection or provide redress against a private corporation or person who seeks to abridge the free expression of others, no such protection or redress is provided by the Constitution itself.  This elementary proposition is little more than a truism.  But even truisms are not always unexceptionably true, and an exception to this one was recognized almost 30 years ago in Marsh v. Alabama, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 501</citedDecision> .  In <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , a Jehovah’s Witness who had distributed literature without a license on a sidewalk in Chickasaw, Ala., was convicted of criminal trespass.  Chickasaw was a so-called company town, wholly owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corp. It was described in the Court’s opinion as follows: “Except for [ownership by a private corporation] it has all the characteristics of any other American town.  The property consists of residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a ‘business block’ on which business places are situated.  A deputy of the Mobile County Sheriff, paid by the company, serves as the town’s policeman.  Merchants and service establishments have rented the stores and business places on the business block and the United States uses one of the places as a post office from which six carriers deliver mail to the people of Chickasaw and the adjacent area.  The town and the surrounding neighborhood, which can not be distinguished from the Gulf property by anyone not familiar with the property lines, are thickly *514 settled, and according to all indications the residents use the business block as their regular shopping center.  To do so, they now, as they have for many years, make use of a company-owned paved street and sidewalk located alongside the store fronts in order to enter and leave the stores and the post office.  Intersecting company-owned roads at each end of the business block lead into a four-lane public highway which runs parallel to the business block at a distance of thirty feet.  There is nothing to stop highway traffic from coming onto the business block and upon arrival a traveler may make free use of the facilities available there.  In short the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the property belongs to a private corporation.” Id,., at 502-503.  The Court pointed out that if the “title” to Chickasaw had “belonged not to a private but to a municipal corporation and had appellant been arrested for violating a municipal ordinance rather than a ruling by those appointed by the corporation to manage a company town it would have been clear that appellant’s conviction must be reversed.” <citedDecision>Id., at 504</citedDecision> .  Concluding that Gulfs “property interests” should not be allowed to lead to a different result in Chickasaw, which did “not function differently from any other town,” <citedDecision>id., at 506-508</citedDecision> , the Court invoked the First and Fourteenth Amendments to reverse the appellant’s conviction.  It was the <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> case that in 1968 provided the foundation for the Court’s decision in Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 .  That case involved peaceful picketing within a large *515 shopping center near Altoona, Pa. One of the tenants of the shopping center was a retail store that employed a wholly nonunion staff.  Members of a local union picketed the store, carrying signs proclaiming that it was nonunion and that its employees were not receiving union wages or other union benefits.  The picketing took place on the shopping center’s property in the immediate vicinity of the store.  A Pennsylvania court issued an injunction that required all picketing to be confined to public areas outside the shopping center, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the issuance of this injunction.  This Court held that the doctrine of the <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> case required reversal of that judgment.  The Court’s opinion pointed out that the First and Fourteenth Amendments would clearly have protected the picketing if it had taken place on a public sidewalk: “It is clear that if the shopping center premises were not privately owned but instead constituted the business area of a municipality, which they to a large extent resemble, petitioners could not be barred from exercising their First Amendment rights there on the sole ground that title to the property was in the municipality.  Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 (1938); Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496 (1939); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413 (1943).  The essence of those opinions is that streets, sidewalks, parks, and other similar public places are so historically associated with the exercise of First Amendment rights that access to them for the purpose of exercising such rights cannot constitutionally be denied broadly and absolutely.” 391 U. S., at 315 .  The Court’s opinion then reviewed the <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> case in detail, emphasized the similarities between the business *516 block in Chickasaw, Ala., and the Logan Valley shopping center, and unambiguously concluded: “The shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent of the business district of Chickasaw involved in Marsh.” 391 U. S., at 318 .  Upon the basis of that conclusion, the Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments required reversal of the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. There were three dissenting opinions in the Logan Valley case, one of them by the author of the Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , Mr. Justice Black. His disagreement with the Court’s reasoning was total: “In affirming petitioners’ contentions the majority opinion relies on <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Alabama, supra,</citedDecision> and holds that respondents’ property has been transformed to some type of public property.  But <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> was never intended to apply to this kind of situation.  <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> dealt with the very special situation of a company-owned town, complete with streets, alleys, sewers, stores, residences, and everything else that goes to make a town.  ... I can find very little resemblance between the shopping center involved in this case and Chickasaw, Alabama.  There are no homes, there is no sewage disposal plant, there is not even a post office on this private property which the Court now considers the equivalent of a ‘town.’ ” 391 U. S., at 330-331 (footnote omitted).  “The question is, Under what circumstances can private property be treated as though it were public?  The answer that <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> gives is when that property has taken on all the attributes of a town, i.  e., ‘residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a “business block” on which business places are situated.’ <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 502</citedDecision> .  I *517 can find nothing in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> which indicates that if one of these features is present, e. g., a business district, this is sufficient for the Court to confiscate a part of an owner’s private property and give its use to people who want to picket on it.” Id., at 332.  “To hold that store owners are compelled by law to supply picketing areas for pickets to drive store customers away is to create a court-made law wholly disregarding the constitutional basis on which private ownership of property rests in this country.  .  .  .” Id., at 332-333.  Four years later the Court had occasion to reconsider the Logan Valley doctrine in Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 .  That case involved a shopping center covering some 50 acres in downtown Portland, Ore. On a November day in 1968 five young people entered the mall of the shopping center and distributed handbills protesting the then ongoing American military operations in Vietnam.  Security guards told them to leave, and they did so, “to avoid arrest.” Id., at 556 .  They subsequently brought suit in a Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The trial court ruled’ in their favor, holding that the distribution of handbills on the shopping center’s property was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment, 446 F. 2d 545 , expressly relying on this Court’s <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> and Logan Valley decisions.  This Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The Court in its Lloyd opinion did not say that it was overruling the Logan Valley decision.  Indeed, a substantial portion of the Court’s opinion in Lloyd was devoted to pointing out the differences between the two cases, noting particularly that, in contrast to the hand-billing in Lloyd, the picketing in Logan Valley had been *518 specifically directed to a store in the shopping center and the pickets had had no other reasonable opportunity to reach their intended audience.  407 U. S., at 561-567.  5 But the fact is that the reasoning of the Court’s opinion in Lloyd cannot be squared with the reasoning of the Court’s opinion in Logan Valley.  It matters not that some Members of the Court may continue to believe that the Logan Valley case was rightly decided.

 .  that the property of a large shopping center is ‘open to the public,’ serves the same purposes as a ‘business district’ of a municipality, and therefore has been dedicated to certain types of public use.  The argument is that such a center has sidewalks, streets, and parking areas which are functionally similar to facilities customarily provided by municipalities.  It is then asserted that all members of the public, whether invited as customers or not, have the same right of free speech as they would have on the similar public facilities in the streets of a city or town.  “The argument reaches too far.  The Constitution by no means requires such an attenuated doctrine of dedication of private property to public use.  The closest decision in theory, <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Alabama, supra,</citedDecision> involved the assumption by a private enterprise of all of the attributes of a state-created municipality and the exercise by that enterprise of semiofficial municipal functions as a delegate of the State.  In effect, thé owner of the company town was performing the full spectrum of municipal powers and stood in the shoes of the State.  In the instant case there is no comparable assumption or exercise of municipal functions or power.” <citedDecision>Id., at 568-569</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  *520 “We hold that there has been no such dedication of Lloyd’s privately owned and operated shopping center to public use as to entitle respondents to exercise therein the asserted First Amendment rights.  .  .  <citedDecision>Id., at 570</citedDecision> .  If a large self-contained shopping center is the functional equivalent of a municipality, as Logan Valley held, then the First and Fourteenth Amendments would not permit control of speech within such a center to depend upon the speech’s content.  8 For while a municipality may constitutionally impose reasonable time, place, and manner regulations on the use of its streets and sidewalks for First Amendment purposes, see Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 ; Poulos v. New Hampshire, 345 U. S. 395 , and may even forbid altogether such use of some of its facilities, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U. S. 39 ; what a municipality may not do under the First and Fourteenth Amendments is to discriminate in the regulation of expression on the basis of the content of that expression, Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205 .  “[A]bove all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 .  9 It conversely follows, therefore, that if the respondents in the Lloyd case did not have a First Amendment right to enter that shopping center to distribute handbills concerning Vietnam, then the pickets in the present case did not have a First Amendment *521 right to enter this shopping center for the purpose of advertising their strike against the Butler Shoe Co. We conclude, in short, that under the present state of the law the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no part to play in a case such as this.  Ill From what has been said it follows that the rights and liabilities of the parties in this case are dependent exclusively upon the National Labor Relations Act.  Under the Act the task of the Board, subject to review by the courts, is to resolve conflicts between § 7 rights and private property rights, “and to seek a proper accommodation between the two.” Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S., at 543.

 S. C. §§ 152 (6) and (7).  The Board has held that a statutory “employer” may violate § 8 (a) (1) with respect to employees other than his own.  See Austin Co., 101 N. L. R. B. 1257, 1258-1259.  See also § 2 (13) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. §152 (13).  Hudgens v. Local 315, Retail, Wholesale & Dept. Store Union, 205 N. L. R. B. 628.  Insofar as the two shopping centers differed as such, the one in Lloyd more closely resembled the business section in Chickasaw, Ala.: “The principal differences between the two centers are that the Lloyd Center is larger than Logan Valley, that Lloyd Center contains more commercial facilities, that Lloyd Center contains a range of professional and nonprofessional services that were not found in Logan Valley, and that Lloyd Center is much more intertwined with public streets than Logan Valley.  Also, as in <citedDecision>Marsh, supra,</citedDecision> Lloyd’s private police are given full police power by the city of Portland, even though they are hired, fired, controlled, and paid by the owners of the Center.  This was not true in Logan Valley.” 407 U. S., at 575 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  See id., at 570 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  This was the entire thrust of Mr. Justice Marshall’s dissenting opinion in the Lloyd case. See id., at 584.  Mr. Justice White clearly recognized this principle in his Logan Valley dissenting opinion.  391 U. S., at 339 .  The Court has in the past held that some expression is not protected “speech” within the meaning of the First Amendment.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Powell, with whom The Chief Justice joins, concurring.  Although I agree with Mr. Justice White’s view concurring in the result that Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 (1972), did not overrule Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 (1968), and that the present case can be distinguished narrowly from Logan Valley, I nevertheless have joined the opinion of the Court today.  The law in this area, particularly with respect to whether First Amendment or labor law principles are applicable, has been less than clear since Logan Valley analogized a shopping center to the “company town” in Marsh v. Alabama, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 501</citedDecision> (1946).  Mr. Justice Black, the author of the Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , thought the decisions were irreconcilable.  1 I now agree *524 with Mr. Justice Black that the opinions in these cases cannot be harmonized in a principled way.  Upon more mature thought, I have concluded that we would have been wiser in Lloyd Corp. to have confronted this disharmony rather than draw distinctions based upon rather attenuated factual differences.  2 The Court’s opinion today clarifies the confusion engendered by these cases by accepting Mr. Justice Black’s reading of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> and by recognizing more sharply the distinction between the First Amendment and labor law issues that may arise in cases of this kind.  It seems to me that this clarification of the law is desirable.  In his dissent in Logan Valley, Mr. Justice Black stated that “Marsh was never intended to apply to this kind of situation.  .  .  .  [T]he basis on which the <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> decision rested was that the property involved encompassed an area that for all practical purposes had been turned into a town; the area had all the attributes of a town *524 and was exactly like any other town in Alabama.  I can find very little resemblance between the shopping center involved in this case and Chickasaw, Alabama.” 391 U. S., at 330, 331 .  The editorial “we” above is directed primarily to myself as the author of the Court’s opinion in Lloyd Corp.

 .  directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put.” Id., at 320 n. 9.  Lloyd involved the distribution of antiwar handbills in a large shopping center, and while some of us viewed *536 the case differently, 407 U. S., at 570, 577-579 (Marshall, J., dissenting), the Court treated it as presenting the question left open in Logan Valley.  But the Court did no more than decide that question.  It preserved the holding of Logan Valley, as limited to cases in which (1) the picketing is directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property is put, and (2) “no other reasonable opportunities for the pickets to convey their message to their intended audience [are] available.” 407 U. S., at 563.  The Court today gives short shrift to the language in Lloyd preserving Logan Valley, and quotes extensively from language that admittedly differs in emphasis from much of the language of Logan Valley.  But even the language quoted by the Court says no more than that the dedication of the Lloyd Center to public use was more limited than the dedication of the company town in Marsh v. Alabama, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 501</citedDecision> (1946), and that the pickets in Lloyd were not entitled to exercise.  “the asserted First Amendment rights” — that is, the right to distribute antiwar handbills.  Any doubt about the limited scope of Lloyd is removed completely by a consideration of Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 (1972), decided the same day as Lloyd.  In Central Hardware the Court was faced with solicitation by nonemployee union organizers on a parking lot of a retail store that was not part of a shopping center complex — activity clearly related to the use to which the private property had been put.  The Court found the activity unprotected by the First Amendment, but in a way that explicitly preserved the holding in Logan Valley.  The Court could have held that the First Amendment has no application to use-related activity on privately owned business property, thereby rejecting Logan Valley, but instead the Court chose to *537 distinguish the parking lot in Central Hardware from the shopping center complex in Logan Valley.  Rejecting the argument that the opening of property to the general public suffices to activate the prohibition of the First Amendment, the Court explained: “This analysis misconceives the rationale of Logan Valley.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 I continue to believe that the First Amendment principles underlying Logan Valley are sound, and were unduly limited in Lloyd.  But accepting Lloyd, I am not convinced that Logan Valley must be overruled.  The foundation of Logan Valley consisted of this Court’s decisions recognizing a right of access to streets, sidewalks, parks, and other public places historically associated with the exercise of First Amendment rights.  E. g., Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496, 515-516 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 308 (1940); Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569, 574 (1941); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413 (1943); Saia v. New York, 334 U. S. 558 (1948).  Thus, the Court in Logan Valley observed that access to such forums “cannot constitutionally be denied broadly and absolutely.” 391 U. S., at 315 .  The importance of access to such places for speech-related purposes is clear, for they are often the only places for effective speech and assembly.  <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Alabama, supra,</citedDecision> which the Court purports to leave untouched, made clear that in applying those cases granting a right of access to streets, sidewalks, and other public places, courts ought not let the formalities of title put an end to analysis.  The Court in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> observed that “the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the *539 property belongs to a private corporation.” <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 503</citedDecision> .  That distinction was not determinative: “Ownership does not always mean absolute dominion.  The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.” <citedDecision>Id., at 506</citedDecision> .  Regardless of who owned or possessed the town in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , the Court noted, “the public .  .  .  has an identical interest in the functioning of the community in such manner that the channels of communication remain free,” <citedDecision>id., at 507</citedDecision> , and that interest was held to prevail.  The Court adopts the view that <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> has no bearing on this case because the privately owned property in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> involved all the characteristics of a typical town.  But there is nothing in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> to suggest that its general approach was limited to the particular facts of that case. The underlying concern in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> was that traditional public channels of communication remain free, regardless of the incidence of ownership.  Given that concern, the crucial fact in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> was that the company owned the traditional forums essential for effective communication; it was immaterial that the company also owned a sewer system and that its property in other respects resembled a town.  In Logan Valley we recognized what the Court today refuses to recognize — that the owner of the modern shopping center complex, by dedicating his property to public use as a business district, to some extent displaces ■the “State” from control of historical First Amendment forums, and may acquire a virtual monopoly of places suitable for effective communication.  The roadways, parking lots, and walkways of the modern shopping cen *540 ter may be as essential for effective speech as the streets and sidewalks in the municipal or company-owned town.  7 I simply cannot reconcile the Court’s denial of any role for the First Amendment in the shopping center with Marsh’s recognition of a full role for the First Amendment on the streets and sidewalks of the company-owned town.  My reading of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> admittedly carried me farther than the Court in Lloyd, but the Lloyd Court remained responsive in its own way to the concerns underlying Marsh. Lloyd retained the availability of First Amendment protection when the picketing is related to the function of the shopping center, and when there is no other reasonable opportunity to convey the message to the intended audience.  Preserving Logan Valley subject to Lloyd’s two related criteria guaranteed that the First Amendment would have application in those situations in which the shopping center owner had most clearly monopolized the forums essential for effective communication.  This result, although not the optimal one in my view, Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S., at 579-583 (Marshall, J., dissenting), is nonetheless defensible.  In <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , the private entity had displaced the “state” from control of all the places to which the public had historically enjoyed access for First Amendment purposes, and the First Amendment was accordingly held fully applicable to the private entity’s conduct.  The shopping center owner, on the other hand, controls only *541 a portion of such places, leaving other traditional public forums available to the citizen.  But the shopping center owner may nevertheless control all places essential for the effective undertaking of some speech-related activities — namely, those related to the activities of the shopping center.  As for those activities, then, the First Amendment ought to have application under the reasoning of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , and that was precisely the state of the law after Lloyd.  The Court’s only apparent objection to this analysis is that it makes the applicability of the First Amendment turn to some degree on the subject matter of the speech.  But that in itself is no objection, and the cases cited by the Court to the effect that government may not “restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content,” Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972), are simply inapposite.  In those cases, it was clearly the government that was acting, and the First Amendment’s bar against infringing speech was unquestionably applicable; the Court simply held that the government, faced with a general command to permit speech, cannot choose to forbid some speech because of its message.  The shopping center cases are quite different; in these cases the primary regulator is a private entity whose property has “assume[d] to some significant degree the functional attributes of public property devoted to public use.” Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S., at 547.  The very question in these cases is whether, and under what circumstances, the First Amendment has any application at all. The answer to that question, under the •view of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> described above, depends to some extent on the subject of the speech the private entity seeks to regulate, because the degree to which the private entity monopolizes the effective channels of communication *542 may depend upon what subject is involved.  8 This limited reference to the subject matter of the speech poses none of the dangers of government suppression or censorship that lay at the heart of the cases cited by the Court. See, e. g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, supra, at 95-96 .  It is indeed ironic that those cases, whose obvious concern was the promotion of free speech, are cited today to require its surrender.  In the final analysis, the Court's rejection of any role for the First Amendment in the privately owned shopping center complex stems, I believe, from an overly formalistic view of the relationship between the institution of private ownership of property and the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech.  No one would seriously question the legitimacy of the values of privacy and individual autonomy traditionally associated with privately owned property.  But property that is privately owned is not always held for private use, and when a property owner opens his property to public use the force of those values diminishes.  A degree of privacy is necessarily surrendered; thus, the privacy interest that petitioner retains when he leases space to 60 retail businesses and invites the public onto his land for the transaction of business with other members of the public is small indeed.
**Combined Opinion**
 In the present posture of the case the most basic question is whether the respective rights and liabilities of the parties are to be decided under the criteria of the National Labor Relations Act alone, under a First Amendment standard, or under some combination of the two.  It is to that question, accordingly, that we now turn.  *513 It is, of course, a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state.  See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Comm., 412 U. S. 94 .  Thus, while statutory or common law may in some situations extend protection or provide redress against a private corporation or person who seeks to abridge the free expression of others, no such protection or redress is provided by the Constitution itself.  This elementary proposition is little more than a truism.  But even truisms are not always unexceptionably true, and an exception to this one was recognized almost 30 years ago in Marsh v. Alabama, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 501</citedDecision> .  In <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , a Jehovah's Witness who had distributed literature without a license on a sidewalk in Chickasaw, Ala., was convicted of criminal trespass.  Chickasaw was a so-called company town, wholly owned by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corp. It was described in the Court's opinion as follows: "Except for [ownership by a private corporation] it has all the characteristics of any other American town.  The property consists of residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a `business block' on which business places are situated.  A deputy of the Mobile County Sheriff, paid by the company, serves as the town's policeman.  Merchants and service establishments have rented the stores and business places on the business block and the United States uses one of the places as a post office from which six carriers deliver mail to the people of Chickasaw and the adjacent area.  The town and the surrounding neighborhood, which can not be distinguished from the Gulf property by anyone not familiar with the property lines, are thickly *514 settled, and according to all indications the residents use the business block as their regular shopping center.  To do so, they now, as they have for many years, make use of a company-owned paved street and sidewalk located alongside the store fronts in order to enter and leave the stores and the post office.  Intersecting company-owned roads at each end of the business block lead into a four-lane public highway which runs parallel to the business block at a distance of thirty feet.  There is nothing to stop highway traffic from coming onto the business block and upon arrival a traveler may make free use of the facilities available there.  In short the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the property belongs to a private corporation." <citedDecision>Id., at 502-503</citedDecision> .  The Court pointed out that if the "title" to Chickasaw had "belonged not to a private but to a municipal corporation and had appellant been arrested for violating a municipal ordinance rather than a ruling by those appointed by the corporation to manage a company town it would have been clear that appellant's conviction must be reversed." <citedDecision>Id., at 504</citedDecision> .  Concluding that Gulf's "property interests" should not be allowed to lead to a different result in Chickasaw, which did "not function differently from any other town," <citedDecision>id., at 506-508</citedDecision> , the Court invoked the First and Fourteenth Amendments to reverse the appellant's conviction.  It was the <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> case that in 1968 provided the foundation for the Court's decision in Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 .  That case involved peaceful picketing within a large *515 shopping center near Altoona, Pa. One of the tenants of the shopping center was a retail store that employed a wholly nonunion staff.  Members of a local union picketed the store, carrying signs proclaiming that it was nonunion and that its employees were not receiving union wages or other union benefits.  The picketing took place on the shopping center's property in the immediate vicinity of the store.  A Pennsylvania court issued an injunction that required all picketing to be confined to public areas outside the shopping center, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the issuance of this injunction.  This Court held that the doctrine of the <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> case required reversal of that judgment.  The Court's opinion pointed out that the First and Fourteenth Amendments would clearly have protected the picketing if it had taken place on a public sidewalk: "It is clear that if the shopping center premises were not privately owned but instead constituted the business area of a municipality, which they to a large extent resemble, petitioners could not be barred from exercising their First Amendment rights there on the sole ground that title to the property was in the municipality.  Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 (1938); Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496 (1939); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413 (1943).  The essence of those opinions is that streets, sidewalks, parks, and other similar public places are so historically associated with the exercise of First Amendment rights that access to them for the purpose of exercising such rights cannot constitutionally be denied broadly and absolutely." 391 U. S., at 315 .  The Court's opinion then reviewed the <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> case in detail, emphasized the similarities between the business *516 block in Chickasaw, Ala., and the Logan Valley shopping center, and unambiguously concluded: "The shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent of the business district of Chickasaw involved in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> .  " 391 U. S., at 318 .  Upon the basis of that conclusion, the Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments required reversal of the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. There were three dissenting opinions in the Logan Valley case, one of them by the author of the Court's opinion in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , Mr. Justice Black. His disagreement with the Court's reasoning was total: "In affirming petitioners' contentions the majority opinion relies on <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Alabama, supra</citedDecision> , and holds that respondents' property has been transformed to some type of public property.  But <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> was never intended to apply to this kind of situation.  <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> dealt with the very special situation of a company-owned town, complete with streets, alleys, sewers, stores, residences, and everything else that goes to make a town.  .  .  .  I can find very little resemblance between the shopping center involved in this case and Chickasaw, Alabama.  There are no homes, there is no sewage disposal plant, there is not even a post office on this private property which the Court now considers the equivalent of a `town.' " 391 U. S., at 330-331 (footnote omitted).  "The question is, Under what circumstances can private property be treated as though it were public?  The answer that <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> gives is when that property has taken on all the attributes of a town, i.  e., `residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a "business block" on which business places are situated.' <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 502</citedDecision> .  I *517 can find nothing in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> which indicates that if one of these features is present, e. g., a business district, this is sufficient for the Court to confiscate a part of an owner's private property and give its use to people who want to picket on it." Id., at 332.  "To hold that store owners are compelled by law to supply picketing areas for pickets to drive store customers away is to create a court-made law wholly disregarding the constitutional basis on which private ownership of property rests in this country.  .  .  ." Id., at 332-333.  Four years later the Court had occasion to reconsider the Logan Valley doctrine in Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 .  That case involved a shopping center covering some 50 acres in downtown Portland, Ore. On a November day in 1968 five young people entered the mall of the shopping center and distributed handbills protesting the then ongoing American military operations in Vietnam.  Security guards told them to leave, and they did so, "to avoid arrest." Id., at 556 .  They subsequently brought suit in a Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The trial court ruled in their favor, holding that the distribution of handbills on the shopping center's property was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment, 446 F. 2d 545 , expressly relying on this Court's <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> and Logan Valley decisions.  This Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The Court in its Lloyd opinion did not say that it was overruling the Logan Valley decision.  Indeed, a substantial portion of the Court's opinion in Lloyd was devoted to pointing out the differences between the two cases, noting particularly that, in contrast to the hand-billing in Lloyd, the picketing in Logan Valley had been *518 specifically directed to a store in the shopping center and the pickets had had no other reasonable opportunity to reach their intended audience.  407 U. S., at 561-567.  [5] But the fact is that the reasoning of the Court's opinion in Lloyd cannot be squared with the reasoning of the Court's opinion in Logan Valley .  It matters not that some Members of the Court may continue to believe that the Logan Valley case was rightly decided.
**Combined Opinion**
 .  that the property of a large shopping center is `open to the public,' serves the same purposes as a `business district' of a municipality, and therefore has been dedicated to certain types of public use.  The argument is that such a center has sidewalks, streets, and parking areas which are functionally similar to facilities customarily provided by municipalities.  It is then asserted that all members of the public, whether invited as customers or not, have the same right of free speech as they would have on the similar public facilities in the streets of a city or town.  "The argument reaches too far.  The Constitution by no means requires such an attenuated doctrine of dedication of private property to public use.  The closest decision in theory, <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Alabama, supra</citedDecision> , involved the assumption by a private enterprise of all of the attributes of a state-created municipality and the exercise by that enterprise of semi-official municipal functions as a delegate of the State.  In effect, the owner of the company town was performing the full spectrum of municipal powers and stood in the shoes of the State.  In the instant case there is no comparable assumption or exercise of municipal functions or power." <citedDecision>Id., at 568-569</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  *520 "We hold that there has been no such dedication of Lloyd's privately owned and operated shopping center to public use as to entitle respondents to exercise therein the asserted First Amendment rights.  .  .  ." <citedDecision>Id., at 570</citedDecision> .  If a large self-contained shopping center is the functional equivalent of a municipality, as Logan Valley held, then the First and Fourteenth Amendments would not permit control of speech within such a center to depend upon the speech's content.  [8] For while a municipality may constitutionally impose reasonable time, place, and manner regulations on the use of its streets and sidewalks for First Amendment purposes, see Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 ; Poulos v. New Hampshire, 345 U. S. 395 , and may even forbid altogether such use of some of its facilities, see Adderley v. Florida, 385 U. S. 39 ; what a municipality may not do under the First and Fourteenth Amendments is to discriminate in the regulation of expression on the basis of the content of that expression, Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205 .  "[A]bove all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content." Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 .  [9] It conversely follows, therefore, that if the respondents in the Lloyd case did not have a First Amendment right to enter that shopping center to distribute handbills concerning Vietnam, then the pickets in the present case did not have a First Amendment *521 right to enter this shopping center for the purpose of advertising their strike against the Butler Shoe Co. We conclude, in short, that under the present state of the law the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no part to play in a case such as this.  III From what has been said it follows that the rights and liabilities of the parties in this case are dependent exclusively upon the National Labor Relations Act.
**Combined Opinion**
 "The responsibility to adapt the Act to changing patterns of industrial life is entrusted to the Board." NLRB v. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U. S. 251, 266 .  For the reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals with directions to remand to the National Labor Relations Board, so that the case may be there considered under the statutory criteria of the National Labor Relations Act alone.  It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.  Although I agree with MR. JUSTICE WHITE'S view concurring in the result that Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 (1972), did not overrule Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 (1968), and that the present case can be distinguished narrowly from Logan Valley, I nevertheless have joined the opinion of the Court today.  The law in this area, particularly with respect to whether First Amendment or labor law principles are applicable, has been less than clear since Logan Valley analogized a shopping center to the "company town" in Marsh v. Alabama, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 501</citedDecision> (1946).  Mr. Justice Black, the author of the Court's opinion in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , thought the decisions were irreconcilable.  [1] I now agree *524 with Mr. Justice Black that the opinions in these cases cannot be harmonized in a principled way.  Upon more mature thought, I have concluded that we would have been wiser in Lloyd Corp. to have confronted this disharmony rather than draw distinctions based upon rather attenuated factual differences.  [2] The Court's opinion today clarifies the confusion engendered by these cases by accepting Mr. Justice Black's reading of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> and by recognizing more sharply the distinction between the First Amendment and labor law issues that may arise in cases of this kind.  It seems to me that this clarification of the law is desirable.  MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the result.  While I concur in the result reached by the Court, I find it unnecessary to inter Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 (1968), and therefore do not join the Court's opinion.  I agree that "the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no part to play in a case such as this," ante, at 521; but Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 (1972), did not overrule Logan Valley, either expressly or implicitly, and I would not, somewhat after the fact, say that it did.  One need go no further than Logan Valley itself, for the First Amendment protection established by Logan Valley was expressly limited to the picketing of a specific store for the purpose of conveying information with respect to the operation in the shopping center of that store: "The picketing carried on by petitioners was *525 directed specifically at patrons of the Weis Market located within the shopping center and the message sought to be conveyed to the public concerned the manner in which that particular market was being operated.  We are, therefore, not called upon to consider whether respondents' property rights could, consistently with the First Amendment, justify a bar on picketing which was not thus directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put."
**Combined Opinion**
Ante, at 518.  To be sure, some Members of the Court, myself included, believed that Logan Valley called for a different result in Lloyd and alluded in dissent to the possibility that "it is Logan Valley itself that the Court finds bothersome." 407 U. S., at 570, 584 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  But the fact remains that Logan Valley explicitly reserved the question later decided in Lloyd, and Lloyd carefully preserved the holding of Logan Valley.  And upon reflection, I am of the view that the two decisions are reconcilable.  A In Logan Valley the Court was faced with union picketing against a nonunion supermarket located in a large shopping center.  Our holding was a limited one: "All we decide here is that because the shopping center serves as the community business block `and is freely accessible and open to the people in the area and those passing through,' <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> v. Alabama, <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 508</citedDecision> , the State may not delegate the power, through the use of its trespass laws, wholly to exclude those members of the public wishing to exercise their First Amendment rights on the premises in a manner and for a purpose generally consonant with the use to which the property is actually put." 391 U. S., at 319-320 (footnote omitted).  We carefully noted that we were "not called upon to consider whether respondents' property rights could, consistently with the First Amendment, justify a bar on picketing which was not .  .  .  directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put." Id., at 320 n. 9.  Lloyd involved the distribution of antiwar handbills in a large shopping center, and while some of us viewed *536 the case differently, 407 U. S., at 570, 577-579 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), the Court treated it as presenting the question left open in Logan Valley.  But the Court did no more than decide that question.  It preserved the holding of Logan Valley, as limited to cases in which (1) the picketing is directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property is put, and (2) "no other reasonable opportunities for the pickets to convey their message to their intended audience [are] available." 407 U. S., at 563.  The Court today gives short shrift to the language in Lloyd preserving Logan Valley, and quotes extensively from language that admittedly differs in emphasis from much of the language of Logan Valley.  But even the language quoted by the Court says no more than that the dedication of the Lloyd Center to public use was more limited than the dedication of the company town in Marsh v. Alabama, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 501</citedDecision> (1946), and that the pickets in Lloyd were not entitled to exercise "the asserted First Amendment rights"that is, the right to distribute antiwar handbills.  Any doubt about the limited scope of Lloyd is removed completely by a consideration of Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 (1972), decided the same day as Lloyd.  In Central Hardware the Court was faced with solicitation by nonemployee union organizers on a parking lot of a retail store that was not part of a shopping center complexactivity clearly related to the use to which the private property had been put.  The Court found the activity unprotected by the First Amendment, but in a way that explicitly preserved the holding in Logan Valley.  The Court could have held that the First Amendment has no application to use-related activity on privately owned business property, thereby rejecting Logan Valley, but instead the Court chose to *537 distinguish the parking lot in Central Hardware from the shopping center complex in Logan Valley.  Rejecting the argument that the opening of property to the general public suffices to activate the prohibition of the First Amendment, the Court explained: "This analysis misconceives the rationale of Logan Valley.  Logan Valley involved a large commercial shopping center which the Court found had displaced, in certain relevant respects, the functions of the normal municipal `business block.'
**Combined Opinion**
 "Before an owner of private property can be subjected to the commands of the First and Fourteenth Amendments the privately owned property must assume to some significant degree the functional attributes of public property devoted to public use.  .  .  .  The only fact relied upon for the argument that Central's parking lots have acquired the characteristics of a public municipal facility is that they are `open to the public.' Such an argument could be made with respect to almost every retail and service establishment in the country, regardless of size or location.  To accept it would cut Logan Valley entirely away from its roots in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> .  " 407 U. S., at 547 (footnote omitted).  If, as the Court tells us, "the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive the Court's decision in the Lloyd case," ante, at 518, one wonders why the Court in Central Hardware, decided the same day as Lloyd, implicitly reaffirmed Logan Valley's rationale.  *538 B It is inescapable that after Lloyd, Logan Valley remained "good law," binding on the state and federal courts.  Our institutional duty in this case, if we consider the constitutional question at all, is to examine whether Lloyd and Logan Valley can continue to stand side by side, and, if they cannot, to decide which one must fall.  I continue to believe that the First Amendment principles underlying Logan Valley are sound, and were unduly limited in Lloyd.  But accepting Lloyd, I am not convinced that Logan Valley must be overruled.  The foundation of Logan Valley consisted of this Court's decisions recognizing a right of access to streets, sidewalks, parks, and other public places historically associated with the exercise of First Amendment rights.  E. g., Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496, 515-516 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 308 (1940); Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569, 574 (1941); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413 (1943); Saia v. New York, 334 U. S. 558 (1948).  Thus, the Court in Logan Valley observed that access to such forums "cannot constitutionally be denied broadly and absolutely." 391 U. S., at 315 .  The importance of access to such places for speech-related purposes is clear, for they are often the only places for effective speech and assembly.  Marsh v. <citedDecision>Alabama, supra</citedDecision> , which the Court purports to leave untouched, made clear that in applying those cases granting a right of access to streets, sidewalks, and other public places, courts ought not let the formalities of title put an end to analysis.  The Court in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> observed that "the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the *539 property belongs to a private corporation." <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 503</citedDecision> .  That distinction was not determinative: "Ownership does not always mean absolute dominion.  The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it." <citedDecision>Id., at 506</citedDecision> .  Regardless of who owned or possessed the town in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , the Court noted, "the public .  .  .  has an identical interest in the functioning of the community in such manner that the channels of communication remain free," <citedDecision>id., at 507</citedDecision> , and that interest was held to prevail.  The Court adopts the view that <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> has no bearing on this case because the privately owned property in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> involved all the characteristics of a typical town.  But there is nothing in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> to suggest that its general approach was limited to the particular facts of that case. The underlying concern in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> was that traditional public channels of communication remain free, regardless of the incidence of ownership.  Given that concern, the crucial fact in <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> was that the company owned the traditional forums essential for effective communication; it was immaterial that the company also owned a sewer system and that its property in other respects resembled a town.  In Logan Valley we recognized what the Court today refuses to recognizethat the owner of the modern shopping center complex, by dedicating his property to public use as a business district, to some extent displaces the "State" from control of historical First Amendment forums, and may acquire a virtual monopoly of places suitable for effective communication.  The roadways, parking lots, and walkways of the modern shopping center *540 may be as essential for effective speech as the streets and sidewalks in the municipal or company-owned town.  [7] I simply cannot reconcile the Court's denial of any role for the First Amendment in the shopping center with Marsh's recognition of a full role for the First Amendment on the streets and sidewalks of the company-owned town.  My reading of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> admittedly carried me farther than the Court in Lloyd, but the Lloyd Court remained responsive in its own way to the concerns underlying Marsh. Lloyd retained the availability of First Amendment protection when the picketing is related to the function of the shopping center, and when there is no other reasonable opportunity to convey the message to the intended audience.  Preserving Logan Valley subject to Lloyd's two related criteria guaranteed that the First Amendment would have application in those situations in which the shopping center owner had most clearly monopolized the forums essential for effective communication.  This result, although not the optimal one in my view, Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S., at 579-583 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), is nonetheless defensible.  In <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , the private entity had displaced the "state" from control of all the places to which the public had historically enjoyed access for First Amendment purposes, and the First Amendment was accordingly held fully applicable to the private entity's conduct.  The shopping center owner, on the other hand, controls only *541 a portion of such places, leaving other traditional public forums available to the citizen.  But the shopping center owner may nevertheless control all places essential for the effective undertaking of some speech-related activitiesnamely, those related to the activities of the shopping center.  As for those activities, then, the First Amendment ought to have application under the reasoning of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> , and that was precisely the state of the law after Lloyd.  The Court's only apparent objection to this analysis is that it makes the applicability of the First Amendment turn to some degree on the subject matter of the speech.  But that in itself is no objection, and the cases cited by the Court to the effect that government may not "restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content," Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972), are simply inapposite.  In those cases, it was clearly the government that was acting, and the First Amendment's bar against infringing speech was unquestionably applicable; the Court simply held that the government, faced with a general command to permit speech, cannot choose to forbid some speech because of its message.  The shopping center cases are quite different; in these cases the primary regulator is a private entity whose property has "assume[d] to some significant degree the functional attributes of public property devoted to public use." Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S., at 547.  The very question in these cases is whether, and under what circumstances, the First Amendment has any application at all. The answer to that question, under the view of <citedDecision>Marsh</citedDecision> described above, depends to some extent on the subject of the speech the private entity seeks to regulate, because the degree to which the private entity monopolizes the effective channels of communication *542 may depend upon what subject is involved.  [8] This limited reference to the subject matter of the speech poses none of the dangers of government suppression or censorship that lay at the heart of the cases cited by the Court. See, e. g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, supra, at 95-96 .  It is indeed ironic that those cases, whose obvious concern was the promotion of free speech, are cited today to require its surrender.  In the final analysis, the Court's rejection of any role for the First Amendment in the privately owned shopping center complex stems, I believe, from an overly formalistic view of the relationship between the institution of private ownership of property and the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech.  No one would seriously question the legitimacy of the values of privacy and individual autonomy traditionally associated with privately owned property.  But property that is privately owned is not always held for private use, and when a property owner opens his property to public use the force of those values diminishes.  A degree of privacy is necessarily surrendered; thus, the privacy interest that petitioner retains when he leases space to 60 retail business and invites the public onto his land for the transaction of business with other members of the public is small indeed.

 While Hudgens was not the employer of the employees involved in this case, it seems to be undisputed that he was an employer engaged in commerce within the meaning of §§ 2 (6) and (7) of the Act, 29 U.

[5]  Insofar as the two shopping centers differed as such, the one in Lloyd more closely resembled the business section in Chickasaw, Ala.: "The principal differences between the two centers are that the Lloyd Center is larger than Logan Valley, that Lloyd Center contains more commercial facilities, that Lloyd Center contains a range of professional and nonprofessional services that were not found in Logan Valley, and that Lloyd Center is much more intertwined with public streets than Logan Valley.  Also, as in <citedDecision>Marsh, supra,</citedDecision> Lloyd's private police are given full police power by the city of Portland, even though they are hired, fired, controlled, and paid by the owners of the Center.  This was not true in Logan Valley.  " 407 U. S., at 575 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  [6]  See id., at 570 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  [7]  This was the entire thrust of MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL'S dissenting opinion in the Lloyd case. See id., at 584.  [8]  MR. JUSTICE WHITE clearly recognized this principle in his Logan Valley dissenting opinion.  391 U. S., at 339 .
