Passage 1:
U.S. 1, 9, and their meaning would seem not to be doubtful if we can avoid reading into them that which they really do not contain.
In interpreting this language of the statute it will be of service to keep in mind three rules long established by this court, applicable to the patent law and to the construction of patents, viz:
1st. The scope of every patent is limited to the invention described in the claims contained in it, read in the light of the specification. These so mark where the progress claimed by the patent begins and where it ends that they have been aptly likened to the description in a deed, which sets the bounds to the grant which it contains. It is to the claims of every patent, therefore, that we must turn when we are seeking to determine what the invention is, the exclusive use of which is given to the inventor by the grant provided for by the statute, ย "He can claim nothing beyond them." Keystone Bridge Co. v. Phoenix Iron Co., 95 U.S. 274; Railroad Co. v. Mellon, <targetCase>104 U.S. 112</targetCase>, 118; Yale Lock Mfg. Co. v. Greenleaf, 117 U.S. 554, 559; McClain v. Ortmayer, 141 U.S. 419, 424.

It has long been settled that the patentee receives nothing from the law which he did not have before, and that the only effect of his patent is to restrain others from manufacturing, using or selling that which he has invented. The patent law simply protects him in the monopoly of that which he has invented and has described in the claims of his patent. United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 167 U.S. 224, 239; Paper Bag Patent Case, 210 U.S. 405, 424; Bauer v. O'Donnell, 229 U.S. 1, 10.
3rd. Since Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1, was decided in *511 1829 this court has consistently held that the primary purpose of our patent laws is not the creation of private fortunes for the owners of patents but is "to promote the progress of science and useful arts" (Constitution, Art. I, ยง 8), an object and purpose authoritatively expressed by Mr. Justice Story, in that decision, saying:
