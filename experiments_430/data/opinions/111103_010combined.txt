  On January 20, 1977, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms seized a cache of firearms from the home of Patrick Mulcahey. Mulcahey was subsequently indicted on charges that he had knowingly engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license, in violation of 18 U. S. C.
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="356">

  § 922(a)(1).

  At his criminal trial, Mulcahey admitted that he had no license to deal in firearms and that he had bought and sold firearms during the period set forth in the indictment. His defense was that he had been entrapped into making the illegal firearms transactions. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty.

  On the basis of his earlier acquittal, Mul-cahey asserted the defenses of res judicata and collateral es-toppel. The United States District Court for the District of South Carolina struck Mulcahey’s defenses, reasoning that an

The en banc majority relied upon two theories for its conclusion that the forfeiture proceeding against these firearms was barred by Mulcahey’s prior acquittal, although it did not sharply distinguish between the two. Because the majority considered the § 924(d) forfeiture proceeding to be criminal and punitive in nature, the Court of Appeals concluded that it was barred by double jeopardy principles. Looking to

  v.
  <em>
   United States, supra,
  </em>
  this Court held that a forfeiture action brought against certain distilling equipment was barred by the owner’s prior acquittal on charges of removing and concealing distilled spirits with the intent to defraud the revenue. The Court stated:
 </p>
<blockquote id="b428-4">
<span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="358"> 
   *358
   </span>
  “[W]here an issue raised as to the existence of the act or fact denounced has been tried in a criminal proceeding, instituted by the United States, and a judgment of acquittal has been rendered in favor of a particular person, that judgment is conclusive in favor of such person, on the subsequent trial of a suit
  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  by the United States, where, as against him, the existence of the same act or fact is the matter in issue, as a cause for the forfeiture of the property prosecuted in such suit
  <em>
   in rem.
  </em>
  It is urged as a reason for not allowing such effect to the judgment, that the acquittal in the criminal case may have taken place because of the rule requiring guilt to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and that, on the same evidence, on the question of preponderance of proof, there might be a verdict for the United States, in the suit
  <em>
   in rem.
  </em>
  Nevertheless, the fact or act has been put in issue and determined against the United States; and all that is imposed by the statute, as a consequence of guilt, is a punishment therefor. There could be no new trial of the criminal prosecution after the acquittal in it; and a subsequent trial of the civil suit amounts to substantially the same thing, with a difference only in the consequences following a judgment adverse to the claimant.”

  Turning to the taxpayer’s argument that double jeopardy barred the assessment of a monetary penalty following his acquittal on related criminal charges, the Court noted:
 </p>
<blockquote id="b429-7">
  “Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission; for the double jeopardy clause prohibits merely punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally, for the same offense. The question for decision is thus whether

 </blockquote>
<p id="b430-5">
  In concluding that the monetary penalty was merely a remedial civil sanction authorized by Congress to be assessed at the discretion of those administering the tax law, the Court observed that forfeiture of goods or their value and the payment of fixed or variable sums of money are sanctions that have long been recognized as enforceable by civil proceedings.

  Mulcahey first argues that, because of his earlier criminal acquittal, the doctrine of collateral estoppel operates to preclude the § 924(d) forfeiture action. But an acquittal on criminal charges does not prove that the defendant is innocent; it merely proves the existence of a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. We need not be concerned whether the jury decided to acquit Mulcahey because he was entrapped into making an illegal sale or whether the jurors were not convinced of
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="362"> 
   *362
   </span>
  his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for other reasons. In either case, the jury verdict in the criminal action did not negate the possibility that a preponderance of the evidence could show that Mulcahey was engaged in an unlicensed firearms business. Mulcahey’s acquittal on charges brought under § 922(a)(1) therefore does not estop the Government from proving in a civil proceeding that the firearms should be forfeited pursuant to § 924(d). It is clear that the difference in the relative burdens of proof in the criminal and civil actions precludes the application of the doctrine of collateral es-toppel.

  Mulcahey next contends that a forfeiture proceeding under § 924(d) is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Unless the forfeiture sanction was intended as punishment, so that the proceeding is essentially criminal in character, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not applicable.

  Applying the first prong of the Ward test to the facts of the instant case, we conclude that Congress designed forfeiture under § 924(d) as a remedial civil sanction. Congress’ intent in this regard is most clearly demonstrated by the procedural mechanisms it established for enforcing forfeitures under the statute. Section 924(d) does not prescribe the steps to be followed in effectuating a forfeiture, but rather incorporates by reference the procedures of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code), <span class="citation no-link">26 U. S. C. §§7321-7328</span>. The Code in turn provides that an action to enforce a forfeiture “shall be in the nature of a proceeding in rem in the United States District Court for the district where such seizure is made.” <span class="citation no-link">26 U. S. C. § 7323</span>. In contrast to the
  <em>
   in personam
  </em>
  nature of criminal actions, actions
  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  have traditionally been viewed as civil proceedings, with jurisdiction dependent upon seizure of a physical object. See

  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  nature of the action, the Code authorizes a summary administrative proceeding for forfeiture of items valued at $2,500 or less, for which notice of a seizure may be by publication. See <span class="citation no-link">26 U. S. C. § 7325</span>. By creating such distinctly civil procedures for forfeitures under § 924(d), Congress has “indicate[d] clearly that it intended a civil, not a criminal, sanction.”

  Moreover, § 924(d) is somewhat broader in scope than the criminal provisions of <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 922</span>. Section 924(d) subjects to forfeiture “[a]ny firearm or ammunition involved in or used
  <em>
   or intended to be used in,
  </em>
  any violation of the provisions of this chapter.” (Emphasis added.) But § 922(a)(1), the substantive criminal provision under which Mulcahey was prosecuted, does not render unlawful an
  <em>
   intention
  </em>
  to engage in the business of dealing in firearms without a license; only the completed act of engaging in the prohibited business is

  Whatever the actual scope of the conduct embraced by § 924(d), it is apparent from the differences in the language of these two statutes that the forfeiture provisions of § 924(d) were meant to be broader in scope than the criminal sanctions of § 922(a)(1).

  Finally, the forfeiture provision of § 924(d) furthers broad remedial aims. Section 924(d) was enacted as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, <span class="citation no-link">Pub. L. 90-351, 82</span> Stat. 233, and later retained without alteration in the Gun Control Act of 1968, <span class="citation no-link">Pub. L. 90-618, 82</span> Stat. 1224. In enacting the 1968 gun control legislation, Congress “was concerned with the widespread traffic in firearms and with their general availability to those whose possession thereof was contrary to the public interest.”

Accordingly, Congress sought to “control the indiscriminate flow” of firearms and to “assist and encourage States and local communities to adopt and enforce stricter gun control laws.” H. R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 8 (1968). Section 924(d) plays an important role in furthering the prophylactic purposes of the 1968 gun control legislation by discouraging unregulated commerce in firearms and by removing from circulation firearms that have been used or intended for use outside regulated channels of commerce. Keeping potentially dangerous weapons out of the hands of unlicensed dealers is a goal plainly more remedial than punitive. Accordingly, we hold that Congress viewed § 924(d) forfeiture as a remedial civil sanction rather than a criminal punishment.

  factors — whether or not the proscribed behavior is already a crime — lends any support to Mulcahey’s position that § 924(d) imposes a criminal penalty. The fact that actions giving rise to forfeiture proceedings under § 924(d) may also entail the criminal penalties of § 922(a)(1) admittedly suggests that § 924(d) is criminal in nature. But that indication is not as strong as it might seem at first blush.

  <em>
   supra,
  </em>
  at 363-364. Because the sanction embodied in § 924(d) is not limited to criminal misconduct, the forfeiture remedy cannot be said to be coextensive with the criminal penalty. What overlap there is between the two sanctions is not sufficient to persuade us that the forfeiture proceeding may not legitimately be viewed as civil in nature.

  factors in no way undermines Congress’ classification of the § 924(d) forfeiture action as a civil sanction. Mulcahey has failed to establish by the “clearest proof” that Congress has provided a sanction so punitive as to “transfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.”

We accordingly conclude that the forfeiture mechanism set forth in § 924(d) is not an additional penalty for the commission of a criminal act, but rather is a separate civil sanction, remedial in nature. Because the § 924(d) forfeiture proceeding brought against Mulcahey’s firearms is not a criminal proceeding, it is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.

   The number of firearms involved in this action has varied somewhat with time. Federal agents originally seized 105 firearms from Mulcahey, but later learned that 13 of them had been stolen. The stolen items were returned to their rightful owners, and the forfeiture action proceeded against the remaining 92 items. Later an additional automatic pistol was found, bringing the total to 93. Still later, for reasons not relevant here, 4 of the seized firearms were returned to Mulcahey’s wife, leaving 89 firearms as the subject of the forfeiture proceeding.

   Mulcahey relies heavily upon Congress’ labeling of §924 with the appellation “Penalties,” arguing that inclusion of the forfeiture provision in that section demonstrates Congress’ intention to create an additional criminal sanction.
