**Dissenting Opinion**
 * To the extent it has secured valid convictions in some courts in reliance on Bramblett , the Government should not now be forced to endure requests for habeas relief that will inevitably be filed in the wake of the Court’s opinion.  The additional comments set forth in the concurring opinion equally disregard the respect due a unanimous decision rendered by six Justices who took the same oath of office sworn by the six Justices who overrule Bramblett today.  The doctrine of stare decisis presumes to reinforce the notion that justice is dispensed according to law and not to serve *724 “the proclivities of individuals.” Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986).  The opinion of one Justice that another’s view of a statute was wrong, even really wrong, does not overcome the institutional advantages conferred by adherence to stare decisis in cases where the wrong is fully redressable by a coordinate branch of government.  This, then, is clearly a case where it is better that the matter be decided than that it be decided right.  Bramblett governs this case, and if the rule of that case is to be overturned it should be at the hands of Congress, and not of this Court. > For false statements made to Bankruptcy Courts, see United States v.
