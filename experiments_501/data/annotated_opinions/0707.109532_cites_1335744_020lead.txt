 *161 The judge further charged the jury that in determining what sentence was appropriate the jury was free to consider the facts and circumstances, if any, presented by the parties in mitigation or aggravation.  Finally, the judge instructed the jury that it “would not be authorized to consider [imposing] the penalty of death” unless it first found beyond a reasonable doubt-one of these aggravating circumstances: “One — That the offense of murder was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of two other capital felonies, to-wit the armed robbery of [Simmons and Moore].  “Two — That the offender committed the offense of murder for the purpose of receiving money and the automobile described in the indictment.  “Three — The offense of murder was outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman, in that they [sic] involved the depravity of [the] mind of the .defendant.” Tr. 476-477.  Finding the first and second of these circumstances, the jury returned verdicts of death on each count.  The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the convictions and the imposition of the death sentences for murder.  <citedDecision>233 Ga. 117</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>210 S. E. 2d 659</citedDecision> (1974).  After reviewing the trial transcript and the record, including the evidence, and comparing the evidence and sentence in similar cases in accordance with the requirements of Georgia law, the court concluded that, considering the nature of the crime and the defendant, the sentences of death had not resulted from prejudice or any other arbitrary factor and were not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty applied in similar cases. 2 The death *162 sentences imposed, for armed robbery, however, were vacated on the grounds that the death penalty had rarely been imposed in Georgia for that offense and that the jury improperly considered the murders as aggravating circumstances for the robberies after having considered the armed robberies as aggravating circumstances for the murders.  <citedDecision>Id., at 127</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>210 S. E. 2d, at 667</citedDecision> .  We granted the petitioner’s application for a writ of certiorari limited to his challenge to the imposition of the death sentences in this case as “cruel and unusual” punishment in violation of the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendments.  423 U. S. 1082 (1976).  II Before considering the issues presented it is necessary to understand the Georgia statutory scheme for the imposition of the death penalty.  3 The Georgia statute, as amended after our decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972), retains the death penalty for six categories of crime: murder, 4 kidnaping for ransom or where *163 the victim is harmed, armed robbery, 5 rape, treason, and aircraft hijacking.  6 Ga. Code Ann. §§ 26-1101 , 26-1311, 26-1902, 26-2001, 26-2201, 26-3301 (1972).  The capital defendant’s guilt or innocence is determined in the traditional manner, either by a trial judge or a jury, in the first stage of a bifurcated trial. If trial is by jury, the trial judge is required to charge lesser included offenses when they are supported by any view of the evidence.

 It is apparent that the Supreme Court of Georgia has taken its review responsibilities seriously.  In Coley , it held that “[t]he prior cases indicate that the past practice among juries faced with similar factual situations and like aggravating circumstances has been to impose only the sentence of life imprisonment for the offense of rape, rather than death.” 231 Ga., at 835 , 204 S. E. 2d, at 617 .  It thereupon reduced Coley's sentence from death to life imprisonment.  Similarly, although armed robbery is a capital offense under Georgia law, § 26-1902 (1972), the Georgia court concluded that the death sentences imposed in this case for that crime were “unusual in that they are rarely imposed for [armed robbery], Thus, under the test provided by statute, .  .  .  they must be considered to be excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.” 233 *206 Ga., at 127, <citedDecision>210 S. E. 2d, at 667</citedDecision> .  The court therefore vacated Gregg's death sentences for armed robbery and has followed a similar course in every other armed robbery death penalty case to come before it.  See Floyd v. State, 233 Ga. 280, 285 , 210 S. E. 2d 810, 814 (1974); Jarrell v. State, 234 Ga., at 424-425, 216 S. E. 2d, at 270 .  See Dorsey v. State, 236 Ga. 591 , 225 S. E. 2d 418 (1976).  The provision for appellate review in the Georgia capital-sentencing system serves as a check against the random or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.  In particular, the proportionality review substantially eliminates the possibility that a person will be sentenced to die by the action of an aberrant jury.  If a time comes when juries generally do not impose the death sentence in a certain kind of murder case, the appellate review procedures assure that no defendant convicted under such circumstances will suffer a sentence of death.
