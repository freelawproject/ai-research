**Combined Opinion**
ยง 2243. The 1966 amendments to the habeas corpus statute seem specifically to contemplate the possibility of relief other than immediate release from physical custody. At one point, the new ยง 2244 (b) (1964 ed., Supp. II) speaks in terms of "release from custody or other remedy." See Peyton v. Rowe, supra ; Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U.S. 335 (1968). Cf. Ex parte Hull, <targetCase>312 U.S. 546</targetCase> (1941). In the present case, petitioner filed his application shortly after June 20, 1963, while he was in custody. He was not released from custody until March 6, 1967, two weeks before he filed his petition for certiorari here. During the intervening period his application was under consideration in various courts. Petitioner is entitled to consideration of his application for relief on its merits. He is suffering, and will continue to suffer, serious disabilities because of the law's complexities and not because of his fault, if his claim that he has been illegally convicted is meritorious. There is no need in the statute, the Constitution, or sound jurisprudence for denying to petitioner his ultimate day in court.
