As litigants raising\\nthese constitutional issues, Plaintiffs were required by Illinois Supreme Court Rule 19 to serve notice\\nof their Complaint on Attorney General.  To Defendant\\u2019s knowledge, Plaintiffs have not done so to\\ndate.  A copy of Defendant\\u2019s February 13, 2007 letter notice to the Illinois Attorney General\\nproviding the requisite Rule 19 notice is attached as Exhibit A to this motion.\\nA. In support of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, Defendant states as follows:\\n1. This action was commenced in the Circuit Court for the Tenth Judicial Circuit,\\nPutnam County, Illinois on December 20, 2006.  Plaintiffs\\u2019 Complaint asserts that the method\\nprescribed by state law for electing members of Defendant\\u2019s Board of Education has deprived them\\nof equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\\nConstitution.\\nThe Complaint also asserts that the Illinois School Code provisions in question violate Article III,\\nSection 3 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, which states that \\u201c[a]ll elections shall be free and equal.\\u201d\\n   2.  Defendant removed the action to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1441(b) and 1446\\non January 12, 2007.  Subject matter jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1331 in light of the\\nfederal questions presented, and under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1367(a) with respect to the related state claims.\\n3.  The Complaint alleges that pertinent parts of Article 9 of the Illinois School Code \\u2013 and\\nin particular, the section thereof which provides that all voters in certain multi-township school\\ndistricts shall elect all seven members of the board of education, but restricts the membership of the\\nboard to a maximum of three members residing in any single township \\u2013 violates the principle of\\n\\u201cone person, one vote\\u201d as applied to Plaintiffs and other residents of Township 32N, R1W, pleaded\\n\\u2013 2 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 3 of 13 \\nto be the majority population township in Defendant District 535.  See Complaint paragraphs 9\\nthrough 12.  (Although not specifically cited by Plaintiffs in their Complaint, this provision is found\\nin \\u00a7 9-12 of the School Code at 105 ILCS 5/9-12 and more specifically, in Ballot Format 4 set out\\ntherein and applicable to District 535.) \\n4.  The Complaint also alleges that this law unconstitutionally crimps the opportunity of\\nwould-be candidates residing in the majority population township to be elected to the school board.\\n5.  Plaintiffs\\u2019 Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to\\nstate any claim on which relief can be granted, in that controlling case law refutes both of the above\\npropositions.\\n6.  \\u201c[A]s a general rule, whenever a state or local government decides to elect persons by\\npopular election to perform governmental functions,  the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\\nAmendment requires that each qualified voter must be given an equal opportunity to participate in\\nthe election, and when members of an elected body are chosen from separate districts, each district\\nmust be established on a basis that will ensure, as far as practicable, that equal numbers of voters can\\nvote for proportionally equal numbers of officials.\\u201d  Hadley v. Junior Coll. Dist., 397 U.S. 50, 56,\\n90 S.Ct. 791, 795 (1970) (emphasis added) (holding that the \\u201cone man, one vote\\u201d principle applied\\nto the election of the defendant college district\\u2019s trustees).\\n    7.  However, as the Hadley Court went on to state, this holding did not inhibit states from\\nfinding ways to ensure that legitimate political goals of representation are achieved. \\u201cWe have\\npreviously upheld against constitutional challenge an election scheme that required that candidates\\nbe residents of certain districts that did not contain equal numbers of people.  Dusch v. Davis, 387\\n\\u2013 3 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 4 of 13 \\nU.S. 112, 87 S.Ct. 1554 (1967).  Since all the officials in that case were elected at large, the right of\\neach voter was given equal treatment.\\u201d  Hadley, 397 U.S. at 58,  90 S.Ct. at 796.\\n8.  Dusch v. Davis disposes of Plaintiffs\\u2019 one person, one vote argument in this case.  In\\nDusch, the Court rejected an Equal Protection Clause challenge to a so-called \\u201cSeven-Four Plan\\u201d for\\nelecting members of the Virginia Beach City Council.  Under that plan, each of the 11 council\\nmembers was elected by a vote of all the electors in the City.  Four members were elected at large\\nwithout regard to residence.   Each of the remaining seven council members had to reside in the\\nborough from which he or she was elected.\\n9.   Delivering the opinion of the Dusch Court, Justice Douglas explained why this residence\\nrequirement was constitutionally unobjectionable: \\u201cIn upholding a residence requirement for the\\nelection of state senators from a multi-district county we said in Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433,\\n85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 201:  \\u2018 It is not accurate to treat a senator from a multi-district county\\nas the representative of only that district within the county wherein he resides.  The statute uses\\ndistricts in multi-district counties merely as the basis of residence for candidates, not for voting or\\nrepresentation.  Each district\\u2019s senator must be a resident of that district, but since his tenure depends\\nupon the county-wide electorate he must be vigilant to serve the interests of all the people in the\\ncounty, and not merely those of people in this home district; thus in fact he is the county\\u2019s and not\\nmerely the district\\u2019s senator.\\u2019\\u201d  Dusch v. Davis, 387 U.S. at 115, 87 S.Ct. at 1555-56.\\n10.  Likewise in this case, it is not accurate to treat a school board member elected by all the\\nvoters of a district of multiple congressional townships, as the representative of only that township\\nin which the board member resides.  Each school board member must be attentive to the needs and\\ninterests of the entire district electorate which votes the board member into (or out of) office.\\n\\u2013 4 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 5 of 13 \\n11.  Plaintiffs\\u2019 claim that the School Code provisions at issue violate their Fourteenth\\nAmendment rights as voters fails to state a claim, in light of the Supreme Court\\u2019s decision in Dusch\\nv. Davis, handed down nearly 40 years ago and cited and followed in many lower court cases.  See,\\ne.g., La Port County Republic Cent. Comm., 43 F.3d 1126, 1129 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding that\\nresidence districts need not have identical \\u201cor even similar\\u201d populations because voters may cast\\nballots for each of three county board positions, and affirming dismissal of suit on the pleadings);\\nHurlbut v. Scheetz, 804 F.2d 462 (8th Cir. 1986) (approving election system requiring at-large voting\\nin school board elections in sparsely populated North Dakota district, including restriction that\\nballots group candidates by residence and that one candidate be elected from each of five geographic\\nareas:  \\u201c[p]reserving distinct viewpoints of scattered geographical areas within a single governmental\\nentity has been recognized by the Supreme Court [in Dusch] as a sufficient justification for use of\\ngeographic residency requirements in conjunction with an at an-large voting scheme\\u201d);  Jt. Sch. Dist.\\nNo. 2 v. State Appeal Bd., 83 Wis.2d 711, 726, 266 N.W.2d 375, 381-82 (S.Ct. Wis. 1978) (electing\\none board member from each of nine former elementary school districts,  reorganized with a union\\nhigh school into a K-12 district, did not unconstitutionally \\u201cdilute\\u201d votes of residents in more\\npopulous districts: under Dusch, voting districts of unequal population are permissible if board is\\nelected at large and member of board represents the entire district);  Goldblatt v. City of Dallas, 414\\nF.2d 774, 775-76 (1969) (\\u201cappellant wisely does not contend that the Dallas \\u2018six-three\\u2019 city council\\nelection structure is unconstitutional per se\\u201d, the Supreme Court having specifically approved an\\nanalogous plan in Dusch: the one man-one vote principle is automatically complied with because\\nall votes are equal in a city-wide election).\\n\\u2013 5 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 6 of 13 \\n12.  Plaintiffs also assert that the residency restrictions in the challenged School Code\\nprovisions violate their Fourteenth Amendment rights as would-be candidates for the Board of\\nEducation.  They contend the law is fatally flawed in that, as pleaded in paragraph 10 of the\\nComplaint, it \\u201cprohibits plaintiffs and other similarly situated residents of Township 32N, R1W\\n...from being elected to said board despite having received more votes than residents of other\\ntownships in said District\\u201d.\\n13.   This assertion, too, fails to state a claim and should be dismissed pursuant to F.R.Civ.P.\\n12(b)(6).  Under the case law cited above, and to paraphrase Goldblatt v. City of Dallas, 414 F.2d\\nat 776, the possibility that a particular resident candidate wins in his township but loses district-wide\\ndoes not amount to discrimination against either the candidate or against the voters of that township:\\n\\u201cThe election is [district]-wide, and the elected official is a representative of the entire [district], not\\nmerely of a particular [township].\\u201d\\n14.  Even if the residency requirement were to be viewed as a species of ballot access\\nrestriction  \\u2013  which it is not, there being no limit to the number of Township 32N, R1W residents\\nwho may vie for such of the total three school board seats \\u201creserved\\u201d for them as may be open in any\\ngiven school board election \\u2013 the State\\u2019s interest in fostering geographic diversity on school boards\\nof large, multi-township districts is sufficient to justify the calibrated limitations reflected in the\\nprovisions of School Code \\u00a7 9-12.   \\n15.  Courts evaluate ballot access restrictions under a flexible standard that weighs the\\n\\u201c\\u2018character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth\\nAmendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate\\u2019 against \\u2018the precise interests put forward by the\\nState as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,\\u2019 taking into consideration \\u2018the extent to\\n\\u2013 6 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 7 of 13 \\nwhich those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff\\u2019s rights.\\u2019\\u201d  Lee v. Keith, 463 F.3d 763,\\n768  (7th Cir. 2006), quoting Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059 (1992), quoting\\nin turn Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 at 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564 (1983).   \\u201cUnder this standard,\\nthe rigorousness of...inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to\\nwhich a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\\u201d  Burdick, 504 U.S.\\nat 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059.  Restrictions that severely burden the exercise of constitutional rights must\\nbe narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance (such as education, see\\nFumarolo v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 142 Ill.2d 54, 566 N.E.2d 1283, 1299 (1990)), whereas\\n\\u201creasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\\u201d that impose less substantial burdens are generally\\njustified by the state\\u2019s \\u201cimportant regulatory interests\\u201d.  Id.    \\n16.  Unlike Illinois\\u2019 demanding ballot access rules struck down in Lee v. Keith, which in\\ncombination made it well-nigh impossible for independent candidates to run for election to the State\\nlegislature,  the electoral method objected to by Plaintiffs in this case does not severely burden, let\\nalone have the effect of \\u201cthoroughly excluding\\u201d (cf. Lee, 463 F.3d at 769) candidates from the\\nmajority population township entering a school board race.  Far from it:  three of the seven school\\nboard members may be elected from a candidate pool supplied by residents of Township 32N, R1W.\\n17.  Moreover, and as highlighted below, School Code \\u00a7 9-12 read as a whole is carefully\\ncalibrated to serve Illinois\\u2019 important \\u2013 if not compelling \\u2013  interest in bringing about, under\\npolitically palatable conditions, the consolidation of the State\\u2019s smaller school systems into unit\\nschool districts to more efficiently and cost-effectively secure public education of good quality for\\nstudents in grades K through 12. \\n\\u2013 7 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 8 of 13 \\n   18.  District 535's Board of Education is currently elected using the \\u201cFormat 4\\\" Official\\nBallot prescribed by School Code \\u00a7 9-12, which applies (insofar as pertinent for present purposes)\\nto community unit school districts formed prior to January 1, 1975 when the territory of the school\\ndistrict is greater than two congressional townships, or 72 square miles, except for those community\\nunit school districts formed prior to January 1, 1975 that only elect board members at large and\\nwithout restriction by area of residence within the district.  As District 535 does not fall within the\\nlatter excepted category,  its school board elections use the Format 4 ballot,  which provides that \\u201cnot\\nmore than 3 board members may be selected from any one congressional township\\u201d, and which\\napplies \\u201conly when less than 75% of the population. is in one congressional township\\u201d.  105 ILCS\\n5/9-12 \\u201cFORMAT 4\\u201d.1\\n19.   If and when at least 75% but less than 90% of the population of such a district resides\\nin one congressional township, then the number of school board members to be selected from that\\none township increases to four, and the remaining three board members are selected from the district\\n1  Plaintiffs plead the facts which illustrate the applicability of Format 4 only obliquely, in Complaint paragraph\\n10 which asserts, \\u201cUnder the provisions of 105 ILCS 5/11A-8, succeeded by 105 ILCS 5/9, only three of the\\nseven members of the Board of Education of Putnam Community Unit School District # 535 may reside in\\nTownship 32 N R1W of the 3rd Principal Meridian, notwithstanding the fact that a majority of the residents of\\nsaid District reside in said township.\\u201d  (Emphasis added). \\nReferenced \\u00a7 11A-8 of the School Code (105 ILCS 5/11A-8) described the requirements for passage of\\nreferenda  to  create  a  community  unit  school  district  and,  in  the  cases  of  community  unit  districts\\nencompassing more than two congressional townships or 72 square miles, prescribed the geographic\\nrepresentation requirements calibrated to population which are contained in the Official Ballot Formats set out\\nin School Code \\u00a7 9-12, reviewed above.

Plaintiffs are not entitled to such extraordinary equitable relief, nor to any relief at all.\\n The automatic adjustments of school board electoral mechanisms built into School Code \\u00a7 9-12\\nrepresent exactly the type of narrow tailoring  courts look for, in evaluating whether a ballot access\\nrestriction exceeds what is needed to serve a compelling state interest in situations where election\\nlaw restrictions impose a \\u201csevere\\u201d burden on rights of potential candidates. \\n22.  But again, School Code \\u00a7 9-12's election provisions do not place a \\u201csevere\\u201d burden on\\nprospective school board candidates from majority population townships, and find explicit sanction\\nin the U.S. Supreme Court\\u2019s decisions in Dusch and Hadley.   Any judicial evaluation of the election\\nprovisions  in  \\u00a7  9-12  must  proceed  under  the  standard  which  applies  to  \\u201creasonable\\nnondiscriminatory restrictions\\u201d which impose modest \\u201cburdens\\u201d to serve important State regulatory\\ninterests, see Lee v. Keith, above.  The provisions of the School Code challenged by Plaintiffs readily\\nsatisfy that standard.\\n\\u2013 9 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 10 of 13 \\n23.  Last but not least,  the de minimus and constitutionally permissible \\u201cburdens\\u201d assertedly\\nimposed by School Code \\u00a7 9-12's applicable provisions are further alleviated by the fact that School\\nCode \\u00a7 9-22 provides a method by which Plaintiffs and their fellow electors / would-be candidates\\nresident in Township 32N, R1W can initiate a referendum on the proposition of electing school\\nboard members by school board districts if they deem that system preferable, instead of district-wide\\nas is presently done. \\n24.  Section 9-22 authorizes such a referendum if initiated by the board of education, or on\\npetition of the lesser of 2,500 or 5% of registered voters of the district.  The proposition passes if a\\nsimple majority of voters, district-wide, approves it.  Thus, if District 535 voters in Township 32N\\nR1W want to eliminate the alleged unequal burdening of their rights as candidates by adopting an\\nelection-by-district system, then as the most populous group of electors in the district they have\\nample political power to attain this fully adequate remedy at law.\\n25.  Dismissal of Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims insofar as they are founded on the \\u201cfree and fair elections\\u201d\\nprovisions of the Article III, Section 3 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution is also warranted.  The\\nIllinois Supreme Court has equated the Illinois Constitution\\u2019s guarantee of \\u201cequal protection of the\\nlaws\\u201d, and the \\u201cfree and equal\\u201d requirements of Article III, Section 3, with protections afforded by\\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stating that no precedent suggests that\\nthe Illinois Constitution calls for more than the Federal Constitution in relation to equal protection\\nsafeguards.

Because Plaintiffs\\u2019 action contests the validity of Defendant\\u2019s Board of Education as\\nelected pursuant to the challenged statutes, and the right of current Board members to hold their\\noffices, it critically affects not only Putnam County Community Unit School District No. 235 but\\nother Illinois school districts in which elections are subject to the mandatory board representation\\nprovisions of School Code \\u00a7 9-12.   \\n3.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (\\u201cBOP\\u201d) has established two separate systems to \\ncalculate its residents\\u2019 \\u201ccriminal history scores,\\u201d a number that is used to determine Plaintiffs\\u2019 \\nsecurity classification, i.e. the security level of the prisons in which Plaintiffs are placed, and their \\neligibility for home confinement and release to a halfway house. \\n2.  These  two,  separate  criminal  history  scoring  systems  apply  arbitrarily  and \\nunequally to BOP residents based on the court from which they were sentenced \\u2014 federal district \\ncourts or another court system, such as the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, other state \\ncourts, or military tribunals.  This action specifically challenges the application of a different \\ncriminal history scoring rule to the group of individuals that are sentenced by the Superior Court \\nfor the District of Columbia and transferred to BOP custody to serve their sentences, i.e. Plaintiffs \\nand proposed class. \\n3.  The first system \\u2014 which is based on Chapter 4 of the United States Sentencing \\nGuidelines\\u2019 calculation of criminal history points \\u2014 applies to the vast majority of BOP residents \\nwho were sentenced by a federal district court and who enter the BOP with a commitment order, \\na statement of reasons, and/or a presentence report that lists their Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\nhistory points.  For these residents, the BOP simply relies upon their Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 \\ncriminal history points to determine their criminal history score. \\n4.  The second system applies to the small minority of BOP residents who do not enter \\nthe BOP with a Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal history points calculation, including individuals \\nwho were sentenced by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, other state courts, or \\nmilitary tribunals.  See U.S. DEP\\u2019T OF JUSTICE, FED. BUREAU OF PRISONS, PROGRAM STATEMENT \\n  2 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 3 of 33\\n5100.08: INMATE SECURITY DESIGNATION & CUSTODY CLASSIFICATION (\\u201cPS 5100.08\\u201d) 33 (2006).  \\nFor  those  residents,  including  Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members,  the  BOP\\u2019s  Program \\nStatement 5100.08 applies a separate scoring system to tabulate their criminal history points and \\nthen converts those points into a criminal history score. \\n5.  In the overwhelming number of cases, people subject to the second system receive \\nhigher criminal history scores than people subject to the first system.  In other words, the BOP\\u2019s \\nProgram Statement 5100.08 yields more criminal history points \\u2014 and a higher criminal history \\nscore \\u2014 than the criminal history points calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines for similarly \\nsituated incarcerated people. \\n6.  Because the criminal history score is the most significant factor in determining \\nsomeone\\u2019s security classification, individuals with higher criminal history scores are more likely \\nto be incarcerated in a high security facility.  As a result of BOP\\u2019s arbitrary and unequal criminal \\nhistory scoring system, Plaintiffs and proposed class members are more likely to be incarcerated \\nin high security BOP facilities, where they are subjected to greater violence and offered fewer \\nprogramming opportunities, and they are denied opportunities to seek release to home confinement \\nthat might otherwise be available to them. \\n7.  Empirical evidence bears this unequal treatment out.  Twelve percent of BOP \\nresidents overall are incarcerated in high security institutions, whereas 39 percent of \\u201cD.C. Code \\noffenders\\u201d are housed in those institutions.  See COUNCIL FOR COURT EXCELLENCE, ANALYSIS OF \\nBOP DATA SNAPSHOT FROM JULY 4, 2020 FOR THE DISTRICT TASK FORCE ON JAILS AND JUSTICE 4 \\n(2020),  http://www.courtexcellence.org/uploads/publications/Analysis_of_BOP_Data_Snapshot \\n_from_7420.pdf.  Plaintiffs and proposed class members  are three times more likely to be \\n  3 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 4 of 33\\nincarcerated in a high security penitentiary than other BOP residents and could be systematically \\nexcluded from seeking release to home confinement. \\n8.  The  BOP\\u2019s  separate  scoring  system  also  disproportionately  affects  its  Black \\nresidents as 95.6 percent of people who are sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court and who are in \\nBOP custody are Black.  See COUNCIL FOR COURT EXCELLENCE, ANALYSIS OF BOP DATA \\nSNAPSHOT FROM JULY 4, 2020 FOR THE DISTRICT TASK FORCE ON JAILS AND JUSTICE 2 (2020), \\nhttp://www.courtexcellence.org/uploads/publications/Analysis_of_BOP_Data_Snapshot_from_7\\n420.pdf.  By contrast, the majority of individuals sentenced by federal district courts are white.  \\nThe BOP tracks the racial composition of individuals in its custody and at individual facilities and \\nis aware of the racial differences between the two populations.  Applying a harsher criminal history \\nscoring system to the majority-Black population of individuals sentenced by the Superior Court \\nfor the District of Columbia puts them at a significant disadvantage to their majority-white federal \\ncounterparts.  This is doubly concerning because the BOP\\u2019s own regulations make clear that \\u201cstaff \\nshall not discriminate against inmates on the basis of race * * * [in] providing access to work, \\nhousing and programs.\\u201d  28 C.F.R. \\u00a7 551.90. \\n9.  The BOP\\u2019s two-tiered system for calculating criminal history scores is arbitrary, \\ncapricious, and contrary to law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 501 \\net seq., and unconstitutional in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment, \\nU.S. Cons. amend. V.  \\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \\n10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\nSection 1331 because it arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States. \\n  4 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 5 of 33\\n11.  Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 2201 and 2202, by 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 702, by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and 65, and by the \\ninherent equitable powers of this Court. \\n12.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1391(e)(1) because a substantial \\npart of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred, and continue to occur, in this \\nDistrict. \\nPARTIES \\n13.  Plaintiff Jonathan Blades was convicted of D.C. Code offenses and is serving his \\nsentence in the Bureau of Prisons.  Mr. Blades is Black and currently incarcerated at United States \\nPenitentiary (USP) Pollock, a high security penitentiary located in Pollock, Louisiana.   \\n14.  Mr.  Blades\\u2019  criminal  history  points  were  assessed  under  Program  Statement \\n5100.08, and not the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, because Mr. Blades was sentenced in the \\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia and is serving his sentence in BOP custody.  \\n15.  If Mr. Blades\\u2019 criminal history points were scored under the Sentencing Guidelines, \\nhis criminal history points would be lower than they currently are because the Sentencing \\nGuidelines would not award points for his juvenile probationary sentences or for his 2002 adult \\nprobationary sentences that occurred more than 10 years prior to the instant offense. \\n16.  Plaintiff Antwan Buchanan was convicted of D.C. Code offenses and is serving his \\nsentence in the Bureau of Prisons.  Mr. Buchanan is Black and is currently incarcerated at USP \\nBig Sandy, a high security penitentiary located in Inez, Kentucky. \\n17.  Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s criminal history points were assessed under Program Statement \\n5100.08, and not the Sentencing Guidelines, because Mr. Buchanan was sentenced in the Superior \\nCourt of the District of Columbia and is serving his sentence in BOP custody.  \\n  5 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 6 of 33\\n18.  If  Mr.  Buchanan\\u2019s  criminal  history  points  were  scored  under  the  Sentencing \\nGuidelines, his criminal history points would be lower than they currently are because the \\nSentencing Guidelines would not count a 2002 conviction and a 2004 conviction and he would \\nreceive fewer criminal history points for his 2006 and 2008 convictions. \\n19.  Defendant Michael Carvajal is sued in his official capacity as Director, Federal Bureau \\nof Prisons.  In this capacity, Defendant Carvajal oversees the operations of the Federal Bureau of \\nPrisons. \\nBACKGROUND \\n20.  Congress requires the Bureau of Prisons to consider \\u201cthe history and characteristics \\nof the prisoner\\u201d as well as a \\u201cprisoner\\u2019s security designation\\u201d when designating prisoners to \\ncorrectional facilities.  18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 3621(b). \\n21.  Pursuant to that statutory requirement, the BOP issued Program Statement 5100.08 \\nin 2006, outlining how the BOP would weigh those factors when designating individuals to prisons \\nacross the country.   \\n22.  BOP institutions fall into \\u201cfive security levels\\u201d: \\u201cMINIMUM, LOW, MEDIUM, \\nHIGH, and ADMINISTRATIVE.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 7. \\n23.  To designate prisoners into one of those five security levels of institutions, the BOP \\nrelies on a set of inputs to \\u201ccalculate[] a [security] point score for [an] inmate which * * * is then \\nmatched with a commensurate security level institution.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 8.  \\n24.  Subject to certain caveats, an individual with a security point score between 0 and \\n11 security points is matched to a minimum security facility, between 12 and 15 security points to \\na low security facility, between 16 and 23 security points to a medium security facility, and 24 and \\nover security points to a high security facility.  See PS 5100.08 at 8. \\n  6 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 7 of 33\\n25.  The BOP relies on a set of established factors to determine the security point score, \\nincluding \\u201cvoluntary surrender,\\u201d the \\u201cseverity of current offense,\\u201d \\u201chistory of violence,\\u201d \\u201chistory \\nof escape or attempts,\\u201d \\u201ctype of detainer,\\u201d \\u201cage,\\u201d \\u201ceducation level,\\u201d \\u201cdrug and alcohol abuse,\\u201d and \\n\\u201ccriminal history score.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 30\\u201338.  To calculate the total security point score, the \\nBOP adds up the points assigned to each of these criteria.  Id. at 41.  \\n26.  The BOP explains in Program Statement 5100.08 that the \\u201ccriminal history score\\u201d \\nis \\u201cone of the factors used to calculate the inmate\\u2019s security point total.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 10.  \\n27.  The criminal history score is one of the most influential categories in determining \\nthe total security point total.  For example, while the \\u201cseverity of current offense\\u201d category can \\nincrease the security point by a maximum of seven points for the \\u201cgreatest\\u201d severity offense, the \\ncriminal history score can increase the security point score by ten points \\u2014 a difference large \\nenough on its own to move a prisoner from a low security facility to a high security facility.  See \\nPS 5100.08 at 8, 32\\u201333. \\n28.  Program Statement 5100.08 establishes two systems for deriving criminal history \\nscores. \\n29.  The vast majority of prisoners in BOP custody are convicted of federal offenses \\nand sentenced by federal district courts.  For those individuals \\u2014 referred to here as \\u201cindividuals \\nwith federal sentences\\u201d \\u2014 their \\u201c[criminal history score] is derived from the US Sentencing \\nGuidelines Criminal History Points, as reflected in the final judgment and the [statement of \\nreasons].  If not found in either the Judgment or [statement of reasons],\\u201d the BOP \\u201cuse[s] the points \\nassessed by the [United States Probation Office] in the [Presentence Report].\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n  7 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 8 of 33\\n30.  The BOP converts the Sentencing Guidelines criminal history points into a criminal \\nhistory score using the conversion table depicted below.  That criminal history score is then used \\nto determine the security point score.   \\nCriminal History Points  Criminal History Score \\n0 to 1 point  0 \\n2 to 3 points  2 \\n4 to 6 points  4 \\n7 to 9 points  6 \\n10 to 12 points  8 \\n13 or more points  10 \\n \\nPS 5100.08 at 33.  For instance, based on the table above, a person with five criminal history points \\nreceives a criminal history score of four.  See PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\n31.  For individuals in BOP custody who are sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court1 \\u2014 \\nreferred to here as \\u201cindividuals with D.C. sentences\\u201d \\u2014 the BOP applies a different rule set forth \\nin Program Statement 5100.08 to calculate their criminal history points, which is then converted \\nto a criminal history score pursuant to the conversion table in Paragraph 30.  See PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n32.  Unlike individuals with federal sentences, individuals with D.C. sentences do not \\nenter the BOP with \\u201cUS Sentencing Guidelines Criminal History Points\\u201d that are \\u201creflected in the \\nfinal judgment,\\u201d a judicial statement of reasons, or a Presentence Report.  PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n                                                 \\n1 Pursuant to the Revitalization Act, nearly all individuals sentenced to felonies by the D.C. \\nSuperior Court are immediately transferred to BOP custody to serve out their sentences.  For that \\nreason, individuals with D.C. Code convictions comprise the bulk of individuals affected by the \\nBOP\\u2019s rudimentary and arbitrary scoring scheme.  Because this lawsuit focuses on the unfair \\ntreatment of individuals with D.C. Code convictions, only that group will be referenced throughout \\nthe motion.  It is worth noting, however, that the criminal history scoring of individuals serving \\nother state or military tribunal sentences is equally unfair and arbitrary for the same reasons. \\n  8 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 9 of 33\\n33.  Program  Statement  5100.08\\u2019s  rule  for  calculating  criminal  history  points  for \\nindividuals with D.C. sentences is materially different than the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\nhistory points calculation that the BOP relies on for individuals with federal sentences.   \\n34.  Under Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s rule for individuals with D.C. sentences, the \\nBOP does not rely on any previous calculation of criminal history points and undertakes the \\ncalculation itself after obtaining an \\u201cNCIC III Report,\\u201d a criminal history report derived from the \\nNational Crime Information Center database maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  \\nPS 5100.08 at 33. \\n35.  After obtaining the NCIC III Report, Program Statement 5100.08 instructs the BOP \\nto calculate the criminal history points for individuals with D.C. sentences as follows: \\na. Add 3 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one \\nyear and one month; \\nb. Add 2 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least \\nsixty days not counted in (a); \\nc. Add 1 point for each prior conviction not counted in (a) or (b), up to \\na total of 4 points for this item; and, \\nd. Add 2 points if the instant offense is a revocation accompanied by a \\nnew state or federal conviction, or if the instant offense occurred \\nwhile under federal supervision including incarceration, probation, \\nparole or supervised release. \\n \\nPS 5100.08 at 33. \\n \\n36.  The BOP\\u2019s calculation of criminal history points under Program Statement 5100.08 \\nis then converted to a criminal history score based on the table depicted in Paragraph 30.  \\n37.  The system the BOP uses to calculate criminal history points for individuals with \\nD.C. sentences results in systematically higher criminal history scores than their similarly situated \\nfederal counterparts.  This leads to higher, more restrictive security designations for individuals \\nwith D.C. sentences as compared to individuals with federal sentences that have identical criminal \\nhistories. \\n  9 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 10 of 33\\n38.  The Sentencing Guidelines generally does not award criminal history points for the \\nfollowing categories of offenses and sentences whereas the BOP\\u2019s scoring rule contains no such \\nexceptions or limitations:  \\na.  Stale offenses and sentences \\nb.  Petty offenses \\nc.  Juvenile offenses \\nd.  Suspended sentences \\ne.  Multiple sentences for offenses in the same charging instrument or that were \\nsentenced on the same day \\n \\nStale offenses and sentences \\n \\n39.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards three points for a \\u201cprior sentence of \\nimprisonment exceeding one year and one month\\u201d that was \\u201cimposed within fifteen years of the \\ndefendant\\u2019s  commencement  of  the  instant  offense.\\u201d  United  States  Sentencing  Commission, \\nGuidelines Manual, \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(a), 4A1.2(e)(1) (emphasis added).  This includes any sentence \\n\\u201cexceeding one year and one month, whenever imposed, that resulted in the [individual] being \\nincarcerated during any part of such fifteen-year period.\\u201d  Id. \\n40.  In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards three points for \\n\\u201ceach prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month\\u201d regardless of when that \\nsentence was imposed, PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n41.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards two points for \\u201ceach prior sentence of \\nimprisonment of at least sixty days not counted in [\\u00a74A1.1(a)],\\u201d USSG \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(b), only if that \\nsentence \\u201cwas imposed within ten years of the defendant\\u2019s commencement of the instant offense,\\u201d \\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2) (emphasis added). \\n42.  In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards two points \\u201cfor \\neach prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days [but not greater than one year and one \\nmonth],\\u201d regardless of when that sentence was imposed.  PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n  10 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 11 of 33\\n43.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards one point for \\u201cfor each prior sentence not \\ncounted in [\\u00a7 4A1.1](a) or [\\u00a7 4A1.1](b), up to a total of 4 points,\\u201d USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(c), only if that \\nsentence \\u201cwas imposed within ten years of the defendant's commencement of the instant offense,\\u201d  \\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). \\n44.  In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards one point \\u201cfor \\neach prior conviction not [previously] counted * * * up to a total of 4 points for this item,\\u201d \\nregardless of when that sentence was imposed.  PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\n45.  Consider an individual with a D.C. sentence who committed their \\u201cinstant offense\\u201d \\non January 1, 2015 and had the following criminal history: \\na.  Two-year prison sentence imposed on January 1, 1980 \\nb.  Six-month prison sentence imposed on January 1, 1984 \\nc.  Three-month probationary sentence imposed on January 1, 1986 \\n \\nUnder the BOP\\u2019s rule, that person would receive a total of six criminal history points (three points \\nfor the 1980 sentence, two points for the 1984 sentence, and one point for the 1986 sentence) for \\na criminal history score of four.  See PS 5100.08 at 33; supra \\u00b6 35.  \\n46.  A  similarly  situated  individual  with  a  federal  sentence  who  had  an  identical \\ncriminal history and an identical instant offense would receive zero criminal history points \\u2014 a \\ncriminal history score of zero \\u2014 because each of the three sentences imposed would be considered \\nstale and not count under the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal history points calculation. \\n47.  Because Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s rule does not contain a staleness exception \\nfor individuals with D.C. sentences, unlike the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 points calculation for \\nindividuals with federal sentences, the BOP\\u2019s rule systematically results in higher criminal history \\npoints and higher criminal history scores for Plaintiff and proposed class members, as compared \\nto similarly situated individuals with federal sentences.   \\n  11 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 12 of 33\\nPetty offenses \\n48.  The Sentencing Guidelines also limit the types of offenses for which criminal \\nhistory points are awarded.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c). \\n49.  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, certain \\u201cprior offenses and offenses similar to \\nthem,\\u201d including \\u201c[p]ublic intoxication,\\u201d \\u201c[l]oitering,\\u201d and \\u201c[v]agrancy,\\u201d are \\u201cnever counted\\u201d in a \\ncriminal history score.  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2). \\n50.  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, other \\u201cprior offenses and offenses similar to \\nthem,\\u201d  including  \\u201creckless  driving,\\u201d  \\u201c[t]respassing,\\u201d  \\u201c[c]ontempt  of  court,\\u201d  or  \\u201c[d]isorderly \\nconduct,\\u201d are \\u201ccounted only if (A) the sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or \\na term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an instant \\noffense.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). \\n51.  In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards criminal history \\npoints regardless of type of prior offense.  See PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n52.  For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a prior public intoxication \\noffense would receive criminal history points where as an individual with a federal sentence with \\na similar prior conviction would not. \\n53.  Likewise, an individual with a D.C. sentence with an instant drug sale offense and \\na prior conviction for driving without a license offense for which they received a sentence of 10 \\ndays of imprisonment would receive criminal history points, and potentially a higher criminal \\nhistory score, that a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence would not. \\n54.  As a result of this material difference in treatment of prior offenses, individuals \\nwith D.C. sentences systematically receive higher criminal history points, and therefore higher \\n  12 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 13 of 33\\ncriminal  history  scores,  as  compared  to  similarly  situated  federal  counterparts. \\nJuvenile offenses \\n55.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines limit the awarding of criminal history points for \\nprior offenses committed as a juvenile.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c).  \\n56.  The  Sentencing  Guidelines  award  two  criminal  history  points  for  each  prior \\njuvenile offense that resulted in \\u201cconfinement of at least sixty days\\u201d only when \\u201cthe defendant was \\nreleased from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense.\\u201d \\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(A). \\n57.  The Sentencing Guidelines award one criminal history point for each prior juvenile \\noffense that did not result in confinement of at least sixty days only if the \\u201csentence [was] imposed \\nwithin  five  years  of  the  defendant\\u2019s  commencement  of  the  instant  offense.\\u201d  USSG \\n\\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(B). \\n58.  While the Sentencing Guidelines award criminal history points only for juvenile \\noffenses imposed within a limited period of time, the BOP awards criminal history points for all \\njuvenile offenses without any limitations, see PS 5100.08 at 33.   \\n59.  For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a 1995 juvenile sentence that \\nresulted in ninety days\\u2019 imprisonment will receive two criminal history points, and a higher \\ncriminal history score, than a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence.  \\n60.  As a result of this material difference in treatment of juvenile offenses, individuals \\nwith D.C. sentences systematically receive higher criminal history points, and potentially higher \\ncriminal history scores, as compared to similarly situated federal counterparts. \\n \\n \\n  13 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 14 of 33\\nSuspended sentences \\n61.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines award three, two, or one criminal history points \\nfor each prior conviction depending on the length of sentence for those convictions.  See USSG \\n\\u00a7 4A1.1(a)-(c). \\n62.  To determine the length of sentence for prior convictions where \\u201cpart of a sentence \\nof imprisonment was suspended,\\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines consider only \\u201cthe portion that was \\nnot suspended.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(b)(2).  \\n63.  Like the Sentencing Guidelines, for individuals with D.C. sentences, Program \\nStatement 5100.08 also awards three, two, or one criminal history points for each prior conviction \\ndepending on the length of sentence for those prior convictions.  See PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n64.  Unlike the Sentencing Guidelines, the BOP considers the total length of sentence \\nof those prior convictions regardless of whether a portion of that sentence was suspended.  See PS \\n5100.08 at 33. \\n65.  For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a prior sentence of two years\\u2019 \\nimprisonment, suspended as to all but two months, would receive three criminal history points \\nunder Program Statement 5100.08.  By contrast, an individual with a federal sentence with the \\nsame prior sentence would receive only one criminal history point, and only if that prior conviction \\nwas an applicable offense and did not fall within the staleness exception.  \\n66.  As a result of this material difference in the treatment of suspended sentences, \\nindividuals  with  D.C.  sentences  systematically  receive  higher  criminal  history  points,  and \\ntherefore higher criminal history scores, as compared to similarly situated federal counterparts. \\n \\n \\n  14 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 15 of 33\\nMultiple sentences for offenses in the same charging instrument or that were sentenced on \\nthe same day \\n \\n67.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines treat certain prior sentences as a single sentence.  \\n68.  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, prior sentences that were not separated by an \\nintervening arrest are counted as one sentence for purposes of calculating criminal history points \\nif they \\u201cresulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument\\u201d or if \\u201cthe sentences \\nwere imposed on the same day.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). \\n69.  By contrast, Program Statement 5100.08 treats all prior sentences as separate \\nsentences for purposes of calculating criminal history points. \\n70.  For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence who previously received two \\nconcurrent sentences of 24 months\\u2019 imprisonment for two counts of possession of cocaine charged \\nin the same indictment would receive six criminal history points under Program Statement 5100.08 \\nbecause each sentence of 24 months would count as three points.  See PS 5100.08 at 33.  By \\ncontrast, a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence would only receive three criminal \\nhistory points under the same scenario because the Sentencing Guidelines would treat the two \\nconcurrent 24-month sentences as a sentence that \\u201cresulted from offenses contained in the same \\ncharging instrument.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). \\n71.  As a result of this material difference in treatment of sentences contained in the \\nsame  charging  instrument  or  charged  on  the  same  day,  individuals  with  D.C.  sentences \\nsystematically receive higher criminal history points, and therefore higher criminal history scores, \\nas compared to their similarly situated federal counterparts. \\n72.  In addition to greatly determining security designations, the BOP\\u2019s criminal history \\nscore also plays a significant role in determining a prisoner\\u2019s PATTERN risk assessment score. \\n  15 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 16 of 33\\n73.

Jonathan Blades was sentenced in docket number 2014 CF1 002153 in the Superior \\nCourt of the District of Columbia to a term of incarceration to be served in the BOP on March 20, \\n2015, for violations of D.C. Code provisions.   \\n79.  Following his sentencing, the BOP prepared a custody classification form for Mr. \\nBlades to determine his security classification score. \\n80.  As part of the BOP\\u2019s determination of Mr. Blades\\u2019 security classification score, the \\nBOP calculated Mr. Blades\\u2019 criminal history points and resulting criminal history score. \\n  16 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 17 of 33\\n81.  Because Mr. Blades was sentenced by the Superior Court for a D.C. Code offense, \\nthe BOP applied Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s scoring rule to determine Mr. Blades had six \\ncriminal history points, which converted to a criminal history score of four, see supra \\u00b6 30. \\n82.  Mr. Blades was assessed points under Program Statement 5100.08 that he would \\nnot have been assessed under the Sentencing Guidelines. \\n83.  According to Mr. Blades\\u2019 presentence report, he has seven prior convictions: \\na.  A 2002 juvenile conviction for carrying a dangerous weapon for which he received \\nprobation; \\nb.  A 2003 juvenile \\u201cOut of Probation\\u201d conviction for which he received probation; \\nc.  A  2002  adult  conviction  for  possession  of  marijuana  for  which  he  received \\nprobation, which was revoked to time served; \\nd.  A 2002 adult conviction for distribution of marijuana for which he received a \\nsuspended sentence of 180 days imprisonment with 3 years of probation; \\ne.  A 2006 adult conviction for reckless driving for which he received 10 days \\nimprisonment; \\nf.  A 2006 adult conviction for possession of a controlled substance and driving while \\nintoxicated for which he received a 90-day and 30-day suspended sentence with 12 \\nmonths of probation; \\ng.  A 2006 adult conviction for possession of a prohibited weapon for which he \\nreceived a 1-year sentence. \\n84.  Under Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s scoring rule, Mr. Blades received six criminal \\nhistory points.  \\n  17 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 18 of 33\\n85.  Mr.  Blades  likely  received  one  point  each  for  his  2002  and  2003  juvenile \\nconvictions (convictions (a) and (b) in paragraph 83) pursuant to subsection (c) of the BOP\\u2019s \\ncriminal history scoring rule: \\u201cAdd 1 point for each prior conviction not counted in (a) or (b),\\u201d PS \\n5100.08 at 33.  \\n86.  Mr. Blades likely received one point each for his 2002 convictions for possession \\nof marijuana and distribution of marijuana (convictions (c) and (d) in paragraph 83) pursuant to \\nsubsection (c) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule, PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n87.  Mr. Blades received two points for his 2006 adult conviction for possessing a \\nprohibited weapon (conviction (g) in paragraph 83) pursuant to subsection (b) of the BOP\\u2019s \\ncriminal history scoring rule: \\u201c2 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty \\ndays\\u201d and less than one year and one month, PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n88.  Had Mr. Blades been scored according to the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\nhistory points calculation, he would only have received three criminal history points, resulting \\nin a criminal history score of two: \\na.  Mr. Blades would receive one point for his 2006 adult convictions for possessing a \\ncontrolled substance offense and driving while intoxicated offense (conviction (f) \\nin paragraph 83) because there was no intervening arrest and he was sentenced on \\nthe same day for both offenses, see USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). \\nb.  Mr. Blades would receive two points for his 2006 adult conviction for possessing a \\nprohibited weapon (conviction (g) in paragraph 83) pursuant to USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(b). \\n89.  Mr. Blades would not have received any points for his two juvenile adjudications.  \\nSee USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(d) (excluding juvenile convictions unless they were committed close in time \\nto the instant offense). \\n  18 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 19 of 33\\n90.  Mr. Blades would not have received any points for his 2002 convictions for \\npossession  of  marijuana  and  distribution  of  marijuana.    See  USSG  \\u00a7  4A1.2(e)  (excluding \\nconvictions that did not result in more than one year and one month of incarceration unless the \\nsentence was imposed \\u201cwithin ten years of the defendant\\u2019s commencement of the instant offense\\u201d).  \\n91.  Mr. Blades would not have received any points for his 2006 conviction for reckless \\ndriving.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c) (\\u201creckless driving\\u201d not counted unless sentence was a term of \\nimprisonment of at least 30 days or was similar to instant offense). \\n92.  In part because of Mr. Blades\\u2019 arbitrarily higher criminal history score, he is being \\nincarcerated in a high security facility (USP) in the BOP. \\n93.  As a result of his incarceration in a high security facility, Mr. Blades is stigmatized \\nand treated worse than identically situated incarcerated people solely because of the court in which \\nhe was convicted. \\n94.  Mr. Blades has less access to educational and vocational programming at a high \\nsecurity facility compared to people incarcerated at lower security facilities. \\n95.  Because he is incarcerated at a high security facility, Mr. Blades is afforded fewer \\nliberties than BOP residents at medium or low security facilities, including less time out of his cell, \\nless time outside, and less freedom of movement. \\n96.  Because  he  is  incarcerated  at  a  high  security  facility,  Mr.  Blades  has  fewer \\nopportunities to speak with his family and his loved ones than BOP residents at medium or low \\nsecurity facilities \\n97.  Because he is incarcerated at a high security facility, Mr. Blades is subjected to \\nmore violence and disciplinary incidents than BOP residents at medium or low security facilities. \\n  19 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 20 of 33\\n98.  Because  he  is  incarcerated  at  a  high  security  facility,  Mr.  Blades  cannot  be \\nconsidered for release to home confinement.  \\n99.  Mr. Blades is seeking a transfer to a medium or low security facility and is seeking \\nrelease to home confinement. \\n100.  Mr. Blades\\u2019 PATTERN score is also higher than similarly situated BOP residents, \\nmeaning that Mr. Blades will earn fewer good time credits, not be eligible for home confinement, \\nand be negatively impacted by an incorrect risk recidivism assessment. \\nPlaintiff Antwan Buchanan \\n101.  Antwan Buchanan was sentenced in docket number 2016 CF1 016142 in the \\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia to a term of incarceration to be served in the Bureau of \\nPrisons on December 14, 2018, for violations of D.C. Code provisions.   \\n102.  Following his sentence, the BOP prepared a custody classification form for Mr. \\nBuchanan to determine his security classification score. \\n103.  As part of the BOP\\u2019s determination of Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s security classification score, \\nthe BOP calculated Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s criminal history score. \\n104.  Because Mr. Buchanan was sentenced by the Superior Court for a D.C. Code \\noffense, the BOP applied Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s scoring rule to determine Mr. Buchanan \\nhad 20 criminal history points, which converted to a criminal history score of 10.   \\n105.  Mr. Buchanan was assessed points under Program Statement 5100.08 that he would \\nnot have been assessed under the Sentencing Guidelines. \\n106.  According to Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s presentence report, he has six prior convictions: \\n  20 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 21 of 33\\na.

A 2002 adult conviction for possession of marijuana for which he received a time \\nserved sentence; \\nc.  A 2004 adult conviction for one count of operating a vehicle with a suspended \\nlicense and one count of operating an unregistered vehicle for which he received a \\nsuspended sentence of 90 days of incarceration; \\nd.

Mr. Buchanan received one point for his 2002 adult conviction for possession of \\nmarijuana (conviction (b) in paragraph 106) pursuant to subsection (c) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal \\nhistory scoring rule: \\u201cAdd 1 point for each prior conviction not counted,\\u201d PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n110.  Mr. Buchanan received one point each for the two counts of his 2004 conviction \\n(conviction (c) in paragraph 106) pursuant to subsection (c) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring \\nrule. \\n111.  Mr. Buchanan received a total of five points for his 2006 conviction (conviction (d) \\nin paragraph 106): one point for the simple assault (because he received 45 days imprisonment), \\nand two points each for the possession of a controlled substance counts (because he received 60 \\ndays imprisonment each), pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring \\nrule. \\n112.  Mr. Buchanan received a total of six points for his 2008 conviction (conviction (e) \\nin paragraph 106): three points for the aggravated assault and three points for the carrying a \\ndangerous weapon counts (because he received more than one year and one month in prison for \\neach count), pursuant to subsection (a) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule.  \\n113.  Mr. Buchanan might have received an extra point for his 2014 possession with \\nintent to distribute marijuana (conviction (e) in paragraph 106) pursuant to subsection (c) of the \\nBOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule even though he had already reached the total of 4 points that \\ncan be awarded under subsection (c), see PS 5100.08 at 33 (\\u201cAdd 1 point for each prior conviction \\nnot counted * * * up to a total of 4 points for this item\\u201d). \\n114.  Mr. Buchanan received two points because he was under supervision at the time of \\nthe instant offense pursuant to subsection (d) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule, PS \\n5100.08 at 34. \\n  22 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 23 of 33\\n115.  Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s score under Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring \\nrule should have been 19 criminal history points, but the BOP incorrectly calculated and awarded \\nMr. Buchanan 20 criminal history points. \\n116.  Had Mr. Buchanan been scored under the Sentencing Guidelines, he would only \\nreceive 12 criminal history points, which converts to a criminal history score of 8. \\na.  Mr.  Buchanan  would  have  received  three  points  for  his  1992  conviction  for \\npossessing a firearm during a violent offense because he was \\u201cincarcerated during \\nany part of\\u201d the 15-year period before his instant offense.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(1). \\nb.  Mr. Buchanan would have received only two points for his 2006 conviction for one \\ncount of simple assault and two counts of possession of a controlled substance \\nbecause they are part of a single sentence that resulted in a sentence of incarceration \\nof 60 days, see USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). \\nc.  Mr. Buchanan would have received four points for his 2008 conviction for one \\ncount of aggravated assault and one count of carrying a dangerous weapon \\u2014 three \\npoints for the carrying a dangerous weapon count, because that count resulted in a \\nsentence of incarceration over one year and one month, see USSG \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(a), \\n4A1.2(e)(2), and one point for the aggravated assault under the catch-all provision \\nthat \\u201c[a]dd[s] one point for each prior sentence resulting from a conviction of a \\ncrime of violence that did not [already] receive any points * * * because such \\nsentence was treated as a single sentence,\\u201d USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(e). \\nd.  Mr. Buchanan would have received one point for his 2014 conviction for possession \\nwith intent to distribute marijuana.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(c). \\n  23 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 24 of 33\\ne.  Mr. Buchanan would have received two points for committing the instant offense \\nwhile under supervision.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(e). \\n117.  Mr. Buchanan would not receive any points under the Sentencing Guidelines for \\nhis 2002 conviction for possession of marijuana because it is outside the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 \\n10-year look-back period.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). \\n118.  Mr. Buchanan would not receive any points under the Sentencing Guidelines for \\nhis 2004 convictions for one count of operating a vehicle with a suspended license and one count \\nof  operating  an  unregistered  vehicle  because  those  convictions  are  outside  the  Sentencing \\nGuidelines\\u2019 ten-year look-back period, see USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). \\n119.  Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s criminal history score is unjustifiably higher than what it would be \\nif he were scored under the Sentencing Guidelines and has contributed to his incarceration in a \\nhigh security USP.   \\n120.  As  a  result  of  his  incarceration  in  a  high  security  facility,  Mr.  Buchanan  is \\nstigmatized and treated worse than identically situated incarcerated people solely because of the \\ncourt in which he was convicted. \\n121.  Mr.  Buchanan  has  significantly  less  access  to  educational  and  vocational \\nprogramming at a high security facility compared to people incarcerated at lower security facility.  \\n122.  Mr. Buchanan has sought to enroll in a forklift operation course at his high security \\nfacility, but one is not available at that facility while it is available at medium and low security \\nfacilities.  \\n123.  Mr. Buchanan is unable to earn as much money at his prison job in his high security \\nfacility than he would be if he were held at a medium or low security facility. \\n  24 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 25 of 33\\n124.  Mr. Buchanan has fewer opportunities to speak to his family and loved ones at his \\nhigh security facility than residents at medium or low security facilities have to speak to their \\nfamilies and loved ones. \\n125.  Mr. Buchanan has fewer opportunities to leave his cell and to breathe fresh air \\noutside than residents at medium or low security facilities.  \\n126.  Mr. Buchanan is unable to practice his religion to the same extent as residents at a \\nmedium or low security facility are able to practice the same religion, in part because high security \\nfacilities  have  fewer  chaplains  and  fewer  religious  resources  than  medium  or  low  security \\nfacilities.  \\n127.  Mr. Buchanan is seeking transfer to a medium or low security facility and release \\nto home confinement.  \\n128.  Mr.  Buchanan\\u2019s  PATTERN  score is  also  higher  than  similarly  situated  BOP \\nresidents, meaning that Mr. Buchanan will earn fewer good time credits and serve a longer prison \\nsentence  than  residents  whose  criminal  history  scores  are  calculated  under  the  Sentencing \\nGuidelines. \\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \\n129.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), Jonathan Blades \\nand Antwan Buchanan bring this action as a class consisting of all people who are or will be \\nconvicted of District of Columbia code offenses who were sentenced from the Superior Court of \\nthe District of Columbia and who are held in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. \\n130.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend the class definition or to establish sub-classes \\nas appropriate if discovery or further investigation reveals that the class should be expanded  \\n  25 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 26 of 33\\n131.  Numerosity: The class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable.  While the \\nprecise size of the class is unknown and is constantly changing, Plaintiffs believe that roughly \\n3,500 people currently fit the class definition, although the composition of the class changes daily.   \\n132.  Joinder of these thousands of people is impractical because the number of unnamed, \\nfuture class members who will be subject to the challenged policy is unknown and unknowable.   \\n133.  Proposed class members are highly unlikely to file individual suits on their own \\nbehalf given the practical, legal, and monetary difficulties that prevent incarcerated people serving \\nsentences in the BOP from accessing independent counsel. \\n134.  Commonality: The claims of the class share common issues of law, including but \\nnot limited to whether the challenged policy violates the APA and the Fifth Amendment. \\n135.  Typicality: The claims of Jonathan Blades and Antwan Buchanan are typical of \\nthose of the class as a whole because their criminal history points were assessed under the \\nchallenged policy and they would receive lower criminal history points, a lower criminal history \\nscore, and lower security point score, if they were scored the same as similarly situated BOP \\nresidents who were sentenced by a federal district court. \\n136.  Adequacy: Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives who meet all requirements \\nof Rule 23(a)(4).  They have no conflict of interest with other class members and will fairly and \\nadequately protect the interests of the class. \\n137.  Plaintiffs\\u2019 counsel will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class, and counsel \\nhave experience with the factual and legal issues litigated in this case, as well as with representing \\nplaintiffs in federal civil rights class actions.  \\n138.  Defendant has acted and will act on grounds generally applicable to the class, \\nthereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a whole.  This is \\n  26 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 27 of 33\\nbecause Defendant\\u2019s actions were taken pursuant to a policy and practice of the BOP.  A permanent \\ninjunction of the policy will therefore benefit all class members. \\nCAUSES OF ACTION \\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTION IN VIOLATION OF THE \\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\n \\n139.  The APA requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful and set aside agency \\naction\\u201d that is \\u201carbitrary,\\u201d \\u201ccapricious,\\u201d or \\u201can abuse of discretion.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(A).   \\n140.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is an \\u201cagency\\u201d under the APA.  5 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 551(1). \\n141.  The  BOP\\u2019s  criminal  history  scoring  scheme,  set  forth  in  Program  Statement \\n5100.08, is final agency action that is reviewable under the APA because it represents the end of \\nthe agency\\u2019s decisionmaking process and creates legal consequences, namely, the increased \\nlikelihood  of  more  restrictions  on  liberty,  unconstitutionally  disparate  treatment  and \\nstigmatization, and other harmful effects on Plaintiffs and proposed class members. \\n142.  Program  Statement  5100.08\\u2019s  criminal  history  scoring  rule  for  individuals \\nsentenced by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse \\nof discretion because the BOP failed to consider significant disparities between its scheme and the \\nU.S. Sentencing Guideline\\u2019s scoring rules for individuals with federal sentences.  The BOP also \\nfailed to consider how these differences result in systematically higher criminal history scores and \\nsecurity  point  scores  for  individuals  with  D.C.  sentences,  which  contributes  to  their \\ndisproportionate placement in higher security facilities. \\n143.  The BOP also failed to consider the discriminatory racial impacts of such a policy \\nas the overwhelming majority of individuals sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court are Black, and \\n  27 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 28 of 33\\nthe BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule contributes to these individuals having higher criminal \\nhistory scores, higher security classifications, and more restrictive housing placements.   \\n144.  Defendants\\u2019 decision, in the challenged policy, to treat Plaintiffs and proposed class \\nmembers more harshly than their federal counterparts is arbitrary and capricious. \\n145.  Defendants\\u2019 policy causes Plaintiffs and proposed class members injuries because \\nit subjects them to unconstitutional and discriminatory treatment, unduly restricts their liberty, \\ndenies them programming opportunities, and subjects them to institutions with greater incidents \\nof violence.   \\n146.  The challenged policy violates the APA because it is arbitrary and capricious and \\nit therefore must be set aside. \\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nACTION CONTRARY TO LAW, IN VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE \\nPROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\n \\n147.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful \\nand set aside agency action\\u201d that is \\u201cotherwise not in accordance with law.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(A).   \\n148.  The BOP\\u2019s Criminal History Score policy violates the APA because it is \\u201cnot in \\naccordance with law\\u201d\\u2014in this case, the BOP\\u2019s own regulation that it \\u201cshall not discriminate \\nagainst inmates on the basis of race * * * [in] the making of administrative decisions and providing \\naccess to work, housing and programs.\\u201d 28 C.F.R. \\u00a7 551.90. \\n149.  The overwhelming number of individuals sentenced by D.C. Superior Court \\u2014 \\nover 95 percent \\u2014 are Black.  The BOP closely maintains statistics on the race of its residents and \\nis aware that policies affecting individuals with D.C. sentences would impact a majority Black \\npopulation.  Therefore, Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule \\u2014 which \\nresults in higher criminal history scores and more restrictive housing \\u2014 disproportionately affects \\n  28 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 29 of 33\\nBlack residents in BOP\\u2019s custody as compared to its majority-white federal population, in violation \\nof the BOP\\u2019s own anti-discrimination housing regulations. \\n150.  Because Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule violates the \\nBOP\\u2019s own regulation, it violates the APA\\u2019s lawfulness requirement and must be set aside. \\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nACTION CONTRARY TO CONSTITUITONAL RIGHT, IN VIOLATION OF THE \\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\n \\n151.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful \\nand  set  aside  agency  action\\u201d  that  is  \\u201ccontrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or \\nimmunity.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(B).   \\n152.  The BOP\\u2019s Criminal History Score policy violates the APA because it is \\u201ccontrary \\nto constitutional right\\u201d\\u2014in this case, the Fifth Amendment\\u2019s right to equal protection.   This claim \\nincorporates all of the points raised with regards to the Constitutional claim, see infra \\u00b6\\u00b6 154\\u2013160.   \\n153.  Because Program Statement 5100.08 violates the Fifth Amendment, it also runs \\nafoul of the APA\\u2019s requirement that rules not conflict with constitutional rights and privileges. \\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE \\nFIFTH AMENDMENT \\n \\n154.  The Fifth Amendment precludes the federal government from treating similarly \\nsituated parties differently for no rational reason.  See 3883 Connecticut LLC v. District of \\nColumbia, 336 F.3d 1068, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Fraternal Order of Police v. United States, 152 \\nF.3d 998, 1002 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (\\u201cEqual protection analysis is substantially identical under the \\nFifth Amendment and the Fourteenth.\\u201d), reh\\u2019g granted on other grounds, 173 F.3d 898 (D.C. Cir. \\n1999). \\n  29 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 30 of 33\\n155.  Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members,  who  were  sentenced  to  a  term  of \\nimprisonment by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, are similarly situated to other \\nBOP residents who were sentenced to a term of imprisonment by any of the federal district courts.  \\nBy law, individuals \\u201csentenced pursuant to the D.C. Code * * * shall be subject to any law or \\nregulation applicable to persons committed for violations of laws of the United States * * * and \\nthe Bureau of Prisons shall be responsible for [their] custody[.]\\u201d  D.C. Code \\u00a7 24-101.  Therefore, \\npursuant to District of Columbia law, individuals sentenced by the Superior Court are intended to \\nbe \\u201csubject\\u201d to the same treatment as individuals sentenced by any of the federal district courts \\nand the BOP is charged with their custody and equal treatment. \\n156.  There is no rational basis to treat Plaintiffs and proposed class members differently \\nthan BOP residents sentenced by federal district courts with regards to housing, programming \\nopportunities, and eligibility for home confinement.   \\n157.  Defendants\\u2019  policy  violates  the  Fifth  Amendment  because  it  treats  similarly \\nsituated parties disparately without a rational basis to do so.   \\n158.  The BOP acted without rational basis and contrary to equal protection principles \\nwhen it implemented a policy that significantly and disparately impacted the 95 percent Black \\npopulation of individuals with D.C. sentences.  By subjecting the majority Black population of \\nindividuals with D.C. sentences to a harsher criminal history scoring system, these individuals \\nhave systematically higher criminal history scores, higher security classifications, and more \\nrestrictive housing placements, than their majority-white federal counterparts.   \\n159.  Because of Defendants\\u2019 policy, Plaintiff and proposed class are more likely to be \\ndesignated to higher security level facilities with more rigorous constraints on their liberty, less \\n  30 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 31 of 33\\naccess to programming and work opportunities, less access to religious services, and more \\nviolence.  \\n160.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants\\u2019 conduct, Plaintiff and the proposed \\nclass have suffered and will continue to suffer harm that is irreparable because the BOP\\u2019s criminal \\nhistory scoring rule is controlling and Plaintiff and the proposed class are unable to challenge their \\ncriminal history score, security classification, or facility designation in court. \\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nACTION WITHOUT OBSERVANCE OF PROCEDURE REQUIRED BY LAW IN \\nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\n \\n161.  The APA requires the reviewing court \\u201cto hold unlawful and set aside\\u201d agency \\naction promulgated \\u201cwithout observance of procedure required by law.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(D). \\n162.  The APA requires that legislative rules undergo a notice and comment period as \\npart of the rulemaking process.  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 553. \\n163.  The Defendants\\u2019 criminal history scoring rule (Program Statement 5100.08) is a \\nbinding,  legislative  rule  that  has  the  force  and  effect  of  law  because  it  provides  concrete, \\ncontrolling, singular guidance for calculating criminal history score, which has a direct and \\nsignificant impact on security classifications and places of imprisonment.   \\n164.  Defendants did not undergo a notice and comment period when adopting Program \\nStatement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule, and thus, the public, key stakeholders, including \\nfederal and D.C. agencies involved in criminal justice work, and those subject to the rule, could \\nnot participate or comment on the rule or its wide-ranging effects. \\n165.  The challenged policy violates the APA and must be set aside because the BOP did \\nnot observe the required notice and comment process before adopting the policy.   \\n \\n  31 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 32 of 33\\nRELIEF REQUESTED \\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \\na.  Declare that the criminal history scoring rule for individuals with D.C. sentences \\npresented in Program Statement 5100.08, ch. 4, \\u00a7 8, is: \\n\\u2022  An arbitrary and capricious action, in violation of the Administrative Procedure \\nAct, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\n\\u2022  An action not in accordance with the law, in violation of the Administrative \\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\n\\u2022  An  action  not  in  accordance  with  the  Constitution,  in  violation  of  the \\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\n\\u2022  An action promulgated without observance of procedure required by law, in \\nviolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; and \\n\\u2022  Unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \\nb.  Vacate and set aside the separate criminal history scoring rule set forth in Program \\nStatement 5100.08, ch. 4, \\u00a7 8; \\nc.  Grant a preliminary injunction and permanent injunction preventing Defendant, its \\nsubordinates, agents, and employees from assessing the criminal history score of \\nindividuals sentenced by D.C.

The district court held that conditions in the\\nOklahoma prison system violated the Eighth Amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. The\\n[1]\\nsubsequent history of the controversy is detailed in the opinions cited in the margin.\\nIn April, 1982, the district court entered an order that defendants \\\"should have and do hereby have the authority\\nindefinitely but not permanently to double-cell where necessary,\\\" 708 F.2d 1523 at 1526, following increases in\\nthe Oklahoma prison population. In October, 1982, the district court issued an opinion following an evidentiary\\nhearing on its orders that had previously been entered. The court stated that although it would not conclude from\\nthe evidence that the system had become unconstitutional in its operation, it was clearly in a state of decline. 708\\n1423 F.2d at 1539. The court continued jurisdiction over the case to insure that the Oklahoma prison system did *1423\\nnot revert to an unconstitutional condition. Id. The court ordered that a statement of penal policy and detailed plan\\nof action be filed.\\nThis court affirmed, one judge dissenting. Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d 1523 (10th Cir.1983),cert. dismissed,465\\nU.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1019, 79 L.Ed.2d 248 (1984). The majority of the panel held that the district court did not\\nabuse its discretion in continuing its jurisdiction to assure compliance with past decrees and to prevent a\\nrecurrence of unconstitutional conditions despite its finding that the system was then currently constitutional. Id.\\nat 1537-40.\\nThe instant controversy concerns events following that decision. In compliance with the district court's order, the\\nState filed a detailed \\\"Plan of Measures to be Taken to Assure Continued Constitutionality of Oklahoma's Prisons\\\"\\nin June, 1983, and in July the State filed a supplement to the Plan. In September, 1983, the court held an\\nevidentiary hearing on the State's Plan and the State's motion to dismiss the case. Judge Bohanon recused in\\nDecember, 1983, and the case was assigned to Chief Judge Seay. Following review of a portion of the record, he\\nentered the order on appeal herein on December 30.\\n\\nThe court concluded that \\\"since October 1982 to the present date the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma\\nprison system are constitutional and are not cruel and unusual punishment.\\\" X Jt.App. 237. The court noted that\\nthere had been \\\"disturbances, problems, and inadequacies in the Oklahoma prison system since the court's last\\nfindings.\\\" Id. at 235. The court noted that there were four subjects of previous court orders still found to be\\ninadequate and not in compliance 00 racial integration, access to the courts, equal protection guarantees for\\n97\\nwomen, and vacating for human habitation the East and West Cellhouses of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\nMcAlester. Id.\\nThe court concluded nevertheless that the system was constitutional and \\\"each area of continued violation has\\nbeen specifically addressed by the State and is subject to a specifically planned remedy.\\\" Id. The court found that\\nthe State legislature and prison officials were aware of and sensitive to the constitutional requirements and that\\nthe court was satisfied \\\"that there is no reasonable expectation that unconstitutional practices will recur in the\\nconditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system.\\\" Id. at 238. Concluding that it was mindful of its\\nobligation to enforce the constitutional rights of all persons, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the\\ncase in its entirety. However, the court concluded that \\\"[a]ll of this court's orders and injunctions as modified\\nheretofore remain in full force and effect.\\\" Id. at 239.\\nIn May, 1984, the district court denied a motion by plaintiffs to stay the dismissal order. Responding to a\\ncomplaint that the judge had not had the full record to review, the judge noted that he had had four of seven\\ntranscripts from the September hearing for review before entering the order; that he had all the transcripts\\ncontaining plaintiffs' case-in-chief; and that he had earlier had the transcript volume with the testimony of the\\nGovernor and the Director of the Corrections Department. In denying the request for a stay, the court concluded\\nthat \\\"[a]fter a careful review and study of the entire transcript, the court finds no reason to change its order of\\nDecember 30, 1983, and the court reaffirms that order.\\\" Id. at 248. The court stated that \\\"[a]lthough the court\\nnoted problems of compliance in certain areas, those areas were not held to be constitutional violations.\\\" Id.\\n(emphasis in original).\\nOn April 25, 1984, a panel of this court denied an application by the plaintiffs for a stay of the dismissal order,\\npending appeal. On May 25, 1985, plaintiffs filed a further motion for a stay of the dismissal order, pending\\nappeal, contending that the State was housing inmates in the East and West Cellhouses in violation of the district\\ncourt's order of May, 1979. The State responded that the inmates were temporarily housed in those cellhouses\\n1424 on May 13, 1985, as a result of a disturbance at another *1424 State prison, and that the inmates were removed\\nfrom them on May 28. Plaintiffs did not dispute these facts but did request that this court stay the dismissal order\\nnevertheless. We denied the renewed application for a stay, stating that we would \\\"consider the propriety and\\nscope of the district court's December 30, 1983, order in our disposition of the pending appeal in this cause.\\\" A\\nmotion to reconsider that ruling was filed, but in view of our disposition of the case the motion becomes moot.\\nWe turn now to the appellate arguments challenging the correctness of the district court's order of dismissal.\\nII\\nPlaintiffs challenge the district court's holding that the prison system is constitutional. They argue that the system\\nis unconstitutional with respect to access to the courts, racial integration, and equal protection guarantees for\\nwomen 00 areas that the district court found to be \\\"inadequate and not in compliance\\\" with previous court orders.\\n97\\nPlaintiffs also contend that the Oklahoma prison system, considering the totality of the circumstances, is in\\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.\\nA.\\n\\nAccess to the courts\\n[2]\\nPlaintiffs attack the defendants' reliance on inmate law clerks to provide meaningful access to the courts.

We have previously noted, however, that \\\"[u]nder Bounds,\\nthe State is free to make a choice between affording law library facilities on a reasonable basis, or the alternative\\nmeans of having available counsel on a reasonable basis.\\\" Ward v. Kort, 762 F.2d 856, 860 (10th Cir.1985). The\\ndistrict court's dismissal order stated:\\nThe court finds that the mandated minimums of adequate library facilities has not yet been met. \\nBounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 [97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72] (1976). However, testimony from\\nMr. Larry Meachum, Director of the Department of Corrections of Oklahoma, at the September\\n1983 hearing, indicates and assures this court that libraries will be fully stocked and that plaintiffs\\nhave and will be assured continued access to courts.\\nX Jt.App. 235. In this connection, the defendants' Plan stated that the State intended \\\"to continue their current\\napproach to access to courts by providing both law libraries and trained inmate law clerks to assist inmates in\\nframing legal issues for presentation to the court.\\\" X R. 113; see id. at 113-14.\\nThere is record evidence that the Department of Corrections has a large or small library at each of the prison\\nfacilities. Inventories were admitted in evidence as Defendants' Exhibits 29, 30, and 31 respecting the major law\\nlibraries at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center, and the Joseph Harp\\nCorrectional Center. V Jt.App. 1041. Each library has a supervisor. The fact finder appointed by the district court\\nhad found an \\\"appalling lack of essential legal books and reference materials at both major and minor law\\nlibraries.\\\" VIII Jt.App. 119. However, we note that the inventories do list a substantial volume of basic materials in\\nthe libraries. See, e.g., Defendants' Exhibit 29 (containing extensive listing of law books at Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary Library). Further, defendants' Plan represented to the court that \\\"the Department is continually\\n[3]\\nupdating and supplementing its law library inventories.\\\" X Jt.App. 114.\\n1425 *1425 In light of the testimony, the documentary evidence, and the representations accepted by the district court,\\nwe hold that the finding of the court that there was no constitutional violation in this respect is not in error.\\nB.\\nThe claim of racial discrimination\\nEarlier practices of racial discrimination in the Oklahoma prison system were chronicled in Battle v. Anderson,\\n376 F.Supp. at 410-11. In that opinion, the district court made conclusions of law on these practices, id. at\\n420-21, and entered orders designed to remedy the discrimination. Id. at 428-30. The State has endeavored\\nsince those orders to comply with the constitutional requirements.\\nIn the instant proceeding there are numerous allegations of racial discrimination and segregation in the\\nOklahoma prison system, including discrimination in job assignments, dining hall seating, and cell assignments.\\nNumerous examples are contained in the fact finder's March 1983 final compliance report, VIII Jt.App. 25-43, and\\nin the arguments and record citations in the briefs of the plaintiffs-appellants in this phase of the controversy.\\nBrief of Appellants 15-16, 43; Reply Brief of Appellants 12-14. The State and the United States as intervenor\\nargue that the evidence supports a finding of nondiscrimination. Brief of State Defendants-Appellees 101-02;\\nBrief for the United States as Appellee 26-28.\\nIn addition, the plaintiffs-appellants argue that the trial court did not address these issues in the December 30,\\n1983 order of dismissal. In that regard, we note that the district court did make the following findings and\\nconclusions respecting this claim of racial discrimination:\\n\\nRacial integration of the occupants of double cells is found to be almost non-existent in the\\nOklahoma prison system. Racial integration of cells is strictly by voluntary action only. However, a\\ncommitment by defendants to fully integrate is contained in the Defendants' Plan. The court finds\\nthe Defendants' Plan to be of sufficient remedial effect and has previously, in this order, approved\\nand ordered its adoption.\\nX Jt.App. 235.\\nIn view of the findings quoted above, we cannot agree with the plaintiffs-appellants that the trial court did not\\naddress the racial discrimination claim at all. Nevertheless, because of the several distinct questions clearly\\nraised by the fact finder's findings and the specific issues joined by the parties, we must agree that the findings of\\nthe district court are not sufficient under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. We cannot perform our appellate function\\nwithout adequate findings and conclusions by the trial court on this issue of fundamental constitutional\\nimportance. Battle v. Anderson, 614 F.2d 251, 256 (10th Cir.1980); Squirtco v. Seven-Up Co., 628 F.2d 1086,\\n1902 (8th Cir.1980). Without expressing any view on the validity of the constitutional claim of racial discrimination,\\nwe hold that the findings and conclusions thereon are not sufficient due to the sharp conflict on the several claims\\nof specific discriminatory treatment not addressed by the trial judge.\\nAccordingly, with respect to this claim of racial discrimination, the judgment of dismissal must be vacated and the\\ncase remanded on that claim for such further proceedings as the district court deems proper. In view of the\\nintervening time lapse it may well be desirable that further evidence on this claim be received. After the further\\nproceedings which the trial court finds proper are held, the district judge should then find the facts specially and\\nstate separately his conclusions thereon in detail, dealing with the various claims of racial discrimination in\\naccordance with Rule 52(a).\\nC.\\nThe claim of sex discrimination\\n1426 Under the Equal Protection Clause, the plaintiffs-appellants argue vigorously *1426 that women inmates in the\\nOklahoma prison system are subjected to discrimination in conditions of confinement, job assignments, training\\nprograms, mental and medical health services, and recreation. These were objections made by the plaintiffs to\\ndeficiencies in the fact finder's final compliance report. X Jt.App. 58-61. The specific claims arise from the fact\\nthat the State in a stipulation had agreed not to discriminate against inmates on various grounds, including sex,\\nand had agreed further to provide equal access to various programs and work assignments. Brief of Appellants\\n22; Brief for the United States as Appellee 30 n. 22.\\nThe district court's order of dismissal contains the following discussion of this issue:\\nThe court finds that equal protection guarantees for women inmates are inadequate in terms of\\nprograms, medical care, and exercise. However, Director Meachum testified there is a $62,000.00\\ncurrent special appropriation for women's programs and detailed the specific remedies outlined in\\nthe Defendants' Plan. The court finds the proposed measures will continue constitutionality.\\nX Jt.App. 236.\\nWith respect to the claim of violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the treatment of women inmates, we feel\\nthat the findings are not inadequate. The trial court specifically found inadequacies in terms of programs, medical\\ncare, and exercise. We feel that the remaining claims of inadequate housing were thus implicitly rejected.\\nFurthermore, the trial judge specifically identified the testimony which he credited, that of Director Meachum. His\\ntestimony concerning a $62,000 current special appropriation for women's programs was identified. Moreover,\\nthe court concluded that the program laid out by Director Meachum would be constitutionally sufficient. We note\\nthat Director Meachum's testimony explained the reason for not having an intermediate health unit for the Mabel\\n\\nBassett facility in the Oklahoma City area. He pointed out that they had a psychiatrist assigned to the Mabel\\nBassett facility addressing the mental health needs of women. VII Jt.App. 95-97.\\nOn consideration of the evidence relied on by the plaintiffs, the evidence cited by the trial judge, and the resolve\\nshown in the testimony of Director Meachum to solve the problem, we cannot say that the findings and\\nconclusions of the trial judge on this constitutional claim were in error.\\nD.\\nThe Eighth Amendment claim\\nPlaintiffs further vigorously challenge the findings and conclusions of the district court which rejected their claim\\nthat the totality of the circumstances in the Oklahoma prison system amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in\\nviolation of the prohibition of the Eighth Amendment. More specifically, they seriously complain about\\novercrowding, food and kitchen facilities, ventilation, educational and training programs, medical and mental\\nhealth services, and the occupation temporarily of the East and West Cellhouses at the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary in violation of the May 4, 1979 order of Judge Bohanon.\\nIn connection with this constitutional claim and the detailed complaints made, the district court's findings and\\nconclusions against the plaintiffs were as follows:\\n[T]he court finds that management problems exist in the Oklahoma system. Problem areas can be\\ndetermined in food preparation and service, maintenance of equipment and facilities, distribution\\nof clothing and essential supplies, and inmate idleness. These management problems exist\\ndespite the extremely professional staff of the Oklahoma prison system. These problems are\\nfound to be primarily a direct result of increases in prison population.\\nUnfortunately, there will always be problems and inadequacies. We are considering a large,\\nconfined population of convicted felons, not a nursery school. As noted by Judge Barrett, \\\"The \\n1427 Rhodes majority observed that harsh or restrictive *1427 conditions of confinement are part of the\\npunishment criminal offenders justly receive because the Constitution does not mandate\\ncomfortable prisons. Justice Powell wrote that `To the extent that such conditions [of confinement]\\nare restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their\\noffenses against society.' 452 U.S. [337] at p. 347 [101 S.Ct. 2392 at p. 2399, 69 L.Ed.2d 59].\\\" \\nBattle v. Anderson, supra at page 1535.\\nThe court finds, considering the totality of circumstances, these inadequacies, problems, and\\nshortcomings do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the test of Rhodes. Rhodes v.\\nChapman, supra at page 347 [101 S.Ct. at page 2399]. The court finds no evidence at this time to\\nshow that the plaintiffs' present conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system have\\nchanged from one of constitutionality to unconstitutionality. Thus, the court finds that since\\nOctober 1982 to the present date the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system\\nare constitutional and are not cruel and unusual punishment.\\nX Jt.App. 236-37.\\nFor reasons we will outline generally, from our review of the record testimony and exhibits, and from the\\narguments about the record evidence by plaintiffs, we conclude that the district court's findings were not clearly\\nerroneous, that the conclusions drawn were supported by the findings and record, and that the determination of\\nthe court to dismiss the cause in its entirety, retaining in full force and effect the prior orders and injunctions\\nagainst constitutional violations, was not in error.\\nWe have noted that there are specific complaints concerning conditions of confinement, including overcrowding,\\nfood and kitchen facilities, ventilation, educational and training programs, medical and mental health services,\\nand the temporary occupancy of the East and West Cellhouses. See Brief of Appellants 4-22, 30-36. However,\\n\\nthe ban on cruel and unusual punishment prohibits conditions that \\\"involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction\\nof pain, [or are] grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment.\\\" Rhodes v.\\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2399, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); see Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312,\\n___-___, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 1082-86, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). Although prison inmates may not be deprived of the\\n\\\"minimal civilized measure of life's necessities,.. conditions that cannot be said to be cruel and unusual under\\ncontemporary standards are not unconstitutional. To the extent that such conditions are restrictive and even\\nharsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.\\\" Rhodes v.\\nChapman, 452 U.S. at 347, 101 S.Ct. at 2399.\\nA little over two years ago a panel of this court agreed that the overall conditions of the Oklahoma prison system\\nat that time were constitutional. Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d at 1533, 1537. We have considered the plaintiffs'\\ncomplaints and the arguments in their briefs concerning the evidence in this subsequent case and are not\\nconvinced that the findings of the district court are clearly erroneous. The State defendants and the intervenor\\nUnited States have persuasively argued that the evidence of record does not demonstrate conditions of\\nconfinement constituting cruel and unusual punishment under the strict standard of Rhodes v. Chapman. See\\n[4]\\nBrief of Defendants-Appellees 2-88; Brief for the United States as Appellee 15-23.\\n1428 *1428 We note one item in particular, the complaint that facilities at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary were not air-\\nconditioned. The complaint concerning the heat was covered by the testimony of Mr. Hutto. The testimony was\\nthat the new housing units at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary were air-conditioned. IV Jt.App. 597. The East and\\nWest Cellhouses were not air-conditioned, but as discussed below, they were vacated, except for limited\\nemergency use, in compliance with the orders of Judge Bohanon.\\nWith respect to the East and West Cellhouses, the May 4, 1979 order of Judge Bohanon was that the State no\\nlonger house inmates at those East and West Cellhouses due to the inadequate facilities there. In the dismissal\\norder of December 30, 1983, the district court noted that the State was not in compliance with that order, but was\\nsatisfied from the assurances of Director Meachum and Governor Nigh that the cellhouses would be vacated as\\nsoon as feasible. X Jt.App. 236.\\nOn May 25, 1985, plaintiffs filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in this court stating that inmates were being\\nhoused in the East and West Cellhouses in violation of the May 4, 1979 order. The State responded to that\\nmotion, representing that the inmates were placed in the cellhouses on May 13, 1985, as the result of a\\ndisturbance at another state prison and that the inmates were removed from these East and West Cellhouses on\\nMay 28. Plaintiffs did not challenge these representations.\\nThere was a further motion for a stay filed December 27, 1985, in which the plaintiffs again represented that\\nsome inmates had been placed into the East and West Cellhouses. However, this was again related to a riot\\nproblem and the defendants informed the plaintiffs' counsel that the forty-three inmates housed in the East\\nCellhouse following the riot were all removed by January 6, 1986. See Response of the United States to\\nAppellants' Motion to Reconsider Order Denying Stay Pending Appeal 3. There was no dispute of those facts\\nconcerning the removal of the inmates from the East Cellhouse after the problem of temporary occupancy. We\\ntherefore conclude that the complaint concerning the East and West Cellhouses is not supported in our record,\\nand we are not persuaded that these temporary emergency uses of the cellhouses should be held a\\nconstitutional violation.\\nIn sum, we are not persuaded by the arguments of the plaintiffs and the evidence that the findings of the district\\ncourt that there was no violation of the Eighth Amendment were clearly erroneous. In addition, we are not\\nconvinced that there was an abuse of discretion by the district court in determining to dismiss the cause as he\\n[5]\\ndid, retaining in force and effect the prior orders and injunctions against constitutional violations.  The majority\\nin Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d at 1537, concluded that \\\"a court should exercise supervisory power over the suit\\nuntil it can say with assurance not only that eighth amendment violations do not presently exist but there is no\\nreasonable expectation that unconstitutional conditions will recur.\\\" In dealing with the various issues before him,\\nthe district judge concluded that he was satisfied that the defendants intended permanent compliance with\\nconstitutional conditions in the Oklahoma prison system. X Jt.App. 232, 234-37. The Memorandum Opinion and\\n\\n1429 Order *1429 stated that \\\"this court finds that it is now satisfied that there is no reasonable expectation that\\nunconstitutional practices will recur in the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system.\\\" Id. at 238.\\nWe are convinced that the district court's conclusion was based on findings supported by the record and that the\\ndetermination to dismiss in these circumstances was not in error or an abuse of discretion.\\nIII\\nAs noted, there was a motion for a stay of the district court's dismissal order filed on May 25, 1985, by the\\nplaintiffs. This court denied that motion, as noted, stating that we would consider the propriety and scope of the\\ndistrict court's December 30, 1983 order of dismissal in our disposition of the pending appeal. On December 27,\\n1985, the plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider that order denying the May 25, 1985 motion for a stay. Because of\\nthe disposition we are making in this opinion, we find that motion now to be moot.\\nIn addition, on February 4, 1986, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial remand for the district court to make an\\nappropriate award of attorney's fees pendente lite. In view of the fact that this court was proceeding to disposition\\nof the case, we have deferred a ruling on that motion. Since we are making a partial remand of the case, the\\nplaintiffs will have the opportunity to have the district court consider a further application of attorney's fees when\\nthose proceedings on remand occur. The trial judge should entertain any such motion with those proceedings.\\nIV\\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated we make the following determinations and order as follows:\\n1. The order of dismissal of December 30, 1983, by the district court, which retained in full force and effect the\\nprevious orders and injunctions protecting the rights of the plaintiffs against constitutional violations, is\\nAFFIRMED except with respect to the claim of racial discrimination discussed in Part II-B of this opinion. The\\nplaintiffs may by further proceedings in the district court seek relief from any violations of those previous orders\\nand injunctions protecting their constitutional rights.\\n2. The order of dismissal of December 30, 1983, is VACATED with respect to the claim of racial discrimination in\\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; as discussed in Part II-B of this opinion,\\nthe cause is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings and the entry of findings and conclusions by\\nthe district court on that constitutional claim as directed by this opinion.\\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\\n[*] The Honorable William E. Doyle heard the argument in this appeal but did not participate after December 31,\\n1985, in this matter.\\n[1] Since the district court held that conditions in the Oklahoma prison system violated the Eighth Amendment's\\nproscription of cruel and unusual punishment in Battle v. Anderson, 376 F.Supp. 402 (E.D.Okla.1974), the\\nlitigation concerning constitutional compliance has been ongoing. See Battle v. Anderson, 447 F.Supp. 516\\n(E.D.Okla.),aff'd,564 F.2d 388 (10th Cir.1977); Battle v. Anderson, 457 F.Supp. 719 (E.D.Okla.1978),remanded\\nfor further hearings,594 F.2d 786 (10th Cir.1979); Battle v. Anderson, 614 F.2d 251 (10th Cir.1980); Battle v.\\nAnderson, 708 F.2d 1523 (10th Cir.1983) (per curiam), cert. dismissed,465 U.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1019, 79\\nL.Ed.2d 248 (1984); see also Battle v. Anderson, 541 F.Supp. 1061 (E.D.Okla.1982) (award of attorneys' fees).\\n[2] The constitutional right of access to the courts has been found to rest on the guarantees of the Due Process\\nClauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. See Ward v. Kort, 762 F.2d 856, 858 (10th Cir.1985).\\n[3] In addition to the inventories of materials at the libraries, we note that the handbook \\\"Civil Procedure for\\nInmate Legal Research Assistants\\\" itself covered basic principles on federal habeas corpus with chapters on the\\nexhaustion doctrine, procedural default, issues cognizable, pleadings, preliminary procedure, and evidentiary\\n\\nhearings. Statutory materials and summaries on various cases from the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals\\non habeas proceedings were also included.\\n[4] The plaintiffs argue that they were denied due process when Chief Judge Seay entered his order of dismissal\\nafter having received only four of seven transcripts of the hearing held earlier before Judge Bohanon. Judge\\nSeay had before him at the time of his dismissal the transcripts of the plaintiffs' entire case in chief, among other\\nthings, and the testimony of Governor Nigh and Director Meachum, and the exhibits were apparently available,\\nincluding those we have cited earlier concerning access to the courts. In addition, in his ruling a few months later\\non the motion to stay his order, which was denied, the judge stated that he had at that time reviewed the entire\\ntranscript of all the proceedings before Judge Bohanon.\\n[5] As noted, the district court here expressly stated that \\\"[a]ll of this court's orders and injunctions as modified\\nheretofore remain in full force and effect.\\\" X Jt.App. 239. This is in accord with the principle that \\\"[i]t has long\\nbeen settled that the court's power to grant injunctive relief survives discontinuance of the illegal conduct. E.g., \\nUnited States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1952).\\\" Battle v. Anderson,\\n708 F.2d at 1538 n. 4. If the district court had intended any dissolution of the prior orders, its order \\\"should have\\ncontained a definite provision for the dissolution\\\" of those provisions. Tucker v. Baker, 185 F.2d 863, 865 (5th\\nCir.1950). We are convinced that it is unmistakenbly clear that the orders and injunctions protecting the inmates\\nagainst constitutional violations, as previously modified, were in no way intended to be relaxed and that they\\nremain in full force and effect.\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar.\\n\\nDocument Title: Opinion\\nDocument Content: \\n564 F.2d 388 (1977)\\nBobby BATTLE, Plaintiff-Appellee,\\nv.\\nPark J.

The State of Oklahoma, following its filing of its\\nNotice of Appeal, moved this court for a stay of the Order of June 14, 1977, which was granted and is yet in force\\nand effect. The appeal and motion for stay were combined for hearing before this court which was held on August\\n23, 1977. The Stay Order has been continued pending disposition of the appeal on the merits.\\nThe genesis of the District Court's Order of June 14, 1977, is a Motion for Emergency Supplemental Relief filed\\nby plaintiff Bobby Battle wherein he alleged \\\"overcrowding\\\" of the inmate population at the state penitentiary. The\\nchallenged Order was entered following full evidentiary hearing. It contains specific findings, inter alia, relative to\\nthe minimum amount of cell space required per prison inmate and, measured thereby, the District Court specially\\nfound that as of the May 23 hearing the Oklahoma prison system contained about 4,600 inmates in a system\\ndesigned for 2,400, constituting an overcrowding situation of 191 percent. In addition to the overcrowding crisis,\\nthe Court found various and sundry physical and environmental conditions existing throughout the system which\\nwere offensive and substandard. The Court specially found that the overcrowding condition had reached such\\nproportions that it constituted a per se unconstitutional condition violative of the Eighth Amendment commands\\nprohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. The Order and Judgment required the State of Oklahoma to achieve\\nspecific goals in the reduction of inmate population commencing August, 1977, more fully hereinafter set forth.\\nOn appeal, the appellant, State of Oklahoma, alleges error on the part of the District Court in that: (1) the\\nevidence does not support a finding that there is a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States\\nConstitution, (2) appellants were denied a fair hearing, (3) findings of fact were erroneously made because the\\n\\ntrial court was misled and unduly swayed by the consideration of inadmissible exhibits and, further, because the\\nfacts were for the most part unsubstantiated by competent testimony of the witnesses, and (4) the court should\\nhave accepted the State's Plan as consented per agreement reached between the State and the appellees.\\nThe seriousness of this matter is recognized by all parties concerned. This court, just as the trial court, is\\ncognizant of the strain placed upon the federal-state relationship. We echo the consistent emphasis of the District\\nCourt relating to its reluctance to usurp or interfere with an area historically within the domain and control of the\\nsovereign states. It is in this context that we must judge whether, from the record before us, there exists such a\\ncompelling interest in the protection of federal constitutional rights that the Order of the District Court must be\\nupheld. A somewhat detailed recital of the factual-procedural background leading to this opinion should help in\\nplacing this difficult case in proper perspective.\\nThe initial complaint alleged civil rights deprivations under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 challenging the Oklahoma State\\n392 Penitentiary and penal system. It was filed by Bobby *392 Battle, pro se, on April 24, 1972, when he was a\\nprisoner at the penitentiary. He complained on behalf of himself and other inmates that they were deprived of\\nrights secured by the federal constitution and civil rights laws. The action sought injunctive relief to correct the\\nclaimed deprivations and to obtain monetary damages. The defendants were various Oklahoma officials\\nperforming duties relating to the state's penal and correctional institutions and system. Upon motion and hearing,\\nthe United States was permitted to intervene on March 5, 1974. The complaint in intervention filed by the United\\nStates alleged that the defendants (the State of Oklahoma, in effect) had discriminated against black inmates in a\\nnumber of instances. The trial of said cause commenced March 14, 1974, and concluded on March 15th. It had\\nbeen preceded by extensive pre-trial discovery including depositions, inspections and investigations conducted\\nby attorneys, FBI agents and experts in penology. The District Court made extensive findings and conclusions\\nleading to its Order, generally finding for the plaintiffs. The Order directed the defendants to undertake certain\\nremedial steps, granting them adequate opportunity within which to comply. Nothing in that proceeding, however,\\ninvolved the general contention of prison inmate overcrowding, per se. The Court did deal with conditions existing\\nin the \\\"solitary confinement\\\" or \\\"the hole\\\" isolation area of the penitentiary, noting that those confined in such\\ndark, unventilated and unsanitary isolation cells were being subjected to intolerable treatment. The Order also\\nreached and disposed of contentions going to racial discrimination and segregation, disciplinary rules,\\npunishment and procedure, administrative lockup, use of chemical agents, medical care, correspondence rights,\\npublications, access to the courts, and religious freedom. In apparent reliance on the rule that a \\u00a7 1983 civil rights\\naction in Federal District Court is supplemental to any other available remedy, no challenge to the federal court's\\njurisdiction has at any time been raised or urged on the grounds of exhaustion of available state remedies or as a\\nmatter of abstention. At oral arguments before this court, counsel for the State of Oklahoma did state belief that\\nsimilar remedies are available to the inmates under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. It was acknowledged,\\nhowever, that at no time or in anywise was the Federal District Court below moved or requested to invoke\\nabstention or exhaustion of available state remedies. At oral argument, counsel for Bobby Battle, et al.,\\ncontended that there are no remedies available under the laws of Oklahoma comparable to the class action\\nremedies which may be compelled in a \\u00a7 1983 proceeding. In any event, it is clear that the parties have acceded\\nto the District Court's jurisdiction throughout these proceedings.\\nThe District Court expressed the reluctance of federal courts to intervene in matters of prison administration, but\\nobserved that the United States Supreme Court had held that a policy of judicial restraint on the part of the\\nfederal courts in refraining from interference with state penal authorities in their administration of a state's penal\\nsystem was not a justifiable basis for failure to take cognizance of valid federal constitutional claims relating to\\nrights secured to inmates by the federal constitution and the laws of the United States. Procunier v. Martinez, 417\\nU.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263\\n(1972); Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969). The District Court retained\\njurisdiction, including that for \\\"determination of all issues not dealt with expressly herein.\\\" The trial court's\\nmemorandum opinion consumed 30 pages, reported as Battle v. Anderson, 376 F.Supp. 402 (1974).\\nWe, too, abhor any situation or circumstance requiring the intervention of the federal courts in matters involving\\nthe administration, control and maintenance by the sovereign states of their penal systems. It is a delicate role\\nassigned to the federal courts to display that restraint so necessary \\\"in the maintenance of proper federal-state\\n393 relations.\\\" Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). We are *393 cognizant of the\\n\\ncomplexity of problems confronting the states in upgrading not only a host of state institutions and facilities but in\\nproperly maintaining them both physically and with adequate personnel. If we were to close our eyes to the\\nfinancial burdens a variety of \\\"piecemeal\\\" federal court orders would impose upon the states and their taxpayers\\nwe would refuse to come to grips with reality. We are in sympathy with the ever increasing budgetary demands\\nupon state taxpayers. There are constitutional and statutory limits on a state's capacity to finance capital outlays.\\nNo one state governmental body is authorized to dictate a specific course of action. The governmental wheels\\noften turn slowly simply as a result of pressure generated by a multitude of needs. Those charged with the\\nadministration of state government must pick and choose, set priorities and goals, many of which must later be\\nabandoned or delayed because of unforeseen emergencies. Thus, it is in recognition of these problems and\\npressures that this court is sincerely reluctant to enter the arena involving the issues presented. The fact is,\\nhowever, that the issues are jurisdictionally before us, just as they were jurisdictionally before the District Court.\\nThey have not been invited or solicited. We are guided by the fact that the United States Supreme Court has not\\nwavered in its holding that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibiting the imposition of\\ncruel and unusual punishment is, inter alia, intended to protect and safeguard a prison inmate from an\\nenvironment where degeneration is probable and self-improvement unlikely because of the conditions existing\\nwhich inflict needless suffering, whether physical or mental. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50\\nL.Ed.2d 251 (1976); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976).\\nThe District Court made particular reference to a serious riot which occurred at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary\\nin 1973 when it entered its Supplemental Order of June 14, 1977, following Plaintiff's Motion for Supplemental\\nRelief as to Crowding:\\nThe conditions which precipitated and caused the disastrous riot of 1973 at McAlester now prevail\\nthroughout the system. In the hearings conducted by the court in 1974 prior to its May 30, 1974\\nOrder (376 F.Supp. 402) the court heard the shocking details of the conditions existing prior to the\\nriot and became convinced that the neglect, apathy and deliberate disregard for human decency\\nand rights contributed directly to the tragic loss of lives and $20 million in state property damages.\\nIt is now equally convinced that the inmate conditions now existing present an immediate and\\nintolerable threat to the safety and security of inmates, prison personnel and the people of the\\nState of Oklahoma with attendant monetary losses and costs of staggering proportions.\\nIn its 1974 opinion in Battle v. Anderson, supra, the District Court noted that during a period of seven months prior\\nto the 1973 riot at the penitentiary the inmate population at the main facility averaged about 1778; that two of the\\ngeneral population cellhouses were constructed in 1907 and the third and fourth units were added in 1932 and\\n1935, providing a design capacity of 1200 inmates.\\nIn its Memorandum Opinion of June 14, 1977, from which this appeal was generated, the Trial Court observed\\nthat the State of Oklahoma made significant progress in many of the concerned areas included in the original\\norder, while failing to do so in other areas; that since the May 30, 1974, order the court had conducted periodic\\nhearings at approximately six month intervals; and that evidence concerning the problem of overcrowding and\\nconditions of confinement was entertained and presented on May 4, 1976, and October 14-15, 1976, and that\\neven though the Court did not issue any orders at those times, \\\"it clearly indicated to the defendants that the then\\nexisting population levels and conditions were intolerable and that the court was considering the issuance of an\\n394 injunction\\\" and \\\"In the interim the problem kept going.\\\" The court found that as of May 23, *394 1977, the State of\\nOklahoma was housing inmates at seven (7) separate facilities totalling 4,600 in facilities with design capacity not\\nin excess of 2,400. Much of this data was obtained from an exhibit constituting a letter from the Director of the\\nOklahoma Department of Corrections dated March 22, 1977. The court observed that it had deferred since May\\n30, 1974, from entering specific orders in the hope that the commended vigorous leadership of Warden Crisp and\\nDirector Benton would, in effect, move the \\\"powers that be\\\" to correct those abuses, but that the court learned in\\nOctober, 1976, that even though the State Board of Corrections in its FY78 Budget had labeled conditions within\\nthe Department a \\\"shame and disgrace\\\" to the State of Oklahoma, the crisis was still such that the physical and\\nmental health of each inmate was impaired. The court found that each resident living in a cell should have a\\nminimum of 60 square feet of sleeping space and each resident of a dormitory should have 75 square feet, as\\nfound by the State Department of Corrections to be the absolute minimum; that certain facilities then in being\\nwere woefully inadequate, rendering treatment of inmates there imprisoned cruel and unusual. The Trial Court\\n\\nlent considerable credibility to the expert testimony of Theodore James Gordon, an environmental health\\nspecialist, Frederick D. Moyer, an architect, and Charles Robert Sarver, a professor of law and sociology and a\\nformer correctional administrator. The court recited in detail the conditions of confinement at each prison facility, i.\\ne., the McAlester complex, Granite, Lexington, Quachita, McLeod and Stringtown. The Court's Conclusions of\\nLaw and Order and Judgment of June 14, 1977, are as follows:\\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\\n1. The Court has the authority and duty to insure that the Constitution does not stop at the prison\\ngate, but rather inures to the benefit of all, even to those citizens behind prison walls, Jackson v.\\nGodwin, 400 F.2d 529, 532 (5th Cir. 1968),Finney v. Arkansas Board of Education [Correction],\\n505 F.2d 194 (8th Cir. 1974).\\n2. In implementing the Constitution, courts have required that certain penal facilities be closed, \\nRhem v. Malcolm, 371 F.Supp. 594 (S.D.N.Y. 1974)aff'd507 F.2d 333 (2nd Cir. 1974),Gates v.\\nCollier, 390 F.Supp. 482 (N.D.Miss. 1974), and Hamilton v. Landrieu, 351 F.Supp. 549 (E.D.La.\\n1972); that inmates be housed in single cells, instead of multiple inmates in a cell, Inmates of\\nSuffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, 360 F.Supp. 676 (D.Mass. 1973)aff'd,494 F.2d 1196 (1st Cir.\\n1974), and Valvano v. Malcolm, 520 F.2d 392 (2nd Cir. 1975) that prison population be limited to a\\nfixed number, e. g., Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, 406 F.Supp. 649 (S.D.Tex. 1975); or that\\ninmates be afforded a fixed minimum amount square footage (see cases cited at conclusion of law\\n6).\\n3. Courts have also evaluated quality of life in penal facilities and demanded a healthy\\nenvironment with adequate sanitation, ventilation, lighting and utilities, Williams v. Edwards, 547\\nF.2d 120 [1206] (5th Cir. 1977); regarding ventilation Rhem v. Malcolm, supra, Hamilton v. Love,\\n328 F.Supp. 1182 (E.D.Ark. 1971) and Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, supra. Vermin\\ninfestations, Miller v. Carson, 401 F.Supp. 835, (M.D.Fla. 1975) and Hamilton v. Landrieu, supra.\\nSee also Rozechi v. Gaughan, 459 F.2d 6 (1st Cir. 1970) and Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 387\\n(M.D.Ala. 1972)aff'd sub nom. Wyatt v. Aderholt, 523 [503] F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1974).\\n4. Courts have grappled with the problems and the conditions of confinement in three ways.\\nConditions have been found to be per se unconstitutional. E. g., Rhem, supra, conditions as\\nexacerbated by overpopulation have found to be unconstitutional, E. g., Williams v. Edwards,\\nsupra, Finney v. Arkansas Board of Corrections, supra, and Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp. 318\\n(M.D.Ala. 1976). Overcrowding per se has been found to be unconstitutional, Gates v. Collier,\\nsupra, McCray v. Sullivan, supra, and Finney v. Arkansas Board of Corrections, supra. This Court\\n395 finds that all three of these *395 cases are existent within the Oklahoma Department of\\nCorrections.\\n5. In the original Order the Court ordered the closing of certain cells at McAlester. Likewise, the\\nwooden facility at Lexington with its severe environmental and fire hazards shocks the Court's\\nconscience and must be closed upon completion of the new Lexington A & R unit.\\n6. The crowding in Oklahoma has reached such proportions that this Court could easily find, as\\nother courts have, that the crowding is per se unconstitutional. Certainly where prisoners are\\nforced to sleep in garages, barber shops, libraries and stairwells; and where they are placed in\\ndormitories without any toilet and shower facilities the crowding has passed the constitutional\\nthreshold. The Court is equally or more offended by the housing of two men within a little 35-40\\nsquare foot \\\"cubbyhole\\\". Such crowding offends the contemporary standards of human decency, \\nTrop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, [78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630] (1958).\\nThe effects of the crowding as it relates to the conditions of confinement with regard to the health,\\nsafety, and security of the inmates is unconstitutional. The crowding has caused the kitchen, water\\nand sewer systems to be overtaxed. The dining facilities, if they were outside the prison walls\\nwould be closed down as immediate health dangers. Individuals are housed in substandard living\\n\\nquarters which are firetraps. However, there is no plan or possibility of putting out the fire if a\\nmajor one occurred.\\nThere is a direct correlation between overcrowding and violence, see finding of fact 16, supra.\\nDefendants acknowledge that the 1973 McAlester riot was caused by the then existing\\novercrowded conditions at the O.S.P. This court would be remiss in its duties if it did not move to\\nact on the problems, but rather sat idly by until the increasing crowding caused another major\\nincident to sweep the Oklahoma Prison system.\\n7. The court adopts the standards of the American Public Health Association for living space and\\nenvironmental matters. APHA calls for 60 square feet in a cell and 75 square feet in a dormitory. In\\nadopting the APHA 60'/75' standards respectively, the Court is mindful that most other\\norganizations and many of the courts who have faced this problem have adopted higher\\nstandards.6\\n6 Organizational standards:\\n70 sq. feet: National Sheriff's Association at 63 (1975)\\n70 sq. feet: Building Officials and Code Administrators, Inc., BOCA Basic Building Code, 1975 \\u00a7\\n201.3\\n70 sq. feet: National Clearinghouse for Criminal Justice Planning and Architecture.\\n75 sq. feet: The American Correctional Association Manual of Correctional Standards 49\\n80 sq. feet: National Advisory Commission for Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Corrections,\\nStandard 11.1, page 353\\n90 sq. feet: The International Conference of Building Officials, Uniform Building Code \\u00a7 1307B, p.\\n83\\nCases:\\n60 sq. feet: Pugh v. Locke, supra.\\n75 sq. feet: Ambrose v. Malcolm, 414 F.Supp. 485 (S.D.N.Y. (1976).\\n88 sq. feet: Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, supra.\\n8. In adopting the APHA environmental standards, the Court points out that a prison facility is a\\nclosed ecosystem. Persons are sent to prison as punishment, not for punishment. It is incumbent\\non the incarcerating body to provide the individual with a healthy habilitative environment.\\nAnything less would be to subject the individual to further punishment than was given by the\\nsentencing trial court. With habilitation assured, then possibly or probably the inmate can decide\\nto rehabilitate himself.\\nBut if the basic habilitative needs of the individual are not met then rehabilitation, reformation or\\nredemption are not possible. Water, fire protection, air and food are necessities of life. Minimum\\nspace to call one's own is a primary psychological necessity. Without the basic minimums prisons\\nare doomed to failure, with both society and the inmates incarcerated therein the losers.\\n9. This Court is well aware of the financial restraints placed on the Defendants and their efforts to\\n396 comply with the *396 Constitution. But the good will shown by the Defendants cannot serve as a\\ndefense. Finney v. Arkansas Board of Correction, supra; Rozechi v. Gaughan, supra; Holt v.\\nSarver, 309 F.Supp. 362, 385 (E.D.Ark., 1972); and Davis v. Lindsay, 321 F.Supp. 1134, 1139\\n(S.D.N.Y., 1970). Nor is the lack of financing a defense to a failure to provide minimum\\nconstitutional standards. Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 580 (8th Cir. 1968); Finney v. Arkansas\\nBoard of Correction, supra at 199; Gates v. Collier, supra, [501 F.2d 1291,] at 1319, 1320 (5th Cir.\\n\\n1974); Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, supra, at 669; and Hamilton v. Love, supra, at 1194. If\\nthe State of Oklahoma wishes to hold the inmates in institutions, it must provide the funds to\\nmaintain the inmates in a constitutionally permissible manner.\\n10. This Court cannot, on the other hand, allow the Defendants to violate the constitutional rights\\nof the Plaintiffs' class and without acting to alleviate the unconstitutional conditions.\\nBased upon the foregoing reasons of unconstitutional confinement of inmates, the Court deems it\\nnecessary to enter the following order to alleviate the unconstitutional treatment of inmates.\\nORDER AND JUDGMENT\\nDefendants are directed to achieve the following goals:\\n(a) Commencing in August, 1977, defendants shall reduce the inmate population at Oklahoma\\nState Penitentiary, McAlester, Oklahoma, at the rate of 100 inmates that month and a like number\\neach succeeding month until the population is reduced to 800 inmates.\\n(b) Commencing in August, 1977, defendants shall reduce the inmate population at the Oklahoma\\nState Reformatory, Granite, Oklahoma, at the rate of 50 inmates that month and a like number\\neach succeeding month until the population is reduced to 450 inmates.\\n(c) The Court does not require the abandonment or discontinued use of any confinement facility at\\nthis time, but within 15 months from the date hereof\\nIn accordance with the trial court's instructions issued on May 24, 1977, the State of Oklahoma submitted to the\\ncourt a proposed plan, as follows:\\nDEFENDANTS' PROPOSED PLAN\\nCome now the defendants above named and in accordance with the Court's instructions issued\\non May 24, 1977, submit the following proposed plan:\\nDefendants, admitting no wrongdoing or violation of any inmate's constitutional rights, submit a\\nsummary of their ongoing plans to the Court to alter the population concentrations existing within\\nthe Oklahoma Department of Corrections. This plan is entered upon with the intent of insuring that\\nno inmate is deprived of his constitutional right. In addition the plan will increase the security within\\nthe institutions and to afford the inmates more opportunity for individualized treatment.\\n1. Within a short time, the Department will open a community treatment center in the Oklahoma\\nCity area with a capacity of up to 100;\\n2. At the beginning of 1978, the Department will open a 400 person Assessment and Reception\\nCenter at Lexington;\\n3. At the beginning of 1978, the Department will establish two additional community treatment\\ncenter with a capacity of up to 100 for each center, enabling more than half of the prisoners\\nreleased from the system to undergo several months of work release programming;\\n4. In the spring of 1978, the Department will open another 400 person institution at Lexington;\\n5. In the spring and summer of 1978, the Department will open 450 bed spaces within housing\\nunits to be constructed, two at Stringtown, two at Quachita, and one at McLeod;\\n6. Early in 1978, the Department will open a 120 person institution at Sulphur for women;\\n7. Immediate implementation of new procedures for parole docketing and new criteria for parole\\n397 consideration will enable *397 a larger number of qualified inmates to see the Pardon and Parole\\nBoard.\\n\\n8. The Department will continue their plan to upgrade utilities in the prison system. This plan will\\nbe accelerated by a $300,000 appropriation currently under consideration by the Legislature;\\n9. Funds have been appropriated or are committed for new construction and facility acquisition\\nwhich will result in development of entirely new bed space during the next 18 months as follows:\\nOklahoma City Community\\n  Treatment Center                        100\\nTwo additional community\\n  treatment centers                       200\\nHodgens housing units                     150\\nMcLeod housing units                      100\\nStringtown housing units                  200\\nLexington Assessment and\\n  Reception Center                        400\\nLexington Correctional Center             400\\nHominy Correctional Center                400\\nSulphur Women's Facility                  120\\n                                           _____\\nTOTAL NEW BED SPACE:                       2,070\\n10. On or before January 1, 1979, each inmate under the Department of Corrections shall have a\\nminimum of 60 square feet in a room, cell, or dorm. The only exception shall be within the walls at\\nthe Penitentiary and the Reformatory where no more than one man will be housed per cell, except\\nin the large cells in the F-cellhouse at the Penitentiary where two inmates will be permitted to\\noccupy each cell.\\nThe State of Oklahoma filed a Notice of Appeal from the Trial Court's Order of June 14, 1977, and in conjunction\\ntherewith moved the Trial Court for an order staying enforcement of that Order and any further proceedings\\npending appeal. The motion for stay was denied by the district court on July 5, 1977, after consideration of and\\ndetailed recitals directed to the criteria to be considered and treated governing the propriety of a stay order\\npending an appeal, as follows: (1) whether the appellant has made strong showing that he is likely to prevail on\\nthe merits of the appeal, (2) whether the appellant has shown irreparable injury if the stay is not granted, (3)\\nwhether a stay will substantially harm the other parties to the litigation, and (4) where the public interests lie. In\\ntreating these tests leading to the denial of the Motion for Stay, the Trial Court found:\\nThe defendants made certain conclusory allegations in their Application that there is a substantial\\nlikelihood that they will prevail on appeal. They cite no cases or other law to show that they have\\nany likelihood of success at all. To put the appeal in proper perspective it is necessary to\\nremember what this appeal is really about. It really does not relate to the merits of the case but\\nonly to what relief the Court should afford the plaintiffs' class. Unconstitutional conditions now, and\\nfor a long time, have prevailed in the Oklahoma State penal system. This was judicially\\ndetermined by the Court in its May 30, 1974 Order herein. 376 F.Supp. 402. That Order was not\\nappealed by defendants and is unchallenged today. It is undenied that the overcrowded conditions\\nwhich were the focus of the May, 1977, hearings amount to cruel and unusual punishment. There\\n\\nis no evidence to the contrary and counsel for the defendants has never seriously argued to the\\ncontrary.\\nSince the unconstitutionality of the conditions is undisputed the only real question is how much\\nlonger plaintiffs' class must endure their constitutional deprivations. Given the history of the case\\nand the magnitude of the violations this Court believes that it is improbable that any court would\\nconclude that it is arbitrary and capricious to grant immediate relief to the victims who are helpless\\nand who are now suffering the cruel and unusual punishment which is now being imposed by the\\ndefendants by virtue of the unconstitutional conditions.\\nIn their Application the defendants further claim irreparable harm because the Order allegedly\\nmandates \\\"transfers, paroles, releases, or restrictions by [state] District Judges against\\n398 confinement of convicted felons, without due regard for *398 the safety of the general public and\\nthe employees and officers of the institutions of the State of Oklahoma and the health and well-\\nbeing of the inmates incarcerated therein.\\\" This is an extravagant and unsupported statement.\\nThe Court mandated only the reduction in population levels at the two institutions. It did not\\npurport to dictate or mandate the means by which the defendants can accomplish the established\\ngoals. Similarly, defendants allege \\\"the Court has adopted a posture of administering the\\nOklahoma Correctional System in abuse of its constitutional authority and jurisdiction.\\\" The Court\\nhas only decreed that the overcrowded conditions in the two particular facilities must be eliminated\\nwithin a prescribed time period. The details and administration of a program are left solely to the\\ndiscretion of the defendants. The Court is interested in ends and not means so long as they are\\nlawful. Defendant further contends that the Order \\\"will unduly disrupt the orderly operation of the\\npenal institutions of the State of Oklahoma.\\\" This presumes that the prolongation of the\\nunconstitutional conditions is essential to the \\\"orderly operation\\\" of the system. The Court rejects\\nthe idea that constitutionality is incompatible with orderliness and that a constitutional operation is\\nby definition disorderly. Defendants also raise the fear that the Order may result in the premature\\nrelease of inmates. This fear should be abandoned. The Order specifically provides that no inmate\\nshall be prematurely released; that the defendant may apply for a release of the timely schedule of\\ndepopulation of the two institutions at any time.\\nThe Order itself has a built-in safeguard to permit the defendants to avoid any irreparable injury.\\nAll that is required of the defendants is that they undertake in August, 1977, and each succeeding\\nmonth thereafter, in good faith, and with due diligence, an attempt to comply with the schedule in\\nthe Order. If they do so, \\\"with all the means and resources available to them,\\\" the Court expects\\nand demands no more. If the threat of irreparable injury becomes real rather than speculative, the\\ndefendants may apply to the Court for temporary relief and delay. By its terms the Order does not\\ndecree the impossible and does protect the free majority. If the defendants will avail themselves, if\\nnecessary, of this provision of the Order and make the required showing of impossibility or\\n\\\"demonstrably dangerous\\\" threat, defendants can avoid any irreparable harm. Defendants should\\nnot object to being required to demonstrate rather than merely imagine the consequences of\\nimplementing the schedule.\\nThe third burden which defendants have in order to justify a stay is to show that no substantial\\nharm will come to the other interested parties if the stay is granted. North Central Truck Lines,\\nInc., v. United States, 384 F.Supp. 1188 (W.D.Mo.1974), aff'd., 420 U.S. 901 [95 S.Ct. 820, 42\\nL.Ed.2d 832.] The defendants largely ignore this requirement. The evidence of existing\\nenvironmental health and safety problems in the system is overwhelming. There is no doubt that\\nthe overcrowding increases the incident of both infectious communicable diseases (e. g., flu,\\nhepatitis, tuberculosis, etc.,) and stress related diseases (e. g., rashes, asthma, hypertension,\\netc.). Defendants offer no assurances that in the do-nothing interim requested by them, that\\ninmate fatalities or permanent impairment of the physical and mental health of inmates will not\\nresult from these causes. It is a harsh thing to say that the lives and health of inmates must be\\nsacrificed to the administrative convenience of the defendants.\\n\\nFinally, where does the public interest lie? This is never an easy question to resolve. It is\\nespecially difficult in this type of case, where the plaintiffs' class are generally a feared and\\ndespised class. Frequently the issue is confused by the political posturing of public officials. The\\nCourt does not purport to be an oracle, able to foresee the future with a clear vision, but it does\\n399 know that in July *399 1973 a public disaster occurred at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\nMcAlester. Lives were lost. It cost the public many millions of dollars of property destroyed by fire\\nand the public is still paying a high price for the actions and neglect of defendants' predecessors.\\nFrom the complex of factors involved, the overriding cause must be ascribed to the inhuman and\\nunconstitutional conditions which then prevailed. This is not to justify the riots, but only to state a\\nfact. Similar conditions now exist. The public interest obviously would be badly served by a repeat\\nof that catastrophe. The risk of a stay is very great. If, however, the Order is properly executed the\\nrisk is greatly reduced. The Court has not required or ordered the premature release of any\\nprisoner. The defendants must exercise their expertise and good judgment in the matter of\\nprisoner release. The Court has to believe that in the immediate as well as in the long run the\\npublic interest in best served by adherence to the Constitution and the protection of the rights of\\nall helpless human beings.\\nAs evidenced by the foregoing analysis the defendants have failed to make a strong showing that\\nsuccess on the merits of the appeal is likely, that unless a stay is granted irreparable harm will\\nresult; that no substantial harm will come to the plaintiffs' class; that granting of the stay will do no\\nharm to the public interest. Therefore the Application for Stay should be denied.\\nThereafter, on July 20, 1977, the State of Oklahoma filed with this court a Motion for Stay, invoking the provisions\\nof Rule 8 of the Fed.Rules of Appellate Proc., 28 U.S.C.A. That Motion was granted and has been subsequently\\nextended and continued to date. The contentions raised in relation thereto are considered by this court as part\\nand parcel of the issues on the merits to be decided on appeal. In the Motion for Stay the State of Oklahoma\\nalleges, inter alia, that (a) the subject order requires the transfer of inmates to less secure institutions within the\\nsystem, (b) the State of Oklahoma has previously presented the trial court with a plan for accomplishing the\\norderly reduction in inmate population at certain institutions, increasing the capacity at other institutions as well as\\npurchasing and constructing new facilities, (c) the aforesaid plan or program has been funded and approved by\\nthe Governor and the State Legislature of the State of Oklahoma and mutually agreed to by all of the parties, and\\n(d) that if this court fails to stay the Order, the State of Oklahoma must choose between two unacceptable\\nactions: first, order inmates transferred to other institutions which have less security, or operating with greater\\npopulations than are desirable, place violent and passive inmates in close association, reduce supervision,\\nincrease the likelihood of escape and subject the citizens of Oklahoma to increased danger, or, second, to follow\\nall the recognized practices of accepted penology, protect the lives and rights of employees, inmates and\\ncitizens, but to incur the legal contempt of the court. Finally, the State of Oklahoma points out that the movement\\nof inmates necessitates staff transfers, budgetary changes, construction of additional facilities, contracts and\\nbidding procedures which must follow state laws, and numerous other administrative problems which require\\nseveral months of advanced planning to accomplish, which has, in fact, been considered and incorporated into\\nthe State's plan for new institutions, as well as the reduction of inmate population at the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary and the Oklahoma State Reformatory. The State of Oklahoma complains that Battle, et al., and the\\nUnited States, as intervenor, presented \\\"absolutely no evidence concerning medical problems, increased\\nviolence level, brutality, use of trustee guards, inadequate food and clothing or an excessive amount of time\\nspent in cells\\\" while acknowledging that \\\"the testimony concerning these critical areas was solicited on cross-\\nexamination from the defendants, Director Benton and Warden Crisp.\\\" [Brief of Defendants-Appellants, p. 10.]\\n400 Such does not support the contention that the trial court was without *400 substantial evidence to support its\\nfindings. The record indicates otherwise. Nor are we impressed with the State of Oklahoma's contention that the\\nTrial Court denied it a fair hearing or that the court was \\\"misled and unduly swayed\\\" by its consideration of\\nalleged inadmissible exhibits and unsubstantiated facts. As to the \\\"fair hearing\\\" contention, the record establishes\\nthat even though proper notice was submitted by the court, the State of Oklahoma did not request a pre-trial\\nconference or any request of the court to obtain a list of witnesses or other matters. [R., Vol. I, pp. 8-11.] While\\nthe entire record does indeed reflect that certain hearsay and/or questionable exhibits (from an evidentiary point\\nof view) were presented, there is nothing indicating that they \\\"misled or unduly swayed\\\" the Trial Court or even\\n\\nthat the Trial Court in fact relied upon them. We observe that even though the \\\"foundation\\\" challenges to certain\\nexhibits are not without substance, there is no doubt from the record that most of them were in fact documents\\nprepared by agencies and/or departments of the State of Oklahoma. [For example, see Vol. I, pp. 254-265.]\\nWe are satisfied that the State of Oklahoma has, since the 1973 disastrous riot, made significant progress in\\nupgrading its penal system. The State contends that the 1974 Oklahoma Legislature appropriated\\n$16,285,090.00 to the penal system, representing an increase of 46.9% over the previous year; that the 1976\\nLegislature appropriated $44,000,000.00, an increase of 534% over the 1973 appropriation. There can be no\\ndoubt that the State of Oklahoma has, as the District Court acknowledged, made significant strides and efforts to\\nremedy the serious deficiencies. Even so, the Court's finding that the presently existing overcrowding condition at\\nthe two facilities, when considered with other circumstances, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is not\\nclearly erroneous. We hold that there is substantial evidence supporting the finding. It was made, to be sure,\\nnotwithstanding the comprehensive Plan prepared and submitted to the Court by the State of Oklahoma and\\napproved by all parties to this litigation. That Plan established a priority goal by the State in the commitment of its\\nfiscal and administrative resources to expeditiously upgrade its entire penal-correctional system. We commend\\nthe State of Oklahoma and its people for the actions taken. Even so, we must hold that the Trial Court did not err\\nin its order here challenged. We cannot, on the basis of the record before us, arbitrarily substitute our judgment\\nfor that of the resident federal district judge who has given so much of his time, conscience and effort to this on-\\ngoing case. His concern for the protection of the constitutional rights of the inmates goes to the \\\"heart\\\" of their\\nphysical and mental well being. We believe that the Trial Court has endeavored to diligently accommodate the\\nconcurrent problems confronting the State of Oklahoma. We agree with the District Court that the exigencies\\nweigh in favor of the inmates.\\nWe have carefully considered the State of Oklahoma's request for the additional time required to effectuate its\\ncomprehensive Plan which the State deems necessary in order to fashion a solid basis for future planning and\\nadministration of the state's penal system. In relation to the Stay Order, the State of Oklahoma alleges that the\\nTrial Court has mandated an arbitrary reduction of the inmate population with fixed schedules in the face of a\\nreasonable and feasible State plan already adopted and designed to remove the conditions complained of which\\nhas met with the consent of all of the parties. The State of Oklahoma does not challenge or dispute the fact of\\novercrowding at the two penal facilities affected by the reduction order, but it does emphatically argue that those\\nconditions are not such as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\\nDuring oral argument, counsel for the State of Oklahoma emphasized that the record simply does not support the\\nTrial Court's findings that the inmates at the two affected facilities are being subjected to cruel and unusual\\npunishment. On the contrary, it was contended that they are not in anywise ill treated.\\n401 *401 Bobby Battle, et al. (the inmate class), by and through the American Civil Liberties Union, have resisted the\\nMotion for Stay, pointing to the uncontroverted facts of overcrowding and the intolerable conditions of\\nconfinement found by the Trial Court to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Battle contends that the facts\\nfound are not denied by the State of Oklahoma and that the \\\"defendants totally ignore the danger which these\\npractices [overcrowding in cells, inadequate ventilation, fire protection and sanitation] place the inmate population\\nin.\\\" Battle argues that the Trial Court's order was issued after careful, deliberate proceedings and consideration,\\non the basis of overwhelming evidence of unconstitutional prison conditions. Further, Battle alleges that the State\\nof Oklahoma is not entitled to a stay simply because it must go to some extra effort in order to comply. Battle\\nargues that the State fails on each of the four factors this Court must consider in granting the requested stay: (1)\\nwhether the State has made a strong showing that it is likely to prevail on the merits of the appeal, (2) whether\\nthe State has shown irreparable injury if the stay is not granted, (3) whether a stay will substantially harm the\\nother parties to the litigation, and (4) where the public interest lies. Battle contends that the State of Oklahoma\\nhas virtually ignored these requirements.\\nThe United States of America, as Plaintiff Intervenor, by and through the Attorney General, Department of Justice,\\nhas moved to deny State's Motion for Stay, alleging, inter alia, that the State of Oklahoma has not specifically\\naddressed itself to the four (4) elements of the criteria above referred to in determining the propriety of a stay\\norder pending compliance with the Plan. Furthermore, the United States argues that even had the State done so,\\nit could not have prevailed in the face of the continuation of physical conditions and practices at the two\\ninstitutions which the District Court found to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in relation to the inmate\\n\\npopulation. The United States urges that the stay be denied in that the continuation of the intolerable conditions\\nwill require inmates to suffer substantial harm by being forced to live in less than 20 square feet and to be housed\\nin facilities which are unfit for human habitation. Further, the United States argues that the State's Plan,\\nconsented to by the parties, was not submitted at or during any of the three hearings dealing with the issue of\\novercrowding and that, in fact, the Plan was not written until after the trial court's May 24, 1977, bench ruling and\\nwas not presented to the parties until June 13, 1977. The record confirms this contention. The United States also\\nalleges that the inmate reduction order was orally communicated by the Court on May 24, 1977 and that the\\nparties were directed to confer upon the timetable, knowing that the Court was considering a range of 90 to 180\\ndays. Again, the record bears this out. [R., Vol. I, p. 282.] However, the United States does agree that the parties\\ndid present to the Court a draft order which contained the Plan's recommended construction timetable, but which\\ndid not deal with either the numerical or time limitations ordered by the Trial Court from the bench. Accordingly,\\nthe United States contends that the Trial Court's order requiring a reduction of inmate population on a timetable\\nbasis is clearly within the equitable power of the Court and a matter directly addressed by the Court at the\\nconclusion of the May 24, 1977 hearing.\\nDISPOSITION\\nWe hold that the challenged Order of the District Court is supported by substantial evidence. We direct that the\\nStay Order Pending Appeal entered by this Court as thereafter extended and continued, be and the same is\\nhereby vacated.\\nWe hold that the Trial Court's finding that the overcrowding inmate population at the two subject Oklahoma\\ninstitutions constitutes cruel and unusual punishment proscribed under the Eighth Amendment to the United\\nStates Constitution, is supported by substantial evidence. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50\\n402 L.Ed.2d 251,supra. In that case the Court held that a state prisoner's civil rights complaint *402 lodged under 42\\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment for inadequate treatment of a back\\ninjury while engaged in work in the Texas penitentiary must be entertained, and that deliberate indifference by\\nprison personnel to a prisoner's serious injury or illness constitutes cruel and unusual punishment contravening\\nthe Eighth Amendment. The court there reviewed the history of the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual\\npunishment. It noted that the primary concern of the constitutional drafters was to proscribe \\\"tortures\\\" and other\\n\\\"barbarous\\\" methods of punishment. The court then related:\\nOur more recent cases, however, have held that the Amendment proscribes more than physically\\nbarbarous punishments. See, e. g., Gregg v. Georgia, supra [428 U.S. 153] at 171, [96 S.Ct. 2909\\nat 2924] (plurality opinion); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-101, [78 S.Ct. 590, 597, 598, 2\\nL.Ed.2d 630] (1958); Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 373 [30 S.Ct. 544, 551, 54 L.Ed.\\n793] (1910).

Utah, supra, [996 U.S. 130] at 136, [25\\nL.Ed. 345].\\nThese elementary principles establish the government's obligation to provide medical care for\\nthose whom it is punishing by incarceration. An inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his\\nmedical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met. In the worst cases, such\\na failure may actually produce physical \\\"torture or a lingering death,\\\" In re Kemmler [136 U.S. 436,\\n10 S.Ct. 930, 34 L.Ed. 519,] supra, the evils of most immediate concern to the drafters of the\\nAmendment.

Georgia, supra, [428 U.S.\\n153] at 171-74, [96 S.Ct. 2909 at 2924-25] (plurality opinion). The infliction of such unnecessary\\nsuffering is inconsistent with contemporary standards of decency as manifested in modern\\nlegislation codifying the commonlaw view that \\\"[i]t is but just that the public be required to care for\\nthe prisoner, who cannot, by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, care for himself.\\\"\\nIn Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) the Supreme Court stated, inter alia:\\nOf course, the requirements of the Eighth Amendment must be applied with an awareness of the\\nlimited role to be played by the courts. This does not mean that judges have no role to play, for the\\nEighth Amendment is a restraint upon the exercise of legislative power.\\n\\\"Judicial review, by definition, often involves a conflict between judicial and legislative judgment as\\nto what the Constitution means or requires. In this respect, Eighth Amendment cases come to us\\nin no different posture.

Georgia, 408 U.S. [238]\\nat 313-314, [92 S.Ct. 2706, 2825, 33 L.Ed.2d 346] (White, J. concurring.)\\n428 U.S. at p. 174, 96 S.Ct., at p. 2925.\\n403 *403 It is the obligation of the federal courts to be ever alert not to intrude into the affairs of state prison\\nadministration unless there is displayed a clear failure by the State to take cognizance of an inmate's valid federal\\nconstitutional rights. We are satisfied that in the instant case neither this court nor the District Court has interfered\\nwith matters in the sole discretion of state officials. We believe that while an inmate does not have a federal\\nconstitutional right to rehabilitation, he is entitled to be confined in an environment which does not result in his\\ndegeneration or which threatens his mental and physical well being.\\nThe State of Oklahoma argues that if this Court affirms the Trial Court's order and if the inmates are transferred to\\nother institutions \\\"which have less security, or operating with greater populations than are desirable\\\" that such\\naction will place violent and passive inmates in close association, reduce supervision, increase the likelihood of\\nescape and subject the people of Oklahoma to increased danger. We would wish such risks away if wishing\\nserved the purpose. We agree with the Trial Court finding, that while the State of Oklahoma has made significant\\nprogress in correcting many of the abuses and/or providing for new or additional facilities, personnel and\\nprograms within its penal system, still the State has not prevented the degenerated overcrowding conditions\\nwhich have come to pass at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester and at the Oklahoma State\\nReformatory at Granite. The transfer of the inmates as ordered by the Trial Court is, of course, subject to change\\nor modification if the District Court deems such action necessary and proper in the future. Viewing the facts and\\ncircumstances contained in the record in their totality, we hold that the Order here challenged must be affirmed.\\nWhile neither this Court nor the District Court holds to the proposition that prisoners subjected to the punishment\\nof incarceration are entitled to the rights and privileges of one who has not committed a crime against person or\\nproperty crying out for retribution, still the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment cannot be countenanced in\\nan orderly society. While the rights and privileges necessarily lost 00 and, in effect, surrendered 00 by prisoners in\\n97 97\\npunishment for crimes committed are many and varied, they cannot be denied all rights and privileges.

The\\ncomplaint seeks injunctive relief, on behalf of all members of the plaintiff class, to remedy the alleged misconduct\\nof the defendants as well as monetary damages for plaintiff Battle.\\nNamed as defendants were Leo McCracken, Director of Corrections, Park J. Anderson, Warden, and Sam C.\\nJohnston, Deputy Warden of the State Penitentiary at McAlester. Since the commencement of this action, Leo\\nMcCracken has been replaced by John Grider, who now serves as Acting Director of Corrections, and Park J.\\nAnderson has been replaced by Sam C. Johnston, who now serves as Acting Warden of the State Penitentiary at\\nMcAlester, and Mr. Pete Douglas has replaced Sam C. Johnston as Acting Deputy Warden. Mr. Roy Sprinkle,\\nDeputy Director of Corrections in charge of Institutions, Captain Black, Danny Nace and Otis Campbell,\\nCorrectional Officers at the State Penitentiary, have been added as defendants.\\nOn March 15, 1973, the late Judge Edwin Langley granted the United States' Motion to Intervene pursuant to\\nTitle IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000h-2. The complaint in intervention alleged segregation by\\nrace in housing assignments and certain other aspects of penitentiary operations.\\n\\nOn March 5, 1974, the Court granted the United States' motion to amend its complaint in intervention which now\\nalleges, in addition to the allegations of the original complaint in intervention, that the defendants have\\ndiscriminated against black inmates in making job assignments and in the operation of the penitentiary\\ndisciplinary system; and that they have, with regard to all inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, without\\nregard to race, subjected them to disciplinary procedures and taken disciplinary action against them without\\nproviding due process of law; subjected those inmates in disciplinary segregation to cruel and unusual\\n408 punishment by depriving them of food, clothing, bedding, light and necessary *408 personal hygiene items;\\nplaced inmates in non-disciplinary administrative segregation without providing them with due process of law and\\nsubjected them to unreasonable conditions of confinement; inflicted upon inmates summary punishment without\\ndue process of law and cruel and unusual punishment by the use of chemical agents, including mace and tear\\ngas; inflicted upon inmates cruel and unusual punishment by maintaining and operating a medical care delivery\\nsystem that is incapable of providing and has failed to provide adequate medical care; imposed upon inmates\\narbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on mailing privileges, including censorship and rejection of mail to and\\nfrom attorneys, courts, government officials, family members and religious ministers; refused inmates the right to\\nsubscribe to or receive personal legal reference materials, as well as certain other periodicals; and denied\\ninmates adequate access to the courts by failing to provide an adequate law library or any reasonable and\\nadequate alternative thereto and by specifically refusing to permit inmates to have in their possession any\\npersonal legal reference materials or to assist each other on legal problems.\\nThe parties have conducted extensive pretrial discovery consisting of depositions, inspections and investigations\\nconducted by attorneys, FBI agents and experts in penology.\\nAt the final pretrial conference held on March 4, 1974, counsel orally stipulated and agreed and the court ordered\\nthat all depositions taken prior to trial be admitted into evidence and made a part of the record.\\nTrial on the merits was heard at McAlester, Oklahoma, on March 14 and 15, 1974. At the outset, counsel for all\\nparties stipulated and agreed to the authenticity of copies of documents marked exhibits 1 through 161 and\\ncontained in 18 bound volumes previously tendered to counsel and the court by the United States. It was further\\nstipulated and agreed and the court ordered that the said exhibits be admitted into evidence and made a part of\\nthe record in this case.\\nUpon the basis of the depositions and exhibits and the oral testimony heard at the trial of this case and the cases\\nof Holland et al. v. Anderson (No. 73-324) heard on March 12, 1974, and the consolidated cases of Barnett et al.\\nv. Hall (No. 73-237), Johnson v. Anderson (No. 74-8), Barnett et al. v. Pontesso (No. 70-97) and Johnson et al. v.\\nAnderson (No. 72-90) heard on March 13, 1974, the court makes its findings of fact and conclusions of law as\\nfollows:\\nFindings of Fact\\n1. The Oklahoma State Penitentiary system consists of a main maximum security facility at McAlester and\\nseveral subsidiary institutions located at McAlester and other locations throughout the southeastern and western\\nportion of Oklahoma. These subsidiaries include a dual unit women's ward and a male trusty unit which are also\\nlocated at McAlester; a medium security vocational training school located at Stringtown, Oklahoma, about 40\\nmiles south of McAlester; a smaller minimum security facility for vocational training located near Hodgens,\\nOklahoma; and an Honor farm near Farris, Oklahoma.\\n2. The Oklahoma State Penitentiary System was established by law for the purpose of housing persons\\ncommitted to the custody of the Department of Corrections under the administrative direction and control of the\\nDivision of Institutions, Title 57 O.S.A. \\u00a7 509.\\n3. The Board of Corrections, composed of seven members appointed by the Governor, appoints the Director of\\nthe Department of Corrections. The Board has statutory authority to establish policies for the operation of the\\nDepartment. Title 57 O.S.A. \\u00a7\\u00a7 503, 504. The Director of the Department of Corrections is vested by statute with\\nthe authority and responsibility for the operation of all facilities within the department, for prescribing rules\\n\\n409 pertaining to the management of said institutions *409 and for the control, care and treatment of inmates\\nremanded to the custody of the Department of Corrections. Title 57 O.S.A. \\u00a7\\u00a7 507 and 510. Such rules, when\\nreduced to writing, are customarily promulgated in the form of departmental policy statements, but may also be\\nissued in the form of operations memoranda.\\nThe Deputy Director of Corrections in charge of Institutions is appointed by the Director and is charged with the\\nadministrative responsibility for the operation of all facilities within the Department of Corrections. Title 57 O.S.A.\\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 508, 509.\\nThe Warden of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester is vested by statute with the responsibility for\\nperforming all duties pertaining to the penitentiary as are fixed by the Director of Corrections. Title 57 O.S.A. \\u00a7\\n510. The established duties of the Warden include supervisory responsibility for the government and operation of\\nthe Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester, Oklahoma, and its subsidiary units. Written rules issued pursuant\\nto the authority of the Warden are promulgated in the form of memoranda, directives, etc.\\n4. All persons convicted of felonies and sentenced by duly constituted courts of the State of Oklahoma to a term\\nof imprisonment which is not to be served in a county jail are committed to the custody of the Oklahoma\\nDepartment of Corrections to be confined in one of the facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Department. Title\\n57 O.S.A. \\u00a7 521.\\n5. Between January, 1970 and July 27, 1973, the total population in the penitentiary system averaged about\\n2,990 male and 120 female inmates. The largest concentration of inmates in the system was \\\"behind the walls\\\" at\\nthe main facility at McAlester.\\n6. On July 27, 1973, a riot occurred at the McAlester facility which resulted in the destruction of some physical\\nfacilities and damage to others. Following the riot, many programs, procedures, practices and operations that had\\nbeen in effect at the penitentiary were either eliminated or curtailed. The general inmate population was placed\\non a twenty-four-hour lockdown which continued with only minor modifications at the time of the trial in this case.\\nNumerous examples could be cited from the record of practices and conditions which were justified as\\nemergency measures in the immediate aftermath of the riot and even for some time thereafter, but which were\\nstill in substantial effect at the time of the trial of this case, long after their justification had ended.\\n7. During the 7 months of 1973 prior to the riot, the inmate population at the main facility averaged about 1778 or\\n57% of the total penitentiary population. The racial composition of the population at the main facility averaged\\n29.5% Black and 70.5% non-Black inmates. Many of these inmates were transferred to subsidiary institutions and\\nto municipal and county holding facilities and commitments to McAlester were suspended following the riot. The\\npopulation at McAlester dropped to 1338 in August 1973, and after several additional reductions has leveled off\\nat approximately 900 inmates since the first of this year.\\n8. Prior to the riot, the facilities at the main penitentiary consisted of an administration building, four general\\npopulation cellhouses and a mess hall radiating from a central rotunda, a maximum security unit and combination\\nhospital-gymnasium and a series of industrial and maintenance buildings, some of which were located in the\\n\\\"industrial area\\\" north of the main walls. Two of the general population cellhouses were constructed in 1907. The\\nthird and fourth units were added in 1932 and 1935. The design capacity of the penitentiary was approximately\\n1,200.\\n9. The civilian staff level of about 350 at the main McAlester facility has remained fairly constant. Out of this total\\ncivilian staff, about 242 have been employed as security personnel holding the rank of Correctional Officer I\\n410 (about 160 men); Correctional Officer *410 II (about 65 men); Correctional Officer III or Lieutenant (about 11\\nmen); and Correctional Officer IV or Captain (about 6 men). Under the normal conditions as they existed before\\nthe riot, the security staff provided 24 hour, 7 day a week supervision and surveillance over the cellhouses,\\nlockup areas, guard towers and hospital complex. The staff also provided daytime supervision and surveillance\\nover the work areas (industrial, maintenance and administrative), the yard and special inmate work gangs. They\\nalso supplied the supervision required for the transfer of inmates to other Oklahoma penal facilities, to outside\\nmedical facilities and to the courts. Their post-riot activities have generally consisted of carrying out such security\\nfunctions as were deemed necessary, from time to time, by penitentiary authorities.\\n\\n10. The security force at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester is understaffed and spread far too thin.\\nThe continuing deficiencies in needed personnel have been at least 30 to 35 percent less than the level required\\nto maintain adequate supervision and control. This limited staff is inadequately trained and poorly supervised.\\nThere is a high turnover among correctional officers; the monthly rate reaching 8 to 9 percent, particularly among\\nlower echelon security personnel. Proper training may well be impossible with this shortage of personnel\\naccompanied by such a continuing turnover rate.\\nThe available security force is simply inadequate to maintain proper order and carry on even minimally effective\\ncorrections operations. Staffing deficiencies have been a causative factor in the conditions which existed and still\\nexist at the penitentiary. The level of violence inside the penitentiary has been alarming. From January 1970 until\\nJuly 27, 1973, defendants' own records reflect a total of 19 violent deaths. In addition, there were 40 stabbings\\nand 44 serious beatings of inmates. Some of the violence occurred in the cellhouses where frequently only one\\nguard was available for an entire cellhouse. Some violence occurred on the prison yard where frequently only\\none or two guards were available to supervise and control the entire general population.\\n11. Since the riot, lack of adequate security has been used continously as an excuse for the confinement of the\\nmajority of inmates in their cells 24 hours a day, in complete idleness and without any form of exercise or other\\nrecreation. As previously indicated, this massive and almost total lockdown has continued for over 8 months, with\\nthe limited exception that inmates not confined in disciplinary maximum security have recently been granted the\\nmeager privilege of eating one or two meals in the mess hall every other day provided adequate security is\\navailable. Only a limited number of inmates are regularly permitted out of their cells to perform penitentiary\\nmaintenance and housekeeping chores such as preparing food and repairing or maintaining the physical\\ncomplex.\\nRacial Discrimination and Segregation\\n12. Prior to the July riot, the policy and practice at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary was to maintain a prison\\nsystem segregated by race and by means of which black inmates were subjected to discriminatory and unequal\\ntreatment. Except for the maximum security unit, where inmates under disciplinary punishment were confined in\\nsingle cells, all inmates were routinely assigned to housing units on the basis of race. The reception center, the\\nmess hall, the recreation yard and barber facilities were racially segregated. Black inmates were discriminated\\nagainst in job assignments and were subjected to more frequent and disparate punishment than white inmates.\\nThe guard force was and remains predominantly white. A policy statement issued by the Department of\\nCorrections on October 20, 1972, declared the official departmental policy to be that all of its correctional facilities\\nwould be integrated in order to insure equal rights and equal opportunity to all persons confined therein. This\\n411 policy *411 statement also directed correctional administrators to formulate, implement and follow up procedures\\nto insure that discrimination did not occur in practice. The need to increase minority personnel at every level was\\nmade clear and it was suggested that each correctional facility appoint an official to be directly responsible for\\nsupervising the recruitment and fair treatment of minority employees. A departmental operations memorandum\\nissued on the same date set forth specific requirements for the implementation of the departmental policy\\nstatement. Wardens at each state penal facility were directed to prepare plans for complete integration, to take\\nimmediate action to inform and instruct all employees regarding the official policy on racial segregation and of\\ntheir obligations thereunder, to implement an objective and fair classification system for inmates with respect to\\nall aspects of institutional life, to inform the inmates of the racial segregation policy, and to make telephonic\\nprogress reports each Monday morning to the Deputy Director of Institutions or the Director of the Department of\\nCorrections detailing the percentages of integration at each location and any major problems encountered. Both\\nthe policy statement and accompanying operations memorandum were completely ignored by the Warden at the\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester. Racial segregation, as had been practiced prior to the issuance of\\nthese directives, continued unabated. Not until the July riot did any noticeable changes occur. Only at that time,\\noperating under emergency conditions, were inmates randomly lined up and ordered into cells. At the present\\ntime the housing units are not racially segregated. Due to perceived emergency conditions the prison population\\nis temporarily confined to single cells under 24 hour lockdown. The defendants have instituted a security\\nclassification system under which inmates are assigned either a medium, maximum, or close custody grade and\\n\\nseparated into various housing units according to their respective classifications. The new grading system does\\nnot, however, provide for specific cell assignments and transfers on a non-racial basis. Accordingly, there is no\\npresent assurance that housing units will not become resegregated when normal operations are restored.\\nDisciplinary Rules, Punishment and Procedure\\n13. Prior to the July 27, 1973, riot, defendants administered a disciplinary program which could result in punitive\\nsanctions including punitive segregation as well as loss of incentive time and other privileges. These sanctions\\nwere imposed pursuant to a disciplinary process which is described in departmental policy statements and in the\\nmost recent inmate manual. Viewing the disciplinary process as a whole, to include both policies and practices,\\ndefendants have failed to afford inmates the procedural safeguards which are minimally necessary to insure\\nfundamental fairness. The record discloses the following:\\n(a) Inmates are not fairly adequately apprised of the conduct which can lead to disciplinary action.\\nSome, but not all, punishable conduct is contained in various rule books and manuals. There is,\\nhowever, no policy limiting punishment to listed infractions; some infractions are specified in\\nemployee manuals, but excluded from inmate rule books; some of the most common, minor\\ninfractions are nowhere listed or defined although punishment routinely results in the event of\\nviolations. In some instances, inmates have been punished for violating unwritten rules against\\nconstitutionally protected activity (e. g., assisting or being assisted by one another in legal matters\\nin the absence of reasonable alternatives).\\n(b) In the event that disciplinary charges are filed, the applicable Department of Corrections policy\\nstatement provides for pre-hearing detention in \\\"serious cases\\\" only. It was formerly the official\\n412 O.S.P. practice *412 to segregate only those charged with \\\"major\\\" offenses, as described in the\\nemployee manual. This practice was later changed by O.S.P. officials, and, thereafter, all inmates\\ncharged with any rule infraction(s) were automatically confined in segregation, prior to a hearing,\\nin the punishment work gang lockup area located in New Cellhouse or the new jail in the West\\nCellhouse. Because the Disciplinary Committee usually met only once a week, inmates could\\nroutinely be held in segregation for up to six days without a hearing, regardless of the seriousness\\nof the offense charged. Inmates have in fact been so held for up to six weeks before receiving\\ntheir hearings.\\n(c) The Department of Corrections has published rules governing the procedures to be followed at\\ndisciplinary hearings. They do not require, however, that the disciplinary committee be comprised\\nof disinterested persons. In practice, hearings have been and are held on occasion before\\ncommittees with a member or members who have either brought the charges against the inmate\\nor otherwise participated in the preparation or processing thereof.\\n(d) The official policy is to afford inmates a prehearing interview and an opportunity to appear and\\nbe heard at the hearing itself. Inmates are, however, denied the right to call witnesses on their\\nown behalf or to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. No representation is provided by\\nthe institution and outside assistance from counsel or any other source is prohibited.\\n(e) There are no departmental rules, criteria or standards governing the type or duration of\\npunishment which the disciplinary committee may impose for any given infraction. It has been the\\npolicy and practice at the penitentiary to impose indefinite sentences to the various lockup\\nfacilities. As a result of this practice, inmates have in fact often been held on punitive segregation\\nfor prolonged terms (which frequently reached six months to a year) under extremely harsh\\nrestraints and conditions.\\n(f) It is the written policy of the Department of Corrections to afford a weekly review of all persons\\non lockup by the Deputy Warden or his designee. The Standard to be applied and the procedures\\nto be followed during these review sessions are not, however, set forth. In practice, there is no\\nmeaningful independent review by the Deputy Warden or other high-ranking, responsible\\n\\nadministrative officer or panel. Instead, the responsibility for determining length of confinement\\nhas been abdicated to the correctional officers in charge of the individual lockups.\\n(g) The officer in charge of the Maximum Security Unit has been permitted to punish inmates\\nsummarily, without a hearing or any other procedural safeguards for conduct which takes place in\\nthe unit. Accordingly, inmates have had the minimal privileges afforded on M.S.U. further reduced\\nfor conduct deemed objectionable by the officers in charge. Similarly, inmates may be transferred\\nto one of several isolation cells on M.S. U. at the sole discretion of the officer in charge, without\\nany procedural safeguards other than the informal requirement that the Deputy Warden or chief of\\nSecurity be notified.\\n14. Inmates confined in disciplinary lockup, particularly in the Maximum Security Unit, have been held for\\nprolonged periods in close confinement. Exercise was limited to 15 minutes twice a week prior to the riot. Since\\nthat time all exercise was being denied as recently as the date of this trial. Sleeping accommodations consist of\\nmattresses placed directly on the floor or on a concrete slab. There were and are no beds. The cells are vermin\\ninfested. Lighting throughout the lockup areas was and is inadequate.\\n413 The isolation cells have the same dimensions and fixtures as other M.S.U. *413 cells. They are, however, sealed\\noff from the rest of the unit by a dividing wall. These isolation cells have only a small window or \\\"bean hole\\\" which\\ncan be closed to isolate the occupant completely and to seal out all light and ventilation. Such inmates receive no\\nexercise, reading material or any other form of recreation.\\nInmates who were sentenced to that form of disciplinary status officially referred to as \\\"72 hour detention,\\\" were\\ndeprived of food, clothing, bedding and necessary hygienic materials and confined in cells generally known and\\ncommonly referred to as \\\"hole\\\" cells. These are totally dark and stripped of all fixtures other than latrines and\\nfaucets. Penitentiary officials published rules for such \\\"72 hour detention,\\\" but there were no published\\ndepartmental policies governing the use of these \\\"hole\\\" cells. Confinement in these \\\"hole\\\" cells was discontinued\\nin the fall of 1972, pursuant to an unwritten administrative directive. The actual cells have been maintained and\\nremain available in substantially the same condition as before for future use at any time this or any subsequent\\nadministration so decides.\\nAdministrative Lockup\\n15. Prior to the riot, a large number of inmates were confined in administrative segregation on the top floor of the\\nwest cell house and on the top floor of the new cell house. Although some inmates were held in the administrative\\nsegregation areas for disciplinary punishment due to a lack of space in the maximum security unit, the majority\\nwere so held for a variety of reasons such as protection from other inmates, observation, investigation, awaiting\\ncourt action and pre-hearing detention. These inmates had been convicted of no infractions or offenses and had\\nbeen provided no hearings or other procedural safeguards. In spite of this, they were subjected to conditions of\\nconfinement which were punitive in nature. They were held in close confinement for prolonged periods with\\nminimal lighting and ventilation. They received no exercise. Their privileges were restricted and they were denied\\nthe oportunity to participate in the prison work programs, to earn work time or to engage in any self-improvement\\nprograms. They were not considered for trusty status or parole eligibility. Following the riot, administrative\\nsegregation as previously practiced was dispensed with. Instead, through the process of custody grading and the\\n24 hour lockdown, essentially the entire prison population is now confined in administrative segregation under\\nconditions which can still only be described as punitive. Inmates classified as \\\"maximum custody,\\\" are not\\nconfined in the maximum security unit, and the first floor of East Cellhouse although they have been provided no\\ndisciplinary hearings. Inmates classified as \\\"close custody\\\" are now confined on the second and third floors of\\nEast Cellhouse. Inmates classified \\\"medium custody\\\" are confined on the fourth floor of East Cellhouse and\\nthroughout the West Cellhouse. A limited number of medium security inmates who have work assignments are\\nalso housed on the first floor of New Cellhouse. Inmates with different custody grades received different\\ntreatment. Those maximum custody inmates assigned to the maximum security unit receive the fewest privileges.\\nAt the other extreme are the medium custody inmates who have been afforded work privileges.\\n\\nUse of Chemical Agents\\n16. The use of chemical mace and tear gas normally causes physical pain and discomfort and, on several\\noccasions appearing in this record, the use of such chemical agents has caused serious physical injury and even\\ndeath of inmates. Pursuant to his statutory authority, the Director of the Department of Corrections issued Policy\\nStatement No. 7302.1 dated January 4, 1973, regarding the use of force including chemical agents at all\\n414 Oklahoma Correctional Facilities. Under this policy, only such force was to be *414 employed as was reasonably\\nnecessary under all attendant circumstances. Definite guidelines for implementing the policy included the\\nfollowing:\\n(a) No person was to lay hands on a prisoner, except in self defense, to prevent an escape, to\\nprevent injury to persons or damage to property, or to quell a disturbance. In controlling or moving\\nan unruly prisoner, sufficient personnel were to be used to preclude the necessity for striking or\\ninflicting bodily injury. Gas was not to be used on an individual prisoner except to prevent serious\\ninjury or loss of life. Accordingly, physical force was not to be used to force compliance with rules\\nor regulations other than under the foregoing circumstances.\\n(b) When the use of force was necessary, it was to be exercised according to the priorities of force\\nand limited to the minimum degree necessary under the particular circumstances. When firepower\\nwas utilized, the aim would be to disable rather than to kill. The application of any or all of the\\npriorities of force listed below, or the application of a higher numbered priority without first\\nemploying a lowered numbered one, was dependent upon and required to be consistent with the\\nsituation encountered during any particular disorder. Priorities of force were:\\n1) Physical restraint;\\n2) Show of force;\\n3) Use of physical force other than weapons fire (Riot Squads);\\n4) Use of high pressure water;\\n5) Use of chemical agents;\\n6) Fire by selected marksmen;\\n7) Use of full fire power.\\nThe policy statement required that whenever a chemical agent was used on an inmate and/or\\ninmates, the Warden would immediately telephone the Director of the Department of Corrections\\nor, in his absence, the Deputy Director of Institutions. The telephonic report was to be followed by\\na written report containing all facts and circumstances concerning the incident.\\nNotwithstanding these directives, the wardens and other high-level officials at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\nMcAlester have approved or acquiesced in the use of chemical agents as a purely punitive measure against\\ninmates, including even inmates locked in their cells, in violation of the limitations imposed by the Department of\\nCorrections. Mace and tear gas have been used on inmates for such conduct as loud singing in cells, refusing to\\nget haircuts or to shave, possession of contraband (such as instant coffee) in cells, destruction of state property\\n(such as breaking plastic spoons), cursing an officer, talking in a loud voice or yelling, screaming for a doctor and\\nshaking or rattling cell doors. None of the incidents discussed above were shown to have presented any real or\\nimmediate threat to the security of the institution and certainly did not rise to the level of threatening serious injury\\nor loss of life. The Court finds as a fact that most, if not all, of these incidents were precisely the type of rules\\ninfractions concerning which the use of any type of physical force was intended to be prohibited by the\\ndepartmental policy statement. They were, rather, incidents that should have been dealt with officially, if at all, by\\nmeans of the use of the disciplinary system. Accordingly, it is clear that a pattern and practice exists of using\\nchemical agents against inmates when inadequate (if any) consideration was given by the officials involved to the\\n\\nthreshold question of whether a given situation warranted the use of any physical force at all, whether chemical\\nagents or otherwise.\\nChemical agents, such as mace and tear gas, have as an inherent characteristic the affecting of individuals other\\nthan those against whom they are specifically directed. This is a fact that has not been given adequate\\nconsideration by the defendants and their agents in determining whether such agents should be used in given\\n415 situations. The record reveals incidents in which these various *415 chemical agents were used against\\ndisorderly inmates under appropriate circumstances, but in excessive amounts. The Court finds that while the\\nuse of chemical agents was not wholly unjustified, the manner and extent of their use was improper.\\nThe record also reveals incidents in which chemical agents were used against specific individual inmates under\\ncircumstances justifying the use of physical force as a behavior control measure, but where other reasonable\\nmeans of controlling the behavior of the specific inmates existed and where the chemical agents could not be\\nused without visiting their effects on other, innocent inmates. The Court finds that the choice of chemical agents\\nas the behavior control device in such instances was not justified.\\nThe wardens and other high level officials at the penitentiary have routinely received reports of the improper use\\nof chemical agents by correctional officers, but have failed and refused to take any corrective action. The Director\\nof the Department of Corrections is either unaware of or condones the continued violations of the Department's\\npolicy, since the evidence of record reflects no action having been taken to seek to compel adherence to the\\nlimitations imposed by the Department's own regulations.\\nMedical Care\\n17. Defendants have maintained and operated a medical care delivery system at the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary which was and is incapable of providing, has failed to provide, and continues to fail to provide\\nadequate medical care for the inmates.\\nThe medical staff and facilities which are located at the main penitentiary at McAlester are relied upon to\\ndiagnose and treat the medical, dental and psychiatric problems of inmates throughout the penitentiary system.\\nPrior to the riot of July 27, 1973, the on-site medical staff, facilities, equipment and procedures at the Penitentiary\\nare systemically incapable of meeting the routine or emergency health care needs of the inmate population. This\\nfacility and the equipment and records it contained were destroyed during the riot. A temporary hospital ward has\\nbeen established in a former cellhouse and the security Captain's office is now used as an examination room.\\nPortions of the medical research facility adjacent to the penitentiary have also been converted to use as an\\nexamination area for trustees. It is obvious, however, that those inadequacies in plant and equipment which\\nexisted prior to the riot were aggravated by the riot and that no effective solution has been formulated.\\nProfessional dental care was supplied to the entire population by a series of part time dentists until July of 1973.\\nThough a full time dentist was hired at that time, no trained civilian support personnel have been hired to assist\\nhim. This level of dental staffing is unable to meet the routine dental care needs of the population intended to be\\nserved. Indeed, even if there were two dentists and they were provided minimal paradental support, they could\\nstill only be expected to treat 50 percent of the dental pathology involved.\\nThough approximately one half of the average in-patient population at the penitentiary is hospitalized for\\npsychiatric reasons, there is no professional psychiatric staff available for treatment on a regular basis. A visiting\\npsychiatrist makes weekly visits pursuant to an informal agreement, but he has not assumed responsibility for the\\ncare of these patients. The only \\\"treatment\\\" available at the penitentiary consists of temporary relief from\\n\\\"distress\\\" through sedation.\\nThe professional medical staff available to the inmate male population at the time of trial consisted of one fully\\nlicensed, part-time M.D., serving as chief medical officer, and two additional doctors who have institutional\\nlicenses which permit them to practice in state institutions, but only under the supervision of a fully licensed\\n416 physician. The *416 services of the institutional licensed physicians have been equally divided between health\\ncare of inmates and operation of the plasmaphersis program at the penitentiary so that the services of only one of\\n\\nthem are normally available at any given time. The actual services supplied by the chief medical officers have\\nvaried. The chief medical officer at the time of the riot was supplying full time services. Since his resignation, only\\npart-time services are provided by his successor, Dr. Karl Sauer, who also maintains an active, private\\northopedics practice in McAlester. Part of Dr. Sauer's time at the penitentiary is required to be spent on\\nadministrative matters.\\nFor many years, the penitentiary system has, for all practical purposes, been without any professionally trained\\nmedical support personnel whatsoever. Due to shortages in staff, defendants have continuously relied on\\nunlicensed, untrained and unqualified correctional officers and other penitentiary employees, as well as inmate\\npersonnel, to perform clinical and related medical services which should be performed solely by licensed and\\nqualified professionals. Such services performed by unqualified inmate and civilian personnel include, for\\nexample, screening medical complaints to determine which inmates on sick call will actually get to see a doctor,\\nas well as providing actual treatment and nursing care. Subsequent to the riot, defendants have placed even\\ngreater reliance on such unqualified personnel at the main facility where almost the entire inmate population was\\nbeing held on 24 hour lockdown as recently as the time of this trial. The lockdown has in fact seriously\\nexacerbated previously existing problems in the medical area.\\nDefendants have endeavored, both before and since the riot, to supply some medical services by referrals to\\nvarious outside facilities. This system of referrals, however, has failed to compensate for on-site deficiencies in\\nstaff and facilities and does not and cannot adequately meet the medical needs of the inmates.\\nThe past and present systemic medical deficiencies at O.S.P. have resulted in instances of actual impairment of\\ninmate health and continue to pose an actual and potential threat to the physical health and well-being of the\\nO.S.P. inmate population.\\nCorrespondence Rights\\n18. Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of arbitrary and unreasonable restriction, interruption and\\ndelay of mail to and from inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.\\nDefendants have unduly restricted the inmates' opportunity to conduct sealed or privileged correspondence with\\ncounsel, the courts and other governmental agencies. Incoming sealed correspondence has never been\\npermitted from any source and, until quite recently, all such incoming mail was opened and read. Outgoing\\nsealed correspondence with attorneys, other than the correspondent's single \\\"attorney of record,\\\" and to federal\\ncourts and government officials has also been denied privileged treatment, even after defendants purported to\\nrecognize limited \\\"privileged\\\" correspondence on or about February 2, 1973. Accordingly, at least some letters to\\nand from courts, attorneys and government agencies continued to be opened, read, copied, recorded, and/or\\nrejected. Furthermore, defendants' policy on privileged correspondence was never fully implemented. In apparent\\ncontravention of that policy, the established practice of officers in charge of the various lockup facilities at the\\npenitentiary was to deny any sealed correspondence privilege to their charges.\\nAn additional barrier to the confidentiality of such correspondence has been the failure to provide notary services\\nwithin the secured areas of the pentitentiary. Accordingly, legal documents which required notarization could not\\nbe sealed by the inmates, inasmuch as they were required to turn these matters in for notarizing, which was\\neffected outside their presence.\\n417 *417 At the supplemental pretrial conference held on December 6, 1973, counsel for the defendants tendered to\\nthe Court and opposing counsel a new Department of Corrections policy statement governing inmate\\ncorrespondence. Implementation of the policy statement was not undertaken until very recently and the record is\\nunclear as to the exact manner in which the new policy has been applied in practice. On its face the document\\npermits sealed out-going correspondence without restrictions. All incoming mail is still to be opened. Only\\ninspection for impermissible enclosures is expressly authorized, but reading is not actually prohibited. Any\\ninspection is required to be conducted in the presence of the inmate addressee, if the mail is from an attorney.\\nThis procedure is expressly extended to inmates on lockup or \\\"segregated\\\" status.\\n\\nUnder the new policy no privilege is recognized with respect to mail from courts and government officials. There\\nis no provision for solving the problem on confidentiality of outgoing mail requiring notarization. Moreover, any\\ninmate whom unidentified officials determine has violated \\\"certain imposed guidelines\\\" will apparently be reduced\\nto the limited opportunity to conduct sealed correspondence, as recognized under the old policy.\\nThe new mail policy also eliminates a number of restrictions formerly applied to unprivileged mail. Prior to and\\nduring most of the time this case has been pending, defendants severely restricted personal correspondence to\\nfive immediate family members, as approved by the penitentiary classification office. No other \\\"personal\\\"\\ncorrespondence was allowed. Mail of a non-personal nature was permitted, but only if the inmate's classification\\nofficer made a determination that the particular communication was of a \\\"business\\\" nature. No written rules or\\nguidelines defining \\\"business\\\" mail were ever established or made available either to the inmates or to the\\nemployees who were required to make such evaluations. In practice, classification officers exercised this\\nundefined authority in a manner that rejected letters to and from ministers, attorneys, government officials and\\nother similar correspondents.\\nUnder the new mail policy, inmates may not correspond with outside businesses or institutions for the purpose of\\nsoliciting catalogues, fee samples or educational material, or for the purpose of conducting their own business.\\nRegardless of purpose, they may not conduct any correspondence with persons known to them only through\\nnewspaper or magazine ads, or with persons in prison who are not immediate family members. There is a\\nseparate departmental policy statement governing the practice of religion which prohibits inmates from\\ncommunicating with ministers who are exconvicts.\\nIn addition to the foregoing expressed limitations, evidence in the record shows that certain inmates have not\\nbeen permitted to correspond with a San Francisco, California, prisoner aid group, believed by the inmates to be\\na possible source of legal services. There is no indication of change in defendants' continuous, but unwritten,\\npolicy of prohibiting correspondence of any kind in a foreign language.\\nAs indicated above the new policy authorizes inspection, but neither authorizes nor prohibits the reading of\\nincoming mail. On the other hand, there was never any express authority to read inmate mail under the prior\\npolicy. Nevertheless, the actual practice at the penitentiary routinely involved the reading of inmate mail for the\\npurpose of discovering and rejecting mail containing \\\"gossip\\\" and \\\"improper language.\\\" There was no expressed\\npolicy, purpose, direction or standards for such censorship, so the employees authorized to censor such mail did\\nso on an entirely subjective basis.\\nPublications\\n418 19. Defendants have in the past prohibited and continue to prohibit inmate *418 subscriptions to, receipt and/or\\npossession of certain magazines and newspapers.\\nIn the past, the official written rule was that subscriptions could be obtained to any periodicals on the approved\\nperiodical list. In fact, such a list did not exist. Decisions on individual requests to subscribe to various periodicals\\nwere made on a case-by-case basis, by penitentiary personnel, guided by essentially no promulgated standards\\nor procedures.\\nAfter the riot, a practice was instituted that prevented inmates from subscribing to any newspapers or periodicals.\\nQuite recently, there has actually been promulgated an approved periodicals list. As will be set forth in greater\\ndetail, this list still operates to exclude legal and religious periodicals. No procedure has been promulgated\\nwhereby inmates may seek to obtain approval for subscriptions to periodicals not on the approved list. In fact,\\nthey have been advised that all periodicals not on the list are contraband. The Court takes judicial notice that\\ninnumerable publications containing protected speech have not been included on the current approved list.\\n\\nAccess to the Courts\\n20. The defendants have failed to provide an adequate law library or any reasonably and adequate alternative\\nthereto. The library, such as it is, is located in a wood frame shelter attached to the wall of the main rotunda.\\nBecause of its size, approximately ten feet by six feet, only two or, at most, three inmates can use the facility at\\nany one time. The facility is so lacking in legal reference books and publications as to constitute no library at all.\\nFor example there are no reports of decisions by the United States Supreme Court or lower Federal Courts.\\nInmates are prohibited from assisting one another on legal matters and in preparing their legal papers since such\\nassistance may permissibly be provided only by a law librarian. In practice, penitentiary officials have also\\nfollowed a policy of preventing inmates from acquiring legal books. In addition, inmates have been and are now\\nprohibited from subscribing to any legal periodicals and have been denied the right to have in their possession\\nany personal legal materials or other assets belonging to them and acquired for the purpose of working on their\\nlegal problems, although the latter prohibition has recently been relaxed.\\nFor extended periods of time, the law library has been closed to inmates because no librarian was available. It is\\nnoted that during the year 1973, except for approximately six weeks, no law librarian was employed by the\\npenitentiary. During such periods an inmate could use the library only if a classification officer was available to\\naccompany him and to and open the library for him. Approximately 15 percent of the inmate population is illiterate\\nand the sixth or seventh grade average reading ability of the population is less than that which is required for\\neffective use of the more common legal reference materials. As is noted above, only the institutional \\\"law\\nlibrarian\\\" may permissibly assist these and other inmates on legal matters. The use of the term \\\"law librarian\\\" is\\nmisleading since no librarian employed by the penitentiary has had any legal training. When such a librarian has\\nbeen available he has been able to assist only three or five inmates per day. Inmates frequently must wait up to\\nfive weeks to receive assistance, if it is available at all. Inmates on lockup, regardless of the length of\\nconfinement, are prohibited from using the law library. They are only provided with legal forms which may be\\nused to file petitions with the courts. Male inmates from subsidiary facilities must request transfers to the main\\nfacility at McAlester in order to use the library facilities. Women inmates are afforded no library privileges and\\nmust depend upon visits from the law librarian, when one is employed and is available. Recently a new employee\\n419 was hired to perform the functions *419 of a law librarian. This employee is classified as a correctional officer I,\\nbut due to illness, has been unavailable for some time. It is heartening to note from the record that the\\ndefendants have made plans for upgrading the law library facilities, employing a full-time attorney and engaging\\nthe services of law students to provide legal assistance to inmates. However, such plans have not as yet been\\nimplemented and the conditions mentioned above still prevail.\\nReligious Freedom\\n21. Inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary who follow the Muslim faith do not, because of their religious\\nbeliefs, eat pork or any food mixed with pork or pork by-products. Said inmates have on numerous occasions\\npetitioned penitentiary officials to provide them with pork free meals. Penitentiary officials have refused and still\\nrefuse to provide the pork free meals so requested. Defendants have failed to provide special diets, even when\\nrequested by the medical staff for medical patients, and nutritional analyses of penitentiary menus show that\\nthere are vitamin and protein deficiencies in the diet generally provided inmates.\\nIt is common knowledge that many meals are prepared with pork or pork by-products. However, the Court cannot\\ndetermine with specificity, from the menus placed in the record, the extent to which pork or pork by-products are\\nused in the food now served to the inmates. Of course, pork served in its natural state is easily discernible, but\\nmeals seasoned with pork are often difficult of detection. The record is devoid of any evidence indicating that\\ninmates are advised of foods actually prepared with pork or pork by-products. It naturally follows that those\\ninmates whose religious beliefs prevent the eating of pork in any form, are often forced either to chance that the\\nfood they eat is free of pork or to refuse the food altogether. Because of the dietary deficiencies found to exist in\\nthe regular meals now being prepared and served to all inmates, the Court finds that inmates who follow the\\nMuslim teachings cannot obtain an adequate diet by foregoing the eating of food prepared with pork and will, if\\n\\nthey attempt to follow the tenets of their faith, receive a diet even more deficient than that received by other\\nprisoners.\\nMuslim inmates have also been deprived of the oppportunity to gather together for group religious services. It is\\nunclear for what periods this condition prevailed prior to the riot, since there is evidence in the record that some\\narrangement for such meetings had been made through the auspices of the Catholic Chaplain. Subsequent to\\nthe riot, there has been a total ban on group religious services regardless of denomination. This prohibition\\nappears to have had a greater impact on the Muslims, because such services provide their only opportunity for\\nreligious guidance. Protestants and Catholics at the penitentiary have at least the services of a civilian chaplain\\nwith whom individual consultations may be arranged however brief or unsatisfactory they may be.\\nReligious periodicals have not been included on the various official and unofficial approved periodical lists that\\nhave been in effect at the penitentiary at diverse times. Moreover, Muslim publications entitled \\\"Elijah Muhammad\\nSpeaks\\\" and \\\"The Message to the Black Man in America\\\" have been and are specifically prohibited by a\\ndepartmental policy statement dated April 25, 1968. No factual justification for the exclusion of these two specific\\npublications is shown. Likewise, no justification whatsoever is shown for the failure to include religious\\npublications generally on the various approved periodicals lists.\\nMembers of the Muslim sect at McAlester have earnestly urged this Court that their religious principles have been\\noffended by their integration with non-Muslim inmates. For the reasons set forth in the Court's discussion of racial\\nintegration this aspect of the Muslim complaint will not be honored and must be rejected.\\n420 *420 It is also claimed that none of the guards presently employed at the penitentiary are followers of Muslim\\nfaith. The Court has no reason to doubt this assertion, but finds no evidence that this condition has been the\\nresult of or has resulted in any direct or covert discrimination based upon religion or race.\\nFinally, the Muslim plaintiffs have complained that following the July 27 riot, they were locked up because of their\\nreligious beliefs. The Court notes that the entire population at McAlester was and continues to be locked up\\nunder punitive conditions which it finds deplorable. There is, however, no evidence that Muslims, because of their\\nbeliefs, have been subjected to conditions or restrictions more punitive than other inmates of the Penitentiary.\\nPrior Findings of this Court\\nThe trial in this case was heard on March 14, and 15, 1973, following a series of individual pro se cases\\npresented to the court during the week of March 11. At the close of this trial, the Court entered a series of\\npreliminary findings which dealt in general terms with the numerous unconstitutional conditions and practices\\nwhich have been described in greater detail herein. The Court further found from the totality of the record, that\\nplaintiff as well as the other inmates at McAlester are entitled to such injunctive and mandatory relief, as is\\nnecessary to correct the deprivations of rights which have occurred in the past and will continue unless enjoined\\nby order of this Court.\\nThe requests for additional relief were, however, denied because of evidence of contributing fault on the part of\\ninmates. Accordingly, it was and is the determination of this Court that the record does not support the award of\\nmoney damages to any prisoner nor is there evidence which would warrant the release of any prisoner from\\nconfinement prior to serving his full sentence.\\nConclusions of Law\\nJurisdiction\\n1. This Court has jurisdiction of this case. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1343(3) & (4).\\n2. The Attorney General of the United States was authorized to intervene in this action on behalf of the United\\nStates pursuant to Section 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000h-2.\\n\\n3. \\\"Federal courts sit not to supervise prisons but to enforce the constitutional rights of all `persons,' which\\ninclude prisoners. We are not unmindful that prison officials must be accorded latitude in the administration of\\nprison affairs, and that prisoners necessarily are subject to appropriate rules and regulations. But persons in\\nprison, like other individuals, have the right to petition that Government for redress of grievances.\\\" Cruz v.\\nBeto, 405 U.S. 319, 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 1081, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972). While federal courts are \\\"reluctant to\\nintervene in matters of prison administration,\\\" Hoggro v. Pontesso, 456 F.2d 917 (C.A. 10, 1972), the record in\\nthis case has led this Court to conclude that the defendants have been and are operating the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary in a manner which violates many rights secured to inmates by the Constitution and laws of the\\nUnited States. \\\"[A] policy of judicial restraint cannot encompass any failure to take cognizance of valid\\nconstitutional claims whether arising in a federal or state institution. When a prison regulation or practice offends\\na fundamental constitutional guarantee, federal courts will discharge their duty to protect constitutional rights. \\nJohnson v.

Sigler, 327 F.Supp. 829 (D.Neb.1971) aff'd, 456 F. 2d 1266 (C.A. 8, 1972) (per\\ncuriam).\\n5. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits racial discrimination in any aspect of\\nprison administration. Privileges must be afforded equally to prisoners of all races. Rivers v. Royster, 360 F.2d\\n592 (C.A. 4, 1966); Jackson v. Godwin, 400 F.2d 529 (C.A. 5, 1968); Owens v. Brierley, 452 F.2d 640 (C.A. 3,\\n1971). Specifically, prison officials may not discriminate on the basis of race when making job assignments or\\nadministering discipline. Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881, 901 (N.D.Miss., 1972) (appeal\\npending).\\n6. The present cessation of segregation in inmate housing coming subsequent to the filing of a lawsuit due to\\nemergency conditions beyond defendants' control is insufficient grounds upon which to conclude there is \\\"no\\nreasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.\\\" N.

Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed.\\n1303 (1953).\\nIn light of the prolonged practice of segregation prior to the riot in contravention of stated policy, and because of\\nthe uncertainty of post-riot conditions and the importance of the rights at stake, judicial relief continues to be both\\nappropriate and necessary. Rowe v. General Motors Corp., 457 F.2d 348 (C. A. 5, 1972); United States v. West\\nPeachtree Tenth Corp., 437 F.2d 221, 228 (C.A. 5, 1971).\\nProcedural Due Process\\n7. The due process clause proscribes any serious disciplinary sanctions against an inmate unless he is found to\\nhave violated written rules which are adequately promulgated prior to the commission of the infraction charged\\nand which describe punishable conduct with reasonable precision. Sinclair v. Henderson, 331 F.Supp. 1123\\n(E.D.La.1971); Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss. 1972) (appeal pending).\\n8. Summary punishment is unconstitutional; serious disciplinary sanctions may not be imposed on inmates\\nwithout a hearing. Inmates who are charged with infractions must be given official written notice of the specific\\ncharges against them. This notice must be given a reasonable time prior to conducting the hearing. Sinclair v.\\n\\nHenderson, supra; Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971); Nolan v. Scafati, 430 F.2d 548 (C.A. 1, 1970)\\n; Landman v. Royster, 333 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Va.1971); see also, Black v. Warden, 467 F.2d 202 (C.A. 10, 1972).\\n9. The determination to impose serious disciplinary sanctions on prisoners must be made by an impartial\\ndecision-maker Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971), cert. denied sub nom. Sostre v. Oswald, 404\\nU.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972).\\n10. The impartial disciplinary tribunal may not in effect abdicate sentencing responsibility by permitting line\\nofficers to determine the length of confinement. Accordingly, a denial of procedural due process results where\\nindefinite lockup sentences are imposed without a regular, meaningful and independent review reasonably\\ndesigned to enable the disciplinary tribunal or some other responsible disinterested administrative official or body\\n422 to make its own *422 determination regarding duration of confinement.\\nSee, Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973); Gray v. Creamer, 465 F.2d 179 (C.A. 3, 1972); United\\nStates ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, 467 F.2d 51 (C.A. 2, 1972).\\n11. The imposition of significant additional restrictions or sanctions on inmates who have already been placed on\\ndisciplinary lockup requires the same procedural safeguards as apply at the time of the original punishment. \\nAdams v. Carlson, supra; Palmigiano v. Baxter, 487 F.2d 1280, 1284-1285 (C.A. 1, 1973).\\n12. Automatic detention of inmates prior to disciplinary hearings can result in a denial of procedural due process.\\nWhether awaiting institutional or judicial proceedings or both, such inmates should be segregated only if a\\nreasonable basis exists therefore (e. g., their continued presence in general population status poses an actual\\nthreat to the security of the institution) and then only for a reasonable time until the disciplinary committee can\\nconvene to hear the case. The pre-riot practice at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary of having the disciplinary\\ncommittee meet weekly is not an adequate one for this purpose. Such hearings must be held as soon as is\\npracticable under the circumstances. Absent unusual and reasonably sufficient extenuating circumstances,\\nprehearing detention in excess of 48 hours (72 hours if a weekend intervenes) is presumptively unreasonable. \\nLandman v. Royster, 354 F.Supp. 1292, 1294 (E. D.Va.1973).\\n13. Even where the confinement of an inmate under punitive conditions is denominated and processed as an\\nadministrative, rather than a disciplinary matter, the indefinite confinement of inmates under such conditions,\\nwithout standards or criteria, and without minimal procedural safeguards, violates the due process clause of the\\nFourteenth Amendment. United States ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, D.C., 338 F.Supp. 311, affirmed, 467 F.2d 51\\n(C.A. 2, 1973); Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973); Gray v. Creamer, 465 F.2d 179 (C.A. 3, 1973); \\nHoward v. Smyth, 365 F.2d 428 (C.A. 4, 1966); Diamond v. Thompson, 364 F.Supp. 659 (M.D.Ala.1973); Allen v.\\nNelson, 354 F.Supp. 505 (N.D.Cal.1973); Bowers v. Smith, 353 F.Supp. 1339 (D.Vt.1972).\\nCruel and Unusual Punishment\\na. In General\\n14. The prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment is applicable to the State of\\nOklahoma through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660,\\n82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962).\\n15. It is established that the Eighth Amendment does not have fixed, settled and definite limits. The \\\"Amendment\\nmust draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\\\" \\nTrop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). This Court subscribes to the view\\nof the Eighth Circuit:\\n\\\"In summary, then so far as the Supreme Court decisions are concerned, we have a flat\\nrecognition that the limits of the Eighth Amendment's proscription are not easily or exactly defined,\\nand we also have clear indications that the applicable standards are flexible, that disproportion,\\nboth among punishments and between punishment and crime, is a factor to be considered, and\\n\\nthat broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency are useful\\nand usable.\\\"\\nJackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 579 (C.A. 8, 1968). In short, the parameters of the constitutional prohibition are\\nnot rigidly defined and are, in effect, discernible only in the context of specific factual situations.\\n423 16. \\\"Cruel and unusual punishment may be inflicted by the unconscionable *423 penalty imposed by statute or by\\nthe inhumane execution of a permissible penalty imposed under a constitutionally permissible statute.\\\" Bethea v.\\nCrouse, 417 F.2d 504, 507-508 (C.A. 10, 1969). While the great majority of cases involving the Eighth\\nAmendment have involved one or more specific acts directed at selected individuals (e. g., Trop v. Dulles, supra),\\nthe constitutional prohibition is equally applicable to general conditions of confinement. Holt v. Sarver, 309\\nF.Supp. 362, 372-373 (E.D. Ark.1970), aff'd 442 F.2d 304 (C.A. 8, 1971); Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621\\n(E.D.Va.1971); Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss.1972) (appeal pending).\\nb. Use of Chemical Agents\\n17. Chemical mace and tear gas inevitably inflict physical pain and discomfort upon, and can cause permanent\\nphysical injury and even death to the individual(s) against whom they are used. Accordingly, the use of such\\nchemical agents to punish inmates constitutes a form of corporal punishment.\\n18. At least in a State such as Oklahoma where State law clearly proscribes the use of corporal punishment, Title\\n57 O.S.A. \\u00a7 31, the use of corporal punishment on inmates is also cruel and unusual within the meaning of the\\nEighth Amendment.\\n19. Whether or not proscribed by State law, the use of chemical agents such as mace or tear gas as a punitive\\nmeasure rather than a control device results in the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the\\nEighth Amendment. Landman v. Royster, 333 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Va.1971). See also Morales v. Turman, 364\\nF.Supp. 166, 173 (E.D.Tex.1973) (involving Texas juvenile detention facilities).\\n20. That chemical agents have been used as a punitive measure may be inferred from evidence showing that\\nsuch agents are employed unnecessarily (i. e., without proper justification based on a reasonable concern for the\\nsecurity of the institution) or with justification, but in excessive amounts. See Landman v. Royster, supra.\\n21. The established pattern of unreasonable and excessive use of chemical agents at the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary has resulted in summary, as well as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and\\nFourteenth Amendments.\\nc. Conditions of Confinement\\n22. Solitary confinement per se does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661\\n(C.A. 5, 1971); Graham v. Willingham, 384 F.2d 367 (C.A. 10, 1967). Such confinement may constitute cruel and\\nunusual punishment, however, if it is maintained in a manner fairly characterized as foul, inhuman and violative of\\nbasic concepts of human decency, Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 526 (C.A. 2, 1967). In most of the cases in\\nwhich the conditions in solitary confinement have been condemned, the inmates were held in dark cells where\\npersonal hygiene was impossible due to the lack of materials necessary for personal sanitation and/or the\\ninability to properly dispose of body waste. See e. g., LaReau v. MacDougall, 473 F.2d 974 (C.A. 2, 1972) cert.\\ndenied, 414 U.S. 878, 94 S.Ct. 49, 38 L.Ed.2d 123 (1973); Wright v. McMann, supra; Hancock v. Avery, 301\\nF.Supp. 786 (M.D.Tenn. 1969); Jordan v. Fitzharris, 257 F. Supp. 674 (N.D.Cal.1966). Such conditions have\\nprevailed in the subterranean isolation area referred to as \\\"the hole.\\\" The conditions found to exist in the isolation\\ncells in the maximum security unit approach, but do not, standing alone, reach the level of cruel and unusual\\npunishment. Nevertheless, confinement in dark, unventilated and unsanitary isolation cells without any means of\\nmental or emotional diversion if imposed for prolonged periods will result in conditions which equal cruel and\\nunusual punishment. See, Morales v. Turman, 364 F.Supp. 166 (E.D.Tex.1973). Cf. Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661,\\n424 671 (C.A. 5, *424 1971) (partial dissenting opinion); Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971) cert. denied\\nsub nom. Sostre v. Oswald, 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972).\\n\\n23. Prisoners held in segregation for security or other non-disciplinary reasons must be provided as many of the\\nprivileges enjoyed by the general population as the nature of their confinement allows. Landman v. Royster, 354\\nF.Supp. 1292, 1294-1295 (E.D.Va. 1973); Allen v. Nelson, supra.\\n24. Where inmates are confined to their cells for periods up to one year and subjected to continual and enforced\\nidleness without affording them any opportunities for physical exercise, voluntary work, or educational programs,\\nit must be concluded that such conditions of confinement constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of\\nthe Eighth Amendment. Hamilton v. Love, 328 F.Supp. 1182 (E.D.Ark., 1971); Sinclair v. Henderson, 331 F. Supp.\\n1123 (E.D.La.1971); cf.Osborn v. Manson, 359 F.Supp. 1107 (D.Conn. 1973).\\nd. Denial of Medical Care\\n25. Inmates have a basic right to receive needed medical care while they are confined in prison. Edwards v.\\nDuncan, 355 F.2d 993 (C.A. 4, 1966); Coppinger v. Townsend, 398 F.2d 392 (C. A. 10, 1968); Schack v. Florida,\\n391 F. 2d 593 (C.A. 5, 1968), cert. denied, 392 U.S. 916, 88 S.Ct. 2080, 20 L.Ed.2d 1376 (1968); Martinez v.\\nMancusi, 443 F.2d 921 (C.A. 2, 1970); Sawyer v. Sigler, 320 F.Supp. 690 (D.Neb.1970), aff'd 445 F.2d 818 (C.A.\\n8, 1971).\\n26. As a necessary corollary of that right, prison officials have an affirmative duty to make available to inmates a\\nlevel of medical care which is reasonably designed to meet the routine and emergency health care needs of\\ninmates. Fitzke v. Shappell, 468 F.2d 1072 (C.A. 6, 1972); Campbell v. Beto, 460 F.2d 765 (C.A. 5, 1972); Gates\\nand United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss.1972) (appeal pending); Newman v. Alabama, 349\\nF.Supp 278 (M.D.Ala.1972) (appeal pending); cf.Jones v. Wittenberg, 330 F.Supp. 707 (N.D.Ohio, 1971) affirmed\\nsub nom. Jones v. Metzer, 456 F.2d 854 (C.A. 6, 1972); Chapman v. Gilligan, No. 8700 (S.D.Ohio, March 16,\\n1973). While a prisoner is not entitled to the medical care of his choice, Coppinger v. Townsend, supra, Judge\\nDaugherty has held that \\\"a failure to provide needed medical care by one having custody of a prisoner may under\\ncertain circumstances afford a prisoner a cause of action under Civil Rights Act.\\\" (Elsberry v. Haynes, 256\\nF.Supp. 738 (W.D.Okl.1966).\\n27. The actionable circumstances result where, as here, the level of medical care available to a confined and\\ndependent population is inadequate to meet predictable health care needs because of obvious and sustained\\ndeficiencies in professional staff, facilities and equipment. When continued and systemic deficiencies of this\\nnature exist and have resulted in the actual impairment of inmate health, and when such deficiencies continue to\\npose a current and potential threat to the physical health and wellbeing of an entire prison population, then\\ninmates are deprived of the basic elements of adequate medical treatment in violation of the Eighth Amendment,\\nCampbell v. Beto, supra, and are also subjected to disabilities beyond those contemplated by incarceration, in\\nviolation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Fritzke v. Shappell, supra.\\nCorrespondence and Publication\\n28. Inmates have a preferred constitutional right to correspond with attorneys, courts and government officials for\\nthe purpose of petitioning government and the courts for the redress of grievances. LeVier v. Woodson, 443 F.2d\\n360 (C.A. 10, 1971); Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971) cert. denied sub nom. Sostre v. Oswald,\\n425 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972); Palmigiano v. Travisono, *425 317 F.Supp. 776 (D.R.I.1970)\\n. The confidentiality of such correspondence may not be arbitrarily denied by prison officials, who are the likely\\nsubjects of an inmate's grievances. Defendants' practice of limiting confidential treatment to correspondence with\\none attorney, state courts and state government officials, but not with their federal counterparts, constitutes an\\narbitrary and unreasonable intrusion upon the inmates' right freely to petition their government and the courts.\\nSee, Palmigiano v. Travisono, supra.\\n29. This Court does not conclude that prison officials may not regulate or restrict forms of prisoner mail. Because\\nof its impact on the First Amendment rights of \\\"freeworld\\\" as well as inmate correspondents, however, the\\ncensorship of such mail must meet the constitutional standards which are generally applied to governmental\\n\\nregulation of protected speech. Accordingly, it must be shown that prison mail censorship furthers an important\\ngovernmental interest unrelated to the suppression of speech and that the mode of censorship results in\\nlimitations which are no greater than are necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental\\ninterest involved. Procunier v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___, 94 S. Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); United States v.\\nO'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). Prison mail regulations which automatically limit\\ninmates to personal correspondence with a fixed number of immediate family members work an arbitrary and\\nunconstitutional prior restraint on the protected speech of both inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents.\\nSuch overly broad restrictions have been imposed on inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary solely to serve\\nthe administrative convenience of the defendants, without furthering any demonstrated interest in the orderly\\noperation of the institution or the rehabilitation of its inmates. Procunier v. Martinez, supra; Morales v. Schmidt,\\n489 F.2d 1335 (C. A. 7, January 17, 1973) (rehearing en banc, May 29, 1973, 494 F.2d 85); LeMon v. Zelker, 358\\nF.Supp. 554 (S.D.N.Y. 1972).\\n30. Defendants' policy of intercepting, censoring and rejecting incoming and outgoing inmate correspondence\\nbased on unwritten and/or ill-defined prohibitions against \\\"improper language\\\" or \\\"gossip\\\" including \\\"false\\nstatements to any correspondents\\\" is overbroad on its face and has in fact been applied in such a manner as to\\ninfringe upon the protected speech of inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents. Procunier v. Martinez, supra;\\nAdams v. Carlson, 352 F.Supp. 882 (E.D.Ill.1973) reversed in part on other grounds, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973);\\ncf.LeMon v. Zelker, supra; Palmigiano v. Travisono, supra.\\n31. Whether based upon the identity or characteristics of the correspondents (as in the case of approved list\\nrestrictions), or upon the content of their specific communications (such as \\\"gossip\\\" and \\\"improper language\\\"),\\nthe restriction and/or censorship of prison mail deprives both inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents of the\\n\\\"liberty\\\" of free speech. Accordingly, due process requires that the determination to censor must be based on\\nfacts rationally determined pursuant to such procedures as are necessary to insure fairness. Such minimum\\nprocedural safeguards include notice to the interested correspondent(s) and a reasonable opportunity to protest\\nthe decision of a prison official other than the person who originally disapproved the correspondence. Martinez v.\\nProcunier, D.C., 354 F.Supp. 1092, affirmed, Procunier v. Martinez, supra.\\n32. Restrictions on the free flow of information to prison inmates in the form of general circulation newspapers\\nand magazines results in a denial of the First Amendment rights of such inmates, unless the State can show that\\n426 such restrictions are reasonably necessary to the preservation of security, good order or discipline within the *426\\npenitentiary or the rehabilitation of the inmates. Fortune Society v. McGinnis, 319 F.Supp. 901 (S.D.N.Y.1970); \\nLaaman v. Hancock, 351 F.Supp. 1265 (D. N.H.1972). The past and present restrictive practices of the\\ndefendants, pertaining to the acquisition and retention of general circulation newspapers and magazines have\\ngone far beyond any possible legitimate needs based on the preservation of security, good order or discipline\\nwithin the penitentiary or the rehabilitation of the inmates. Such rules that have existed and such practices as\\nhave been in effect have been arbitrary and capricious on their face and as applied. The legitimate interest of\\ninmates in having access to the information, both social and educational, to be found in these various types of\\nperiodicals far outweighs any legitimate interest of penal administration or any proper regard to be afforded the\\nexpertise and discretionary authority of competent correctional officials. When prison officials conclude that\\neffective security, good order or rehabilitation require the censorship of such material, then with respect to each\\nobjectionable publication, the basis for the determination, including a written notice setting forth the relevant facts\\nwith respect to the particular publication, shall be provided to each inmate who seeks to obtain it. Such inmates\\nshall be provided a reasonable opportunity to submit additional facts and views to the decision maker before such\\ndetermination becomes final. Laaman, supra; Sostre v. Otis, 330 F.Supp. 941 (S.D.N.Y.1971); See Procunier v.\\nMartinez, supra. If it is possible to do so without defeating the purpose of the proposed exclusion, the inmate\\nshould be allowed to examine the allegedly offensive material and set forth reasons in writing as to why he feels it\\nshould not be excluded. In any event, the actual, final decision to exclude a specific issue of any general\\ncirculation publication shall be made by the Warden or Deputy Warden, who shall prepare and retain on file a\\ndetailed statement of the specific basis for each such exclusion for any jurisdictional court review.\\n\\nAccess To The Courts\\n33. Prisoners, no less than other persons, have a constitutional right of access to the courts. Johnson v. Avery,\\n393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L. Ed.2d 718 (1969). \\\"`Regulations and practices that unjustifiably obstruct the\\navailability of professional representation or other aspects of the right of access to the courts are invalid.' Ex parte\\nHull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L. Ed.2d 1034 (1941).\\\" Procunier v. Martinez, supra.\\n34. To be meaningful, the right of access to the courts must include the means to frame and present legal issues\\nand relevant facts effectively for judicial consideration.\\n35. Because the state has substantial control over the activities of convicted prisoners and because many\\nprisoners are indigent and poorly educated, prison officials have an affirmative constitutional duty to provide them\\nwith the necessary means for obtaining access to courts.\\nPrison law libraries are a basic means of assisting inmates to that end. Gilmore v. Lynch, 319 F.Supp. 105 (N.D.\\nCal.1970), affirmed, Younger v. Gilmore, 404 U.S. 15, 92 S.Ct. 250, 30 L.Ed.2d 142 (1971); Hooks v. Wainwright,\\n352 F. Supp. 163 (M.D.Fla.1972). The defendants have, at various times and in various ways, attempted to\\nprovide some form of legal assistance to inmates. The Court concludes however that the law library and legal\\nassistance program at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary have failed to provide these disadvantaged inmates with\\nconstitutionally adequate access to the courts. Johnson v. Avery supra; Gilmore v. Lynch, supra; Hooks v.\\nWainwright, supra.\\n\\\"The constitutional guarantee of due process of law has as a corollary the requirement that\\n427 prisoners be afforded access to the courts in order to *427 challenge unlawful convictions and to\\nseek redress for violations of their constitutional rights.\\\"\\nProcunier v. Martinez, supra. (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the requirement levied on\\nthe State of Oklahoma in this area of constitutional application extends to insuring adequate access to the courts\\nregarding at least habeas corpus actions, civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 and out-of-time appeals. Cf.\\nJustice After Trial: Prisoners' Need for Legal Services in the Criminal Correctional Process, 18 Kan.L.Rev. 493\\n(1970).\\n36. A state may not prohibit inmate self-help or mutual inmate assistance in legal matters unless it provides them\\nwith some reasonable, alternative means of protecting their right of access to the courts. Johnson v. Avery, supra.\\nDefendants in this case have unconstitutionally interfered with inmates' protected attempts to obtain timely,\\neffective access to the courts in numerous ways. This unconstitutional interference has extended to attempts by\\ninmates to seek and receive the assistance of attorneys, Procunier v. Martinez, supra; to acquire, retain and use\\npersonal legal materials such as law books, legal periodicals, and such other assets as are used in the course of\\nworking on one's personal legal problems, Cruz v. Hauck, 404 U.S. 59, 92 S.Ct. 313, 30 L.Ed.2d 217 (1971),\\nAdams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973), and to assist one another in the preparation of legal documents\\nin the absence of a constitutionally adequate alternative. Johnson v. Avery, supra; See also, Procunier v.\\nMartinez, supra.\\nReligious Freedom\\n37. Where the precepts of a religious sect call for its adherents to engage in a religious practice which does not\\npresent a threat to the security, discipline and good order of the institution, the state has the burden of justifying\\npolicies or practices which prevent such inmates from engaging in such religious practices. See, Cooper v. Pate,\\n378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1964); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263\\n(1972); Long v. Parker, 390 F.2d 816 (C.A. 3, 1968); Brown v. Peyton, 437 F.2d 1228 (C.A. 4, 1971).\\n38. The court finds no valid justification for defendants continuing policy of denying inmates including Muslims the\\nopportunity to gather together for corporate religious services. Walker v. Blackwell, 411 F.2d 23 (C.A. 5, 1969); \\n\\nLong v. Parker, 390 F.2d 816; Northern v. Nelson, 315 F.Supp. 687 (N.D.Cal.1970); affirmed, 448 F.2d 1266 (C.A.\\n9, 1971); Banks v. Havener, 234 F.Supp. 27 (E.D.Va.1964); Williford v. California, 352 F.2d 474 (C.A. 9, 1965).\\n39. In the instant case, the defendants have not offered any justification to support their food distribution practices\\nwhich prevent Muslim inmates from adhering to their religious practice of abstaining from the consumption of pork\\nand pork by-products. Such practices cannot be squared with the First Amendment rights of the inmates and, on\\nthe basis of the record in this case, are an unconstitutional application of state power. See, Barnett v. Rodgers,\\n133 U.S.App.D.C. 296, 410 F.2d 995 (1969).\\n40. In order to justify a proscription against religious publications, including Muslim literature, officials have the\\nburden of showing that such publications present a threat to security, discipline and good order within the\\ninstitution that cannot otherwise be overcome. Rowland v. Jones, 452 F.2d 1005 (C.A. 8, 1971); Brown v. Peyton,\\nsupra; Long v. Parker, supra. In the instant case no such showing has been made with respect to the prohibited\\npublications entitled \\\"Message to the Black Man\\\" and \\\"Muhammad Speaks.\\\"\\nRelief\\n41. It is within the authority and is indeed the responsibility of this court to order that all violations of federal\\n428 constitutional and civil rights, *428 and of rights and privileges secured by the laws, regulations and policies of\\nthe State of Oklahoma, cease forthwith. The Court is loath to consider the necessity of closing the Oklahoma\\nState Penitentiary at McAlester as a direct or indirect result of its orders. Inmates v. Eisanstadt, 360 F.Supp. 676,\\n691 (D. Mass.1973) affirmed, 494 F.2d 1196 (C. A. 1, 1974); Cf.Hamilton v. Love, 328 F.Supp. 1182, 1194\\n(E.D.Ark.1971). Notwithstanding the grossly offensive conditions and treatment of inmates found to exist at the\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester, it is also within the authority of this Court to refrain, in its discretion,\\nfrom entering at this time any order that would require or have the effect of requiring the closing of the\\npenitentiary. The Court concludes that, at this time, the interests of all parties to the case and the public interest\\nwould be best served by the Court affording the authorities of the State of Oklahoma and of the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary the opportunity to bring conditions and treatment of inmates at the penitentiary into conformity with\\nthe requirements of the United States Constitution, federal civil rights laws, and the laws, regulations and policies\\nof the State of Oklahoma.\\nJUDGMENT, DECREE, INJUNCTION AND ORDER FOR REMEDIAL\\nACTION\\nIn accordance with the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth above, and because of the determination\\nby the Court that it is necessary for an order to issue in this case and to be in effect during the time that may be\\nnecessary for the formulation, approval and implementation of plans for complete relief, it is\\nOrdered that the defendants, their officers, agents, servants, employees and all other persons in active concert or\\nparticipation with them, and all their successors in office, who receive actual or constructive notice of this Order\\nby personal service or otherwise as hereinafter provided, are hereby enjoined from operating the facilities of the\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary McAlester, Oklahoma, in any manner inconsistent with the following provision of this\\nOrder:\\nOrder on Racial Segregation and Discrimination\\n1. Racial discrimination in any aspect of the operations of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary shall cease forthwith\\nand forever.\\n2. All future cell or other housing assignments at the penitentiary, whether initial or subsequent, shall be made in\\naccordance with a classification and assignment system in which the race of the inmate is not a factor\\nconsidered. All requests by inmates for transfers from one cell or other housing assignment to another shall also\\nbe processed and decided without regard for the race of the inmate making the transfer request.\\n\\nIn order to insure that the mandates set forth in this paragraph are not allowed to operate so as to perpetuate\\nsegregation or facilitate resegregation, the warden shall set as a goal that all major housing units (cell blocks,\\ndormitories, runs, etc.) should generally approximate in their respective racial compositions the racial composition\\nof the inmate population as a whole. This is not to be an inflexible rule, as legitimate considerations within the\\noperating scope of a valid, non-racially biased classification and assignment system may well produce some\\nimbalances in this regard. The warden shall, however, on a quarterly basis, report to the Director of the\\n[*]\\nDepartment of Corrections, with copies to all counsel of record in this case,  a detailed justification for each\\nmajor housing unit that deviates more than 10% in either direction in the racial composition of its population from\\nthe racial composition of the inmate population as a whole.\\n429 *429 The warden of the penitentiary shall insure that there is no segregation within major housing units of the\\npenitentiary.\\n3. All inmates shall have an equal opportunity to be considered fairly for assignment to and advancement within\\nall jobs that are or may become available at the penitentiary. To assist in insuring that this is achieved, no\\npreference shall be given in future job assignments on the basis of any inmate's previous work experience at the\\npenitentiary, where such preference would have a racially discriminatory effect. Validly applicable work\\nexperience prior to entering the penitentiary and any relevant formal education or training may of course be\\nconsidered.\\n4. Records will hereafter be maintained at the penitentiary which will include the identity of the person(s) making\\neach initial or subsequent job or housing assignment and the basis for such assignment. If the previous practice\\nof assigning inmates only to departments or industries for work is reinstituted, with the specific job assignments\\nbeing made within the gaining department or industry, the records of the penitentiary shall include this same\\ninformation regarding each job assignment or reassignment within each department or industry. If there are job\\npromotions available to inmates, the records concerning each promotion actually effected shall include the\\nreason(s) why the promoted inmate was selected and the name(s) of the other inmate(s) considered for that\\npromotion.\\n5. Affirmative action to overcome the effects of past discrimination in the operation of housing, dining and\\nrecreational facilities, job assignments and the disciplinary system shall be formulated and implemented.\\nConceding that certain of these operations are either not carried on at the present time, or are carried on at a\\nlevel far below that which was in effect prior to July 27, 1973, it must nonetheless be recognized that the\\nrestoration of normal operations at the penitentiary could present the grave likelihood of the past pattern and\\npractice of pervasive racial discrimination being restored as well.\\nThe defendants shall, within 60 days from the date of this Order, formulate and submit to counsel for the plaintiffs\\nand the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the court for consideration and approval, their plan for the total\\neradication of any present segregation and other forms of racial discrimination, for overcoming the continuing\\npresent effects of segregation and other forms of racial discrimination as heretofore practiced at the Oklahoma\\nState Penitentiary, and for precluding the reinstitution of any discriminatory practices which were in effect prior to\\nJuly 27, 1973.\\nThe plan so submitted shall include, but not be limited to, provisions for the on-going examination of all operating\\nprocedures within the penitentiary for possible discriminatory effects; provisions for training present and future\\nstaff in the area of human relations, and the timetable for conducting such training; provisions for effective\\nstatistical and other checks and reviews at the administration level within the penitentiary; and provisions for\\nadditional checks and reviews within the Department of Corrections.\\nThe plan so submitted shall also include the details of a procedure for the review and analysis of records\\nmaintained pursuant to paragraph 4 of this order. To overcome the effects of past discrimination in job\\nassignments, the plan will also include a requirement, as to any specific job category wherein the racial\\ncomposition of the inmate group assigned to that job category deviates more than 10% in either direction from\\nthe racial composition of the inmate population as a whole, that a detailed justification for each such deviation be\\n\\nprepared on a quarterly basis. Such justifications shall be submitted over the signature of the warden of the\\npenitentiary to the director of the Department of Corrections and to all counsel of record in this case.\\n430 *430 To insure the eradication of discrimination in the operation of the penitentiary disciplinary system, the plan\\nshall also include provision for appropriate training for all individuals who prepare, investigate, review or process\\ninmate disciplinary reports, as well as all individuals who sit on or review the results of the proceedings of\\ndisciplinary committees, and all individuals who review, approve or consider appeals from the results of such\\ndisciplinary proceedings.\\nOrder of Procedural Due Process\\n6. The Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pertaining to this subject make it indisputably clear that the\\ndisciplinary system as it existed and exists at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary has failed to meet constitutional\\nrequirements in almost every possible regard. Nonetheless, the Court is not unmindful of the disparate views that\\nexist among judges, penologists and experts as to precisely what quantum of process is \\\"due\\\" in all of the\\ndifferent kinds of disciplinary proceedings that necessarily go on in a penitentiary. A similar disparity of views\\nexists with regard to many of the administrative decisions that must be made in the ordinary course of prison\\nadministration, but which can have serious effects on the inmates concerned. The Court is firmly of the opinion\\nthat the best disciplinary system is one that is universal, in the sense of being carefully constructed to deal\\nappropriately, but nonetheless fairly, with all of the varying kinds and degrees of offenses and rules infractions\\nthat can be and are committed in this or any other penitentiary. The same is true with regard to the administrative\\ndecision-making process by means of which significant administrative decisions affecting inmates are made.\\n7. Accordingly, the Court will make no effort at this time to prescribe a complete set of rules and regulations\\nregarding procedural due process, or even to provide detailed guidelines as to what would constitute an\\nappropriate and constitutional disciplinary system for the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, nor will it do so regarding\\nthose aspects of the penitentiary's administrative decision-making process that have led to constitutional\\nviolations in the past. If it is possible to do so, it is far preferable for those provisions necessary to overcome past\\nconstitutional deficiencies to be fashioned as part of an organic whole 00 that is, of a comprehensive system.\\n97\\n8. In the course of the preparation for and presentation of this case, counsel for the plaintiffs, the plaintiff-\\nintervenor and the defendants have gained a possibly unique perception of the problems herein involved. The\\nCourt therefore directs counsel for the parties to confer and attempt in good faith and in a spirit of cooperation to\\nfashion a detailed, comprehensive disciplinary system for the penitentiary system to which all parties can agree in\\na submission to the Court. The Court further directs counsel so to confer regarding the administrative mechanism\\n(s) by means of which decisions are made that significantly impinge upon the rights, interest, welfare and\\nrehabilitative potential of the inmates of the penitentiary. Even if total agreement concerning these matters is not\\npromptly achieved, the Court directs that counsel persist in their efforts and insure that as much as possible is\\nworked out through the process of negotiation and agreement. The final product of this undertaking will be\\nsubmitted to the Court for consideration and approval not more than 60 days from the date of this decree, and will\\nbe accompanied by (if necessary) submissions on behalf of each party regarding those points concerning which\\nagreement has not been possible and constitutional interests are involved.\\n9. The purpose of the Court in promulgating the foregoing portion of its decree is to attempt to insure that the\\ndisciplinary system and the administrative decision-making machinery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary are\\nconstitutional in all respects, but are at the same time adequate to fulfill the real needs of discipline and\\n431 administration *431 within the penitentiary. These goals are not mutually exclusive.\\n10. In the interim, the following rules shall apply:\\na. No inmate shall be disciplined in any manner except for violation of a written rule, promulgated\\nprior to the commission of the offense charged, which, in general terms at least, was adequate to\\nhave given the inmate reasonable notice that the conduct subsequently alleged as the basis for\\nthe charge could constitute a punishable act; this does not, of course, require that every possible\\n\\nset of facts that could be charged must be set forth with particularity, but it does prohibit punishing\\nan inmate for conduct that he did not reasonably know could be the basis for punishment;\\nb. No summary punishment shall be inflicted, although this does not preclude a correctional officer\\nfrom reprimanding or warning an inmate that repetition or continuation of particular conduct could\\nor will result in a disciplinary charge being filed;\\nc. Inmates charged with infractions must be given official written notice of the charges against\\nthem and, in reasonably specific terms, the conduct that formed the basis for the charge, said\\nnotice to be given a reasonable time prior to any hearing that must or may be held on such\\ncharges;\\nd. No written charge shall be disposed of nor significant disciplinary sanction imposed on any\\ninmate without a hearing at which the inmate is accorded a reasonable opportunity to be heard\\nand to present his defense to, explanation of, or matters in mitigation regarding the charge(s)\\nagainst him;\\ne. The members of the disciplinary hearing shall be impartial; as a minimum, no person who was\\ninvolved in bringing, investigating or processing any charge shall sit on the panel that determines\\nthe guilt of the inmate of that charge or the punishment, if any, to be imposed as a result.\\nf. Disciplinary charges against inmates shall be disposed of, by hearing or otherwise, as soon as\\npracticable and such disposition shall not be delayed pending possible action in the civil courts\\nconcerning the same or related matters.\\ng. If disciplinary sanctions are imposed that include indefinite terms in lockup, disciplinary\\nsegregation, etc., there shall be a review of the need for the continuation of such status on a\\nregular basis, either by the disciplinary panel that imposed the sanction, by an alternate or\\namended panel the members of which are impartial as defined above, or by a high-ranking,\\ndisinterested administrative official at the penitentiary; no correctional officer performing duty in\\nthe lockup area where the inmate is confined shall participate in the process of deciding whether\\ncontinued confinement is warranted, except that he may make such reports as to the inmate's\\nbehavior as are routinely required by penitentiary regulations and may make recommendations,\\nwith reasons therefor, as to whether continued confinement is so warranted;\\nh. Inmates on disciplinary lockup shall not be subjected to significant additional restrictions or\\nsanctions except in accordance with a procedure that comports with the requirements of\\nparagraph 10 a-f, supra.\\ni. Inmates who allegedly commit offenses or other rules infractions shall not be placed in pre-\\nhearing detention unless a reasonable basis exists therefor, such as the fact that their continued\\npresence in general population poses an actual threat to the security of the institution; absent\\nunusual and sufficient circumstances, pre-hearing detention in excess of 48 hours (72 hours if a\\nweekend is involved) shall be presumptive evidence of a violation of paragraph 10 f of this Order;\\nand\\nj. To insure that no inmate is punished in violation of the provisions of this paragraph through a\\n432 process of *432 denominating the procedure employed \\\"administrative,\\\" rather than \\\"disciplinary\\\"\\nin nature, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply generally to any administrative action to be\\ntaken that could result in the inmate being confined under punitive conditions; if an inmate is\\nplaced in administrative segregation pending investigation of serious charges against him, the\\nreview process required by paragraph 10 g shall insure that the investigation is being conducted\\nwith all practicable expedition, or the inmate shall be released from such status.\\n\\nOrder on Conditions of Confinement\\n11. Any future use of that form of disciplinary status which was known officially as \\\"72 hour detention\\\" and which\\ninvolved confinement in the subterranean isolation area commonly known as \\\"the hole\\\" is prohibited.\\n12. Effective immediately, before any inmate is confined in an isolation cell in the Maximum Security Unit,\\ncompliance with the procedures of paragraph 10, supra, is required.\\nWithin 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall submit to counsel for the plaintiff and the plaintiff-\\nintervenor for comment, and to the court for consideration and approval, a proposed set of comprehensive\\nregulations intended to govern future confinement in the isolation cells in the Maximum Security Unit. These\\nproposed regulations shall set forth the conditions and treatment to be provided inmates confined in such cells\\nand a maximum time limit for the duration of such confinement. Prior to submitting these proposed regulations to\\nthe Court, the defendants shall have said regulations reviewed by competent medical authorities, not employed\\nby or connected with the Department of Corrections, who shall also inspect the isolation cells themselves. No\\nproposed set of regulations shall be submitted to the Court that is not accompanied by a statement from said\\nmedical authorities to the effect that confinement in these cells, under the conditions included in the proposed\\nregulations and found to exist at the time the cells are inspected by said medical authorities, under the treatment\\nprocedures called for in the proposed regulations, and for the maximum duration provided for in the proposed\\nregulations, does not constitute an unreasonable risk to the physical or psychological well-being of an inmate so\\nconfined.\\n13. Inmates who are confined in any form of administrative segregation shall be accorded as many of the\\nprivileges enjoyed by general population inmates, to the extent enjoyed by those inmates, as the nature and\\npurpose of their confinement in administrative segregation will allow. This provision applies, notwithstanding the\\nfact of compliance, where appropriate, with the provisions of paragraph 10, supra.\\n14. All inmates shall be afforded a reasonable time outside their cells, daily, for the purpose of exercise or other\\nform of recreation. This provision shall be effective 10 days from the date of this decree. Weather permitting,\\ngeneral population inmates shall be allowed outdoors during at least part of this exercise period. If at all possible,\\ninmates in administrative segregation and disciplinary segregation shall also be allowed outdoors for this\\npurpose.\\n15. Within 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall cause to be made a study of the actual diet\\nbeing furnished to the inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. This study shall be conducted by an individual\\n(s) qualified in the areas of diet and nutrition. The results of this study shall be submitted in the form of a report to\\nthe Court, with copies to counsel for the plaintiff and the plaintiff-intervenor, and shall cover at least the caloric\\nand nutritional adequacy of said diet. The report shall also address itself to the specific question of whether\\nMuslim inmates are receiving the opportunity to be adequately fed (in terms of both calories and nutrition),\\nwithout having to eat items prepared with pork or pork by-products.\\n433 *433 16. Until other programs for the useful and constructive occupation of the general population are instituted\\nor resumed, defendants shall undertake to provide inmates with all practicable means for mental diversion and/or\\nself-improvement while confined to their cells.\\nThis portion of the Court's decree could be satisfied by offering inmates an opportunity to participate in \\\"cell\\nstudy\\\" programs, similar to those offered to invalid students in other state institutions.\\nOrder on Use of Chemical Agents\\n17. The unjustified use of chemical agents against inmates is prohibited. They shall not be used against\\nindividual inmates, or against small groups of them, except as authorized by the policy statement of the\\nOklahoma State Department of Corrections dated January 4, 1973. To support the use of this form of physical\\nforce, the requirement of that policy statement that there be an actual and imminent threat of death or bodily\\n\\nharm must be present. Chemical agents may also be used to quell an actual or incipient riot involving a large\\nnumber of unconfined inmates, where there is present an actual and imminent threat of death or bodily harm, or\\nan actual and imminent threat of serious damage to or the destruction of property which is substantial in quantity\\nand/or value. They may also be used to thwart the imminent escape of an inmate or inmates.\\n18. Whenever chemical agents are used against an inmate or inmates, all reasonable precautions shall be taken\\nto avoid or minimize inflicting the effects thereof on innocent inmates.\\n19. Chemical agents shall not be used to enforce silence or otherwise to enforce the rules and regulations of the\\npenitentiary, unless the conditions set forth in paragraph 17 are present. It will be an exceptional situation in\\nwhich the use of these agents can be justified against an inmate locked in his cell. Even where a large number of\\ninmates locked in their cells are involved in a disturbance, chemical agents shall not be used if they are merely\\nnoisy, or shaking the doors of their cells (so long as the doors remain secure), or because of anything they may\\nsay to or shout at any member of the penitentiary staff. These and similar rules infractions on the part of inmates\\nare properly dealt with by means of the penitentiary disciplinary system, with due process safeguards, rather than\\nsummarily.\\n20. As is the case with any use of physical force against inmates, the use of chemical agents must never exceed\\nthat reasonably required to effect the legitimate ends of penitentiary officials. Accordingly, the use of chemical\\nagents against inmates, on the rationale that the actual situation is one which could develop into 00 although it has\\n97\\nnot yet become 00 one in which the use of such agents is permitted, constitutes the excessive use of physical\\n97\\nforce and is prohibited both by the departmental policy statement of January 4, 1973, and by this Order.\\n21. Every incident involving the use of any chemical agent against any one or more inmates shall be reported in\\nwriting by the warden to the director, with copies to all counsel of record in this case, within three days of the\\nincident until further order of the Court. A full and complete statement of all relevant circumstances shall be\\nincluded in such reports. If, in the opinion of the warden, further investigation is required, he shall denominate the\\nreport an interim report and shall submit a final report when the entire investigation is completed, but not less\\nthan ten days after the incident. Any justified modification of the factual statement set forth in the interim report\\nshall be included in this final report.\\n22. Within the parameters delineated by this Order, there remains great scope for the proper exercise of\\njudgment and sound discretion on the part of penitentiary officials. The proper exercise of such judgment and\\n434 discretion should not be superseded by any Court and will not *434 be by this one. The contrary proposition is\\nequally necessary, however; the unconstitutional use of chemical agents against inmates can neither be\\npermitted nor condoned. What the Court has condemned in this Order is not the use of chemical agents in\\nsituations where the use of physical force against inmates is justified, but where reasonable men might differ on\\nthe kind or degree of necessary force. The Court has condemned the use of chemical agents in situations where\\nthe use of any physical force is unjustified.\\nOrder on Medical Care\\n23. Within 60 days from the date of this Order, the defendants shall formulate a comprehensive plan for providing\\nconstitutionally adequate routine and emergency medical care (including psychiatric care) to all inmates at the\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary. This plan shall be submitted to counsel for the plaintiffs and for the plaintiff-\\nintervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval.\\n24. This plan shall include, but need not be limited to, the provisions necessary for the operation of an in-patient\\nmedical facility within the secured area of the penitentiary (or in such close proximity thereto that security\\nconsiderations will not unreasonably delay the receipt of needed medical care by inmates in the security area).\\nThis in-patient facility shall comply in its operating procedures, staffing, equipment and physical plant with the\\nregulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Health governing the licensure of hospitals and related\\ninstitutions, or with some other set of comprehensive standards generally accepted within the medical profession.\\nThe staffing provisions of the plan shall provide as a minimum:\\n\\na. nursing care 24 hours a day, seven days a week;\\nb. a full-time Chief Medical Officer;\\nc. the equivalent of one additional full-time doctor;\\nd. an adequate support staff of qualified generalist or specialist medical para-professionals;\\ne. such additional dental and dental support staff as will bring dental care in the penitentiary\\nsystem to an acceptable level; and\\nf. a designated staff member to be responsible for insuring that adequate in-patient psychiatric\\ncare and treatment are provided.\\nThe plan shall also specify the extent to which medical facilities and personnel outside the penitentiary system\\nare being relied upon to provide medical care for inmates and the specific means by which such outside care will\\nbe secured. Also included will be appropriate provisions pertaining to the control, storage, handling and\\ndistribution of all medications.\\n25. Pending the formulation, approval and implementation of such plan, the defendants shall insure that each\\ninmate who goes on sick call is seen by a medical doctor or by a fully-qualified health para-professional (e. g.,\\nphysician's assistant, medical technician, etc.). No individual member of the staff or inmate population who is not\\na fully-qualified health professional or para-professional shall inhibit, prevent or obstruct any inmate from going\\non sick call.\\nOrder on Correspondence and Publications\\n26. The confidentiality of any inmate's outgoing correspondence to any attorney, court, or government official or\\nagency shall not be abridged. This provision is specifically applicable to mail to be sent to any court which is\\nrequired by that court to be notarized. Incoming correspondence from any of these sources may be opened and\\ninspected for contraband, but only in the presence of the inmate-addressee, and may not be delayed or read.\\n435 27. With respect to all other correspondence to and from inmates of the *435 penitentiary system, the Court has\\npreviously noted with approval the recent, significant improvement in defendants' policies. Within 60 days from\\nthe date of this decree, defendants shall submit whatever modifications of their existing policies, specific\\npractices or operating procedures in this area are deemed by them to be required or warranted in the light of the\\nprovisions of Conclusions of Law 29-31, inclusive, supra, or the recent decision of the United States Supreme\\nCourt in the case of Procunier v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974). Such shall be\\nsubmitted, together with a written presentation of their unmodified policies, practices and operating procedures in\\nthe form of a single, proposed comprehensive regulation for consideration and approval by the Court. Copies of\\nthis submission shall also be sent to counsel for the plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment. No inmate,\\nwhether enjoying unrestricted or restricted correspondence status under defendants' existing policy statement,\\nshall be subjected to any arbitrary limitations on the number of approved correspondents, the identity thereof, etc.\\n28. With respect to general circulation publications, such as newspapers and magazines, a comprehensive\\nregulation, consistent with all aspects of Conclusion of Law 32, supra, shall be submitted within 60 days from the\\ndate of this decree, to counsel for the plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for\\nconsideration and approval. This plan shall include all of the necessary and reasonable rules with which an\\ninmate must comply in order to subscribe to any such general circulation publication. It shall also include those\\ndetailed internal operating procedures necessary to insure that any present, continuing effects of past arbitrary\\nand capricious practices in this area are overcome.\\n29. No decision shall be made to exclude any publication except as may be required by the needs of security,\\ngood order, or rehabilitation; nor shall any such decision be made by any penitentiary official other than the\\nWarden or Deputy Warden, and then only after full compliance with the applicable provisions of Conclusion of\\nLaw 32, supra, regarding notice, opportunity to submit additional facts, etc. Any decision to exclude shall be\\n\\nmade solely on the basis of the content of the specific publication in question and the official actually making the\\ndecision shall prepare and retain on file a detailed statement of the specific basis for each such exclusion.\\nOrder on Access to the Courts\\n30. Within 60 days from the date of this Order, the defendants shall prepare and submit to counsel for the plaintiff\\nand plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval, a comprehensive plan for\\ninsuring that inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary have adequate and effective access to the Courts. The\\nplan shall consider and address the problem of reasonable access in terms of habeas corpus petitions, \\u00a7 1983\\nand other civil rights matters, out-of-time appeals, and such other matters as are addressed more particularly in\\nthe Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, supra. In order to insure that effective access is available\\nthroughout the penitentiary system, appropriate consideration shall be given to the number of inmates in the\\npenitentiary system, the fact of their geographic dispersion, the anticipated number of requests for post-\\nconviction legal assistance, and the educational level of the overall inmate population.\\n31. Pending the information, approval and implementation of such a plan, the defendants shall forthwith refrain\\nfrom interfering with the acquisition or possession by inmates of legal materials, including transcripts, lawbooks,\\nlegal periodicals, paper, etc. They shall also arrange for capable and experienced inmates to be allowed to help\\n436 those who require assistance in order to be able effectively to frame and present legal issues *436 and relevant\\nfacts for judicial consideration.\\n32. The defendants shall forthwith advise all inmates that they are permitted to subscribe to any legal periodical\\nand to seek to obtain lawbooks and legal assistance by mail. The defendants shall insure that the inmates\\nunderstand that they are permitted to purchase and possess legal periodicals and books specifically dealing with\\nthe legal problems of inmates and that they are authorized to write to organizations concentrating on such\\nproblems in an effort to obtain legal assistance, reference materials, etc.\\nOrder on Religious Freedom\\n33. Defendants shall forthwith cease all unreasonable interference with the provision to inmates of spiritual\\ncounselling and the opportunity to engage in group religious services.\\n34. Defendant shall forthwith advise all inmates of the penitentiary system that they may subscribe to and receive\\nreligious publications, including books, newspapers and magazines, unless any such publication demonstrably\\npresents a threat to security, discipline and good order within the institution that cannot otherwise be overcome.\\nMuslim inmates shall forthwith be advised specifically that the above authority to subscribe to and receive\\nreligious publications extends to the publications entitled \\\"Message to the Black Man\\\" and \\\"Muhammad Speaks.\\\"\\nThey shall also be advised of every food item served to the inmates of the penitentiary that is known or believed\\nby the defendants to contain pork or pork by-products.\\n35. Within 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall advise the Court, in writing, with copies to\\ncounsel for plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor, of the progress to date and of all future plans for providing religious\\ncounselling and group services, and of the fact of compliance with the remaining provisions of this portion of the\\nCourt's decree.\\nOrder on Security and Staffing\\n36. The Court has found that there were and are serious deficiencies in the level of overall security within the\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary. In different ways, this involves the security of the institution itself, the personal\\nsecurity of the members of the staff and the inmates who, as wards of the state, are entitled to and indeed must\\nlook to the state to reasonably insure their safety. The Court has further found that these security deficiencies are\\nin large measure due to both a serious shortage of staff at the penitentiary and to a very high turnover among\\nstaff members. Many of the unconstitutional conditions and practices that exist at the pentitentiary (or which\\n\\nexisted in the recent past and have present continuing effects) cannot be corrected without a considerable\\nimprovement in these areas of security and staffing.\\n37. Accordingly, counsel for the defendants shall, within 60 days of the date of this Order, submit to counsel for\\nthe plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval, a plan for\\neffecting promptly all necessary improvement in the areas of security and staffing.\\n38. In the interim, the defendants are advised that alleged shortages of staff shall not be deemed to constitute an\\nacceptable reason for the failure to comply fully with any provision of this decree. Unless specifically provided to\\nthe contrary herein, alleged security considerations shall also be deemed not to constitute an acceptable reason\\nfor the failure to comply fully with any provision of this decree.\\nOrder on General Provisions\\n39. Certain difficulties that arose in the course of the trial of this case would have been more readily resolved if\\npermanent records had previously been maintained of inmate housing assignments, by cell-block and cell,\\n437 beginning with each inmate's initial assignment *437 and showing the inclusive dates of it and all subsequent\\nassignments. Furthermore, compliance with certain provisions of this decree will be more readily determined if\\nsuch records are maintained. Accordingly, the defendants are directed to annotate the permanent records kept on\\neach inmate with his present housing assignment and to insure that subsequent assignments are also recorded\\ntherein.\\n40. Counsel for plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor will have access at all reasonable times to such records as are\\nmaintained concerning penitentiary inmates, whether or not required to be kept by this decree. They shall also\\nhave unimpeded access to individual inmates at all reasonable times for purposes of conducting interviews to\\nascertain whether there has been compliance with all provisions of this decree. Counsel for plaintiff-intervenor\\nare specifically authorized to utilize Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for these purposes.\\n41. If any of the defendants shall have any doubt or question as to the meaning, scope or application of any\\nprovision of this decree, the inquiry shall be submitted to the Court in writing in a communication from counsel for\\nthe defendant(s). The responsive communication from the Court will also be in writing. Copies of all such\\ncommunications shall be placed in the file of this case and concurrently served upon counsel for the plaintiffs and\\nplaintiff-intervenor. The same procedure shall apply to any such inquiries that may be deemed necessary by\\ncounsel for the plaintiffs or the plaintiff-intervenor.\\nThe defendants are charged with the duty of fully explaining the terms of this decree to all of their agents,\\nservants, representatives and employees, including penitentiary staff, guards and other personnel, and to assure\\ntheir understanding of the court's requirements and the necessity for strict compliance therewith.\\n42.

As litigants raising\\\\nthese constitutional issues, Plaintiffs were required by Illinois Supreme Court Rule 19 to serve notice\\\\nof their Complaint on Attorney General.   To Defendant\\u2019s knowledge, Plaintiffs have not done so to\\\\ndate.   A copy of Defendant\\u2019s February 13, 2007 letter notice to the Illinois Attorney General\\\\nproviding the requisite Rule 19 notice is attached as Exhibit A to this motion. \\\\nA. In support of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, Defendant states as follows:\\\\n1.  This action was commenced in the Circuit Court for the Tenth Judicial Circuit,\\\\nPutnam County, Illinois on December 20, 2006.   Plaintiffs\\u2019 Complaint asserts that the method\\\\nprescribed by state law for electing members of Defendant\\u2019s Board of Education has deprived them\\\\nof equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\\\\nConstitution. \\\\nThe Complaint also asserts that the Illinois School Code provisions in question violate Article III,\\\\nSection 3 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, which states that \\u201c[a]ll elections shall be free and equal.\\u201d\\\\n   2.   Defendant removed the action to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1441(b) and 1446\\\\non January 12, 2007.   Subject matter jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1331 in light of the\\\\nfederal questions presented, and under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1367(a) with respect to the related state claims. \\\\n3.   The Complaint alleges that pertinent parts of Article 9 of the Illinois School Code \\u2013 and\\\\nin particular, the section thereof which provides that all voters in certain multi-township school\\\\ndistricts shall elect all seven members of the board of education, but restricts the membership of the\\\\nboard to a maximum of three members residing in any single township \\u2013 violates the principle of\\\\n\\u201cone person, one vote\\u201d as applied to Plaintiffs and other residents of Township 32N, R1W, pleaded\\\\n\\u2013 2 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 3 of 13 \\\\nto be the majority population township in Defendant District 535.   See Complaint paragraphs 9\\\\nthrough 12.   (Although not specifically cited by Plaintiffs in their Complaint, this provision is found\\\\nin \\u00a7 9-12 of the School Code at 105 ILCS 5/9-12 and more specifically, in Ballot Format 4 set out\\\\ntherein and applicable to District 535.) 4.   The Complaint also alleges that this law unconstitutionally crimps the opportunity of\\\\nwould-be candidates residing in the majority population township to be elected to the school board. \\\\n5.   Plaintiffs\\u2019 Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to\\\\nstate any claim on which relief can be granted, in that controlling case law refutes both of the above\\\\npropositions. \\\\n6.   \\u201c[A]s a general rule, whenever a state or local government decides to elect persons by\\\\npopular election to perform governmental functions,  the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\\\\nAmendment requires that each qualified voter must be given an equal opportunity to participate in\\\\nthe election, and when members of an elected body are chosen from separate districts, each district\\\\nmust be established on a basis that will ensure, as far as practicable, that equal numbers of voters can\\\\nvote for proportionally equal numbers of officials.\\u201d  Hadley v. Junior Coll. Dist., 397 U.S. 50, 56,\\\\n90 S.Ct. 791, 795 (1970) (emphasis added) (holding that the \\u201cone man, one vote\\u201d principle applied\\\\nto the election of the defendant college district\\u2019s trustees). \\\\n    7.   However, as the Hadley Court went on to state, this holding did not inhibit states from\\\\nfinding ways to ensure that legitimate political goals of representation are achieved.  \\u201cWe have\\\\npreviously upheld against constitutional challenge an election scheme that required that candidates\\\\nbe residents of certain districts that did not contain equal numbers of people.   Dusch v. Davis, 387\\\\n\\u2013 3 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 4 of 13 \\\\nU.S. 112, 87 S.Ct. 1554 (1967).   Since all the officials in that case were elected at large, the right of\\\\neach voter was given equal treatment.\\u201d  Hadley, 397 U.S. at 58,  90 S.Ct. at 796. \\\\n8.   Dusch v. Davis disposes of Plaintiffs\\u2019 one person, one vote argument in this case.  In\\\\nDusch, the Court rejected an Equal Protection Clause challenge to a so-called \\u201cSeven-Four Plan\\u201d for\\\\nelecting members of the Virginia Beach City Council.   Under that plan, each of the 11 council\\\\nmembers was elected by a vote of all the electors in the City.   Four members were elected at large\\\\nwithout regard to residence.    Each of the remaining seven council members had to reside in the\\\\nborough from which he or she was elected. \\\\n9.    Delivering the opinion of the Dusch Court, Justice Douglas explained why this residence\\\\nrequirement was constitutionally unobjectionable: \\u201cIn upholding a residence requirement for the\\\\nelection of state senators from a multi-district county we said in Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433,\\\\n85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 201:  \\u2018 It is not accurate to treat a senator from a multi-district county\\\\nas the representative of only that district within the county wherein he resides.   The statute uses\\\\ndistricts in multi-district counties merely as the basis of residence for candidates, not for voting or\\\\nrepresentation.   Each district\\u2019s senator must be a resident of that district, but since his tenure depends\\\\nupon the county-wide electorate he must be vigilant to serve the interests of all the people in the\\\\ncounty, and not merely those of people in this home district; thus in fact he is the county\\u2019s and not\\\\nmerely the district\\u2019s senator.\\u2019\\u201d  Dusch v. Davis, 387 U.S. at 115, 87 S.Ct. at 1555-56. \\\\n10.   Likewise in this case, it is not accurate to treat a school board member elected by all the\\\\nvoters of a district of multiple congressional townships, as the representative of only that township\\\\nin which the board member resides.   Each school board member must be attentive to the needs and\\\\ninterests of the entire district electorate which votes the board member into (or out of) office. \\\\n\\u2013 4 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 5 of 13 \\\\n11.   Plaintiffs\\u2019 claim that the School Code provisions at issue violate their Fourteenth\\\\nAmendment rights as voters fails to state a claim, in light of the Supreme Court\\u2019s decision in Dusch\\\\nv. Davis, handed down nearly 40 years ago and cited and followed in many lower court cases.  See,\\\\ne.g., La Port County Republic Cent. Comm., 43 F.3d 1126, 1129 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding that\\\\nresidence districts need not have identical \\u201cor even similar\\u201d populations because voters may cast\\\\nballots for each of three county board positions, and affirming dismissal of suit on the pleadings);\\\\nHurlbut v. Scheetz, 804 F.2d 462 (8th Cir. 1986) (approving election system requiring at-large voting\\\\nin school board elections in sparsely populated North Dakota district, including restriction that\\\\nballots group candidates by residence and that one candidate be elected from each of five geographic\\\\nareas:  \\u201c[p]reserving distinct viewpoints of scattered geographical areas within a single governmental\\\\nentity has been recognized by the Supreme Court [in Dusch] as a sufficient justification for use of\\\\ngeographic residency requirements in conjunction with an at an-large voting scheme\\u201d);  Jt. Sch. Dist.\\\\nNo. 2 v. State Appeal Bd., 83 Wis.2d 711, 726, 266 N.W.2d 375, 381-82 (S.Ct. Wis. 1978) (electing\\\\none board member from each of nine former elementary school districts,  reorganized with a union\\\\nhigh school into a K-12 district, did not unconstitutionally \\u201cdilute\\u201d votes of residents in more\\\\npopulous districts: under Dusch, voting districts of unequal population are permissible if board is\\\\nelected at large and member of board represents the entire district);  Goldblatt v. City of Dallas, 414\\\\nF.2d 774, 775-76 (1969) (\\u201cappellant wisely does not contend that the Dallas \\u2018six-three\\u2019 city council\\\\nelection structure is unconstitutional per se\\u201d, the Supreme Court having specifically approved an\\\\nanalogous plan in Dusch: the one man-one vote principle is automatically complied with because\\\\nall votes are equal in a city-wide election). \\\\n\\u2013 5 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 6 of 13 \\\\n12.   Plaintiffs also assert that the residency restrictions in the challenged School Code\\\\nprovisions violate their Fourteenth Amendment rights as would-be candidates for the Board of\\\\nEducation.   They contend the law is fatally flawed in that, as pleaded in paragraph 10 of the\\\\nComplaint, it \\u201cprohibits plaintiffs and other similarly situated residents of Township 32N, R1W\\\\n...from being elected to said board despite having received more votes than residents of other\\\\ntownships in said District\\u201d. \\\\n13.    This assertion, too, fails to state a claim and should be dismissed pursuant to F.R.Civ.P.\\\\n12(b)(6).   Under the case law cited above, and to paraphrase Goldblatt v. City of Dallas, 414 F.2d\\\\nat 776, the possibility that a particular resident candidate wins in his township but loses district-wide\\\\ndoes not amount to discrimination against either the candidate or against the voters of that township:\\\\n\\u201cThe election is [district]-wide, and the elected official is a representative of the entire [district], not\\\\nmerely of a particular [township].\\u201d\\\\n14.   Even if the residency requirement were to be viewed as a species of ballot access\\\\nrestriction  \\u2013  which it is not, there being no limit to the number of Township 32N, R1W residents\\\\nwho may vie for such of the total three school board seats \\u201creserved\\u201d for them as may be open in any\\\\ngiven school board election \\u2013 the State\\u2019s interest in fostering geographic diversity on school boards\\\\nof large, multi-township districts is sufficient to justify the calibrated limitations reflected in the\\\\nprovisions of School Code \\u00a7 9-12.    \\\\n15.   Courts evaluate ballot access restrictions under a flexible standard that weighs the\\\\n\\u201c\\u2018character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth\\\\nAmendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate\\u2019 against \\u2018the precise interests put forward by the\\\\nState as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,\\u2019 taking into consideration \\u2018the extent to\\\\n\\u2013 6 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 7 of 13 \\\\nwhich those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff\\u2019s rights.\\u2019\\u201d  Lee v. Keith, 463 F.3d 763,\\\\n768  (7th Cir. 2006), quoting Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059 (1992), quoting\\\\nin turn Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 at 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564 (1983).    \\u201cUnder this standard,\\\\nthe rigorousness of...inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to\\\\nwhich a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\\u201d  Burdick, 504 U.S.\\\\nat 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059.   Restrictions that severely burden the exercise of constitutional rights must\\\\nbe narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance (such as education, see\\\\nFumarolo v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 142 Ill.2d 54, 566 N.E.2d 1283, 1299 (1990)), whereas\\\\n\\u201creasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\\u201d that impose less substantial burdens are generally\\\\njustified by the state\\u2019s \\u201cimportant regulatory interests\\u201d.   Id.    \\\\n16.   Unlike Illinois\\u2019 demanding ballot access rules struck down in Lee v. Keith, which in\\\\ncombination made it well-nigh impossible for independent candidates to run for election to the State\\\\nlegislature,  the electoral method objected to by Plaintiffs in this case does not severely burden, let\\\\nalone have the effect of \\u201cthoroughly excluding\\u201d (cf. Lee, 463 F.3d at 769) candidates from the\\\\nmajority population township entering a school board race.   Far from it:  three of the seven school\\\\nboard members may be elected from a candidate pool supplied by residents of Township 32N, R1W. \\\\n17.   Moreover, and as highlighted below, School Code \\u00a7 9-12 read as a whole is carefully\\\\ncalibrated to serve Illinois\\u2019 important \\u2013 if not compelling \\u2013  interest in bringing about, under\\\\npolitically palatable conditions, the consolidation of the State\\u2019s smaller school systems into unit\\\\nschool districts to more efficiently and cost-effectively secure public education of good quality for\\\\nstudents in grades K through 12.  \\\\n\\u2013 7 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 8 of 13 \\\\n   18.   District 535\\\\'s Board of Education is currently elected using the \\u201cFormat 4\\\" Official\\\\nBallot prescribed by School Code \\u00a7 9-12, which applies (insofar as pertinent for present purposes)\\\\nto community unit school districts formed prior to January 1, 1975 when the territory of the school\\\\ndistrict is greater than two congressional townships, or 72 square miles, except for those community\\\\nunit school districts formed prior to January 1, 1975 that only elect board members at large and\\\\nwithout restriction by area of residence within the district.   As District 535 does not fall within the\\\\nlatter excepted category,  its school board elections use the Format 4 ballot,  which provides that \\u201cnot\\\\nmore than 3 board members may be selected from any one congressional township\\u201d, and which\\\\napplies \\u201conly when less than 75% of the population.  is in one congressional township\\u201d.   105 ILCS\\\\n5/9-12 \\u201cFORMAT 4\\u201d.1\\\\n19.    If and when at least 75% but less than 90% of the population of such a district resides\\\\nin one congressional township, then the number of school board members to be selected from that\\\\none township increases to four, and the remaining three board members are selected from the district\\\\n1  Plaintiffs plead the facts which illustrate the applicability of Format 4 only obliquely, in Complaint paragraph\\\\n10 which asserts, \\u201cUnder the provisions of 105 ILCS 5/11A-8, succeeded by 105 ILCS 5/9, only three of the\\\\nseven members of the Board of Education of Putnam Community Unit School District # 535 may reside in\\\\nTownship 32 N R1W of the 3rd Principal Meridian, notwithstanding the fact that a majority of the residents of\\\\nsaid District reside in said township.\\u201d  (Emphasis added).  \\\\nReferenced \\u00a7 11A-8 of the School Code (105 ILCS 5/11A-8) described the requirements for passage of\\\\nreferenda  to  create  a  community  unit  school  district  and,  in  the  cases  of  community  unit  districts\\\\nencompassing more than two congressional townships or 72 square miles, prescribed the geographic\\\\nrepresentation requirements calibrated to population which are contained in the Official Ballot Formats set out\\\\nin School Code \\u00a7 9-12, reviewed above.   See former \\u00a7 11A-8(b), 105 ILCS 5/11A-8(b). \\\\nSection 11A-8 was repealed along with the rest of School Code Article 11A (\\u201cUnit District Formation\\u201d by Public\\\\nAct 94-1019, effective July 10, 2006.   In P.A. 94-1019, the legislature comprehensively updated school\\\\nreorganization mechanisms to further encourage and remove perceived barriers to school consolidations. \\\\nAs P.A. 94-1019 did not repeal School Code \\u00a7 9-12, the ballot  formats prescribed in that section remain in\\\\nuse, as applicable in particular unit districts.  \\\\n\\u2013 8 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 9 of 13 \\\\nin elections which are then conducted using Official Ballot Format 5.   See 105 ILCS 5/9-12\\\\n\\u201cFORMAT 5\\\".  \\\\n20.   If and when more than 90% of the population of such a district resides in one\\\\ncongressional township, Official Ballot Format 2 is used.   Then school board members are elected\\\\nat large, and  \\u201c[m]embership on the school board is not restricted by area of residence.\\u201d  See 105\\\\nILCS 5/9-12 \\u201cFORMAT 2\\\"; cf. Complaint Count Two, paragraph 14.B., in which Plaintiffs ask the\\\\nthis Court to direct that Format 2 be used in \\u201cany election for members of the board of education\\\\nof...District # 535\\\", and that \\u201ccandidates receiving the highest number of votes be elected to said\\\\nboard, irrespective of their place of residence in said district.\\u201d \\\\n21.   Plaintiffs are not entitled to such extraordinary equitable relief, nor to any relief at all.\\\\n The automatic adjustments of school board electoral mechanisms built into School Code \\u00a7 9-12\\\\nrepresent exactly the type of narrow tailoring  courts look for, in evaluating whether a ballot access\\\\nrestriction exceeds what is needed to serve a compelling state interest in situations where election\\\\nlaw restrictions impose a \\u201csevere\\u201d burden on rights of potential candidates.  \\\\n22.   But again, School Code \\u00a7 9-12\\\\'s election provisions do not place a \\u201csevere\\u201d burden on\\\\nprospective school board candidates from majority population townships, and find explicit sanction\\\\nin the U.S. Supreme Court\\u2019s decisions in Dusch and Hadley.    Any judicial evaluation of the election\\\\nprovisions  in  \\u00a7  9-12  must  proceed  under  the  standard  which  applies  to  \\u201creasonable\\\\nnondiscriminatory restrictions\\u201d which impose modest \\u201cburdens\\u201d to serve important State regulatory\\\\ninterests, see Lee v. Keith, above.   The provisions of the School Code challenged by Plaintiffs readily\\\\nsatisfy that standard. \\\\n\\u2013 9 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 10 of 13 \\\\n23.   Last but not least,  the de minimus and constitutionally permissible \\u201cburdens\\u201d assertedly\\\\nimposed by School Code \\u00a7 9-12\\\\'s applicable provisions are further alleviated by the fact that School\\\\nCode \\u00a7 9-22 provides a method by which Plaintiffs and their fellow electors / would-be candidates\\\\nresident in Township 32N, R1W can initiate a referendum on the proposition of electing school\\\\nboard members by school board districts if they deem that system preferable, instead of district-wide\\\\nas is presently done.  \\\\n24.   Section 9-22 authorizes such a referendum if initiated by the board of education, or on\\\\npetition of the lesser of 2,500 or 5% of registered voters of the district.   The proposition passes if a\\\\nsimple majority of voters, district-wide, approves it.   Thus, if District 535 voters in Township 32N\\\\nR1W want to eliminate the alleged unequal burdening of their rights as candidates by adopting an\\\\nelection-by-district system, then as the most populous group of electors in the district they have\\\\nample political power to attain this fully adequate remedy at law.\\\\n25.   Dismissal of Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims insofar as they are founded on the \\u201cfree and fair elections\\u201d\\\\nprovisions of the Article III, Section 3 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution is also warranted.   The\\\\nIllinois Supreme Court has equated the Illinois Constitution\\u2019s guarantee of \\u201cequal protection of the\\\\nlaws\\u201d, and the \\u201cfree and equal\\u201d requirements of Article III, Section 3, with protections afforded by\\\\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stating that no precedent suggests that\\\\nthe Illinois Constitution calls for more than the Federal Constitution in relation to equal protection\\\\nsafeguards.   Fumarolo v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 142 Ill.2d 54, 566 N.E.2d 1283, 1290 (1990).   \\\\n21.    In accordance with Local Rule 7.1(A)(2), Defendant respectfully requests an opportunity\\\\nto present oral argument on this Rule 12(b)(6) motion, to provide the Court an opportunity to\\\\n\\u2013 10 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 11 of 13 \\\\nquestion and receive clarification from the parties directly concerning any points deemed relevant\\\\nto disposition of the motion. \\\\nB. In support of its motion to stay briefing and other proceedings in this cause for\\\\na  reasonable  period  of  time  to  afford  the  Illinois  Attorney  General  an\\\\nopportunity  to  seek  intervention  for  the  purpose  of  defending  the\\\\nconstitutionality of the statutes involved, Defendant states that: \\\\n1.   Although eight weeks have passed since they commenced this action in state court,\\\\nPlaintiffs have not, to Defendant\\u2019s knowledge, served notice on the Illinois Attorney General of their\\\\ncause of action asserting that School Code Article 9\\\\'s pertinent provisions are unconstitutional, as\\\\nthey are required to do by Illinois Supreme Court Rule 19 in order to afford the State an opportunity\\\\nto seek intervention for the purpose of defending the constitutionality of the challenged law.\\\\n2.   Because Plaintiffs\\u2019 action contests the validity of Defendant\\u2019s Board of Education as\\\\nelected pursuant to the challenged statutes, and the right of current Board members to hold their\\\\noffices, it critically affects not only Putnam County Community Unit School District No. 235 but\\\\nother Illinois school districts in which elections are subject to the mandatory board representation\\\\nprovisions of School Code \\u00a7 9-12.    \\\\n3.   In light of the requirements of Illinois Supreme Court Rule 19 and the clearly apparent\\\\ninterest and obligation of the State to defend the constitutionality of School Code Section 9-12\\\\nchallenged in this action, Defendant has provided letter notice of this action to the Illinois Attorney\\\\nGeneral.   A copy of said notice as hand-delivered to Attorney General\\u2019s Chicago office on February\\\\n13, 2007 is attached to this motion.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (\\u201cBOP\\u201d) has established two separate systems to \\\\ncalculate its residents\\u2019 \\u201ccriminal history scores,\\u201d a number that is used to determine Plaintiffs\\u2019 \\\\nsecurity classification, i.e. the security level of the prisons in which Plaintiffs are placed, and their \\\\neligibility for home confinement and release to a halfway house.  \\\\n2.   These  two,  separate  criminal  history  scoring  systems  apply  arbitrarily  and \\\\nunequally to BOP residents based on the court from which they were sentenced \\u2014 federal district \\\\ncourts or another court system, such as the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, other state \\\\ncourts, or military tribunals.   This action specifically challenges the application of a different \\\\ncriminal history scoring rule to the group of individuals that are sentenced by the Superior Court \\\\nfor the District of Columbia and transferred to BOP custody to serve their sentences, i.e. Plaintiffs \\\\nand proposed class.  \\\\n3.   The first system \\u2014 which is based on Chapter 4 of the United States Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines\\u2019 calculation of criminal history points \\u2014 applies to the vast majority of BOP residents \\\\nwho were sentenced by a federal district court and who enter the BOP with a commitment order, \\\\na statement of reasons, and/or a presentence report that lists their Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\\\nhistory points.   For these residents, the BOP simply relies upon their Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 \\\\ncriminal history points to determine their criminal history score.  \\\\n4.   The second system applies to the small minority of BOP residents who do not enter \\\\nthe BOP with a Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal history points calculation, including individuals \\\\nwho were sentenced by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, other state courts, or \\\\nmilitary tribunals.   See U.S. DEP\\u2019T OF JUSTICE, FED. BUREAU OF PRISONS, PROGRAM STATEMENT \\\\n  2 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 3 of 33\\\\n5100.08: INMATE SECURITY DESIGNATION & CUSTODY CLASSIFICATION (\\u201cPS 5100.08\\u201d) 33 (2006).   \\\\nFor  those  residents,  including  Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members,  the  BOP\\u2019s  Program \\\\nStatement 5100.08 applies a separate scoring system to tabulate their criminal history points and \\\\nthen converts those points into a criminal history score.  \\\\n5.   In the overwhelming number of cases, people subject to the second system receive \\\\nhigher criminal history scores than people subject to the first system.   In other words, the BOP\\u2019s \\\\nProgram Statement 5100.08 yields more criminal history points \\u2014 and a higher criminal history \\\\nscore \\u2014 than the criminal history points calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines for similarly \\\\nsituated incarcerated people.  \\\\n6.   Because the criminal history score is the most significant factor in determining \\\\nsomeone\\u2019s security classification, individuals with higher criminal history scores are more likely \\\\nto be incarcerated in a high security facility.   As a result of BOP\\u2019s arbitrary and unequal criminal \\\\nhistory scoring system, Plaintiffs and proposed class members are more likely to be incarcerated \\\\nin high security BOP facilities, where they are subjected to greater violence and offered fewer \\\\nprogramming opportunities, and they are denied opportunities to seek release to home confinement \\\\nthat might otherwise be available to them.  \\\\n7.   Empirical evidence bears this unequal treatment out.   Twelve percent of BOP \\\\nresidents overall are incarcerated in high security institutions, whereas 39 percent of \\u201cD.C.  Code \\\\noffenders\\u201d are housed in those institutions.   See COUNCIL FOR COURT EXCELLENCE, ANALYSIS OF \\\\nBOP DATA SNAPSHOT FROM JULY 4, 2020 FOR THE DISTRICT TASK FORCE ON JAILS AND JUSTICE 4 \\\\n(2020),  http://www.courtexcellence.org/uploads/publications/Analysis_of_BOP_Data_Snapshot \\\\n_from_7420.pdf.   Plaintiffs and proposed class members  are three times more likely to be \\\\n  3 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 4 of 33\\\\nincarcerated in a high security penitentiary than other BOP residents and could be systematically \\\\nexcluded from seeking release to home confinement.  \\\\n8.   The  BOP\\u2019s  separate  scoring  system  also  disproportionately  affects  its  Black \\\\nresidents as 95.6 percent of people who are sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court and who are in \\\\nBOP custody are Black.  See COUNCIL FOR COURT EXCELLENCE, ANALYSIS OF BOP DATA \\\\nSNAPSHOT FROM JULY 4, 2020 FOR THE DISTRICT TASK FORCE ON JAILS AND JUSTICE 2 (2020), \\\\nhttp://www.courtexcellence.org/uploads/publications/Analysis_of_BOP_Data_Snapshot_from_7\\\\n420.pdf.   By contrast, the majority of individuals sentenced by federal district courts are white.   \\\\nThe BOP tracks the racial composition of individuals in its custody and at individual facilities and \\\\nis aware of the racial differences between the two populations.   Applying a harsher criminal history \\\\nscoring system to the majority-Black population of individuals sentenced by the Superior Court \\\\nfor the District of Columbia puts them at a significant disadvantage to their majority-white federal \\\\ncounterparts.   This is doubly concerning because the BOP\\u2019s own regulations make clear that \\u201cstaff \\\\nshall not discriminate against inmates on the basis of race * * * [in] providing access to work, \\\\nhousing and programs.\\u201d  28 C.F.R. \\u00a7 551.90.  \\\\n9.   The BOP\\u2019s two-tiered system for calculating criminal history scores is arbitrary, \\\\ncapricious, and contrary to law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 501 \\\\net seq., and unconstitutional in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment, \\\\nU.S. Cons. amend.  V.  \\\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \\\\n10.   This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\\\nSection 1331 because it arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States.  \\\\n  4 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 5 of 33\\\\n11.   Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \\\\n\\u00a7 2201 and 2202, by 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 702, by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and 65, and by the \\\\ninherent equitable powers of this Court. \\\\n12.   Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1391(e)(1) because a substantial \\\\npart of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred, and continue to occur, in this \\\\nDistrict.  \\\\nPARTIES \\\\n13.   Plaintiff Jonathan Blades was convicted of D.C. Code offenses and is serving his \\\\nsentence in the Bureau of Prisons.   Mr. Blades is Black and currently incarcerated at United States \\\\nPenitentiary (USP) Pollock, a high security penitentiary located in Pollock, Louisiana.    \\\\n14.   Mr.  Blades\\u2019  criminal  history  points  were  assessed  under  Program  Statement \\\\n5100.08, and not the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, because Mr. Blades was sentenced in the \\\\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia and is serving his sentence in BOP custody.   \\\\n15.   If Mr. Blades\\u2019 criminal history points were scored under the Sentencing Guidelines, \\\\nhis criminal history points would be lower than they currently are because the Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines would not award points for his juvenile probationary sentences or for his 2002 adult \\\\nprobationary sentences that occurred more than 10 years prior to the instant offense.  \\\\n16.   Plaintiff Antwan Buchanan was convicted of D.C. Code offenses and is serving his \\\\nsentence in the Bureau of Prisons.   Mr. Buchanan is Black and is currently incarcerated at USP \\\\nBig Sandy, a high security penitentiary located in Inez, Kentucky.  \\\\n17.   Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s criminal history points were assessed under Program Statement \\\\n5100.08, and not the Sentencing Guidelines, because Mr. Buchanan was sentenced in the Superior \\\\nCourt of the District of Columbia and is serving his sentence in BOP custody.   \\\\n  5 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 6 of 33\\\\n18.   If  Mr.  Buchanan\\u2019s  criminal  history  points  were  scored  under  the  Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines, his criminal history points would be lower than they currently are because the \\\\nSentencing Guidelines would not count a 2002 conviction and a 2004 conviction and he would \\\\nreceive fewer criminal history points for his 2006 and 2008 convictions.  \\\\n19.   Defendant Michael Carvajal is sued in his official capacity as Director, Federal Bureau \\\\nof Prisons.   In this capacity, Defendant Carvajal oversees the operations of the Federal Bureau of \\\\nPrisons.  \\\\nBACKGROUND \\\\n20.   Congress requires the Bureau of Prisons to consider \\u201cthe history and characteristics \\\\nof the prisoner\\u201d as well as a \\u201cprisoner\\u2019s security designation\\u201d when designating prisoners to \\\\ncorrectional facilities.   18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 3621(b).  \\\\n21.   Pursuant to that statutory requirement, the BOP issued Program Statement 5100.08 \\\\nin 2006, outlining how the BOP would weigh those factors when designating individuals to prisons \\\\nacross the country.    \\\\n22.   BOP institutions fall into \\u201cfive security levels\\u201d: \\u201cMINIMUM, LOW, MEDIUM, \\\\nHIGH, and ADMINISTRATIVE.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 7.  \\\\n23.   To designate prisoners into one of those five security levels of institutions, the BOP \\\\nrelies on a set of inputs to \\u201ccalculate[] a [security] point score for [an] inmate which * * * is then \\\\nmatched with a commensurate security level institution.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 8.   \\\\n24.   Subject to certain caveats, an individual with a security point score between 0 and \\\\n11 security points is matched to a minimum security facility, between 12 and 15 security points to \\\\na low security facility, between 16 and 23 security points to a medium security facility, and 24 and \\\\nover security points to a high security facility.   See PS 5100.08 at 8.  \\\\n  6 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 7 of 33\\\\n25.   The BOP relies on a set of established factors to determine the security point score, \\\\nincluding \\u201cvoluntary surrender,\\u201d the \\u201cseverity of current offense,\\u201d \\u201chistory of violence,\\u201d \\u201chistory \\\\nof escape or attempts,\\u201d \\u201ctype of detainer,\\u201d \\u201cage,\\u201d \\u201ceducation level,\\u201d \\u201cdrug and alcohol abuse,\\u201d and \\\\n\\u201ccriminal history score.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 30\\u201338.   To calculate the total security point score, the \\\\nBOP adds up the points assigned to each of these criteria.   Id. at 41.   \\\\n26.   The BOP explains in Program Statement 5100.08 that the \\u201ccriminal history score\\u201d \\\\nis \\u201cone of the factors used to calculate the inmate\\u2019s security point total.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 10.   \\\\n27.   The criminal history score is one of the most influential categories in determining \\\\nthe total security point total.   For example, while the \\u201cseverity of current offense\\u201d category can \\\\nincrease the security point by a maximum of seven points for the \\u201cgreatest\\u201d severity offense, the \\\\ncriminal history score can increase the security point score by ten points \\u2014 a difference large \\\\nenough on its own to move a prisoner from a low security facility to a high security facility.   See \\\\nPS 5100.08 at 8, 32\\u201333.  \\\\n28.   Program Statement 5100.08 establishes two systems for deriving criminal history \\\\nscores.  \\\\n29.   The vast majority of prisoners in BOP custody are convicted of federal offenses \\\\nand sentenced by federal district courts.   For those individuals \\u2014 referred to here as \\u201cindividuals \\\\nwith federal sentences\\u201d \\u2014 their \\u201c[criminal history score] is derived from the US Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines Criminal History Points, as reflected in the final judgment and the [statement of \\\\nreasons].   If not found in either the Judgment or [statement of reasons],\\u201d the BOP \\u201cuse[s] the points \\\\nassessed by the [United States Probation Office] in the [Presentence Report].\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n  7 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 8 of 33\\\\n30.   The BOP converts the Sentencing Guidelines criminal history points into a criminal \\\\nhistory score using the conversion table depicted below.   That criminal history score is then used \\\\nto determine the security point score.    \\\\nCriminal History Points  Criminal History Score \\\\n0 to 1 point  0 \\\\n2 to 3 points  2 \\\\n4 to 6 points  4 \\\\n7 to 9 points  6 \\\\n10 to 12 points  8 \\\\n13 or more points  10 \\\\n \\\\nPS 5100.08 at 33.   For instance, based on the table above, a person with five criminal history points \\\\nreceives a criminal history score of four.   See PS 5100.08 at 33.   \\\\n31.   For individuals in BOP custody who are sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court1 \\u2014 \\\\nreferred to here as \\u201cindividuals with D.C. sentences\\u201d \\u2014 the BOP applies a different rule set forth \\\\nin Program Statement 5100.08 to calculate their criminal history points, which is then converted \\\\nto a criminal history score pursuant to the conversion table in Paragraph 30.   See PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n32.   Unlike individuals with federal sentences, individuals with D.C. sentences do not \\\\nenter the BOP with \\u201cUS Sentencing Guidelines Criminal History Points\\u201d that are \\u201creflected in the \\\\nfinal judgment,\\u201d a judicial statement of reasons, or a Presentence Report.   PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n                                                 \\\\n1 Pursuant to the Revitalization Act, nearly all individuals sentenced to felonies by the D.C. \\\\nSuperior Court are immediately transferred to BOP custody to serve out their sentences.   For that \\\\nreason, individuals with D.C. Code convictions comprise the bulk of individuals affected by the \\\\nBOP\\u2019s rudimentary and arbitrary scoring scheme.   Because this lawsuit focuses on the unfair \\\\ntreatment of individuals with D.C. Code convictions, only that group will be referenced throughout \\\\nthe motion.   It is worth noting, however, that the criminal history scoring of individuals serving \\\\nother state or military tribunal sentences is equally unfair and arbitrary for the same reasons.  \\\\n  8 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 9 of 33\\\\n33.   Program  Statement  5100.08\\u2019s  rule  for  calculating  criminal  history  points  for \\\\nindividuals with D.C. sentences is materially different than the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\\\nhistory points calculation that the BOP relies on for individuals with federal sentences.    \\\\n34.   Under Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s rule for individuals with D.C. sentences, the \\\\nBOP does not rely on any previous calculation of criminal history points and undertakes the \\\\ncalculation itself after obtaining an \\u201cNCIC III Report,\\u201d a criminal history report derived from the \\\\nNational Crime Information Center database maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   \\\\nPS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n35.   After obtaining the NCIC III Report, Program Statement 5100.08 instructs the BOP \\\\nto calculate the criminal history points for individuals with D.C. sentences as follows: \\\\na. Add 3 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one \\\\nyear and one month; \\\\nb. Add 2 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least \\\\nsixty days not counted in (a); \\\\nc. Add 1 point for each prior conviction not counted in (a) or (b), up to \\\\na total of 4 points for this item; and, \\\\nd. Add 2 points if the instant offense is a revocation accompanied by a \\\\nnew state or federal conviction, or if the instant offense occurred \\\\nwhile under federal supervision including incarceration, probation, \\\\nparole or supervised release.  \\\\n \\\\nPS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n \\\\n36.   The BOP\\u2019s calculation of criminal history points under Program Statement 5100.08 \\\\nis then converted to a criminal history score based on the table depicted in Paragraph 30.   \\\\n37.   The system the BOP uses to calculate criminal history points for individuals with \\\\nD.C. sentences results in systematically higher criminal history scores than their similarly situated \\\\nfederal counterparts.   This leads to higher, more restrictive security designations for individuals \\\\nwith D.C. sentences as compared to individuals with federal sentences that have identical criminal \\\\nhistories.  \\\\n  9 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 10 of 33\\\\n38.   The Sentencing Guidelines generally does not award criminal history points for the \\\\nfollowing categories of offenses and sentences whereas the BOP\\u2019s scoring rule contains no such \\\\nexceptions or limitations:  \\\\na.  Stale offenses and sentences \\\\nb.  Petty offenses \\\\nc.  Juvenile offenses \\\\nd.  Suspended sentences \\\\ne.  Multiple sentences for offenses in the same charging instrument or that were \\\\nsentenced on the same day \\\\n \\\\nStale offenses and sentences \\\\n \\\\n39.   The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards three points for a \\u201cprior sentence of \\\\nimprisonment exceeding one year and one month\\u201d that was \\u201cimposed within fifteen years of the \\\\ndefendant\\u2019s  commencement  of  the  instant  offense.\\u201d  United  States  Sentencing  Commission, \\\\nGuidelines Manual, \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(a), 4A1.2(e)(1) (emphasis added).   This includes any sentence \\\\n\\u201cexceeding one year and one month, whenever imposed, that resulted in the [individual] being \\\\nincarcerated during any part of such fifteen-year period.\\u201d  Id. \\\\n40.   In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards three points for \\\\n\\u201ceach prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month\\u201d regardless of when that \\\\nsentence was imposed, PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n41.   The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards two points for \\u201ceach prior sentence of \\\\nimprisonment of at least sixty days not counted in [\\u00a74A1.1(a)],\\u201d USSG \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(b), only if that \\\\nsentence \\u201cwas imposed within ten years of the defendant\\u2019s commencement of the instant offense,\\u201d \\\\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2) (emphasis added).  \\\\n42.   In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards two points \\u201cfor \\\\neach prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days [but not greater than one year and one \\\\nmonth],\\u201d regardless of when that sentence was imposed.

The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards one point for \\u201cfor each prior sentence not \\\\ncounted in [\\u00a7 4A1.1](a) or [\\u00a7 4A1.1](b), up to a total of 4 points,\\u201d USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(c), only if that \\\\nsentence \\u201cwas imposed within ten years of the defendant\\\\'s commencement of the instant offense,\\u201d  \\\\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2).  \\\\n44.   In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards one point \\u201cfor \\\\neach prior conviction not [previously] counted * * * up to a total of 4 points for this item,\\u201d \\\\nregardless of when that sentence was imposed.   PS 5100.08 at 33.   \\\\n45.   Consider an individual with a D.C. sentence who committed their \\u201cinstant offense\\u201d \\\\non January 1, 2015 and had the following criminal history: \\\\na.  Two-year prison sentence imposed on January 1, 1980 \\\\nb.  Six-month prison sentence imposed on January 1, 1984 \\\\nc.  Three-month probationary sentence imposed on January 1, 1986 \\\\n \\\\nUnder the BOP\\u2019s rule, that person would receive a total of six criminal history points (three points \\\\nfor the 1980 sentence, two points for the 1984 sentence, and one point for the 1986 sentence) for \\\\na criminal history score of four.   See PS 5100.08 at 33; supra \\u00b6 35.   \\\\n46.   A  similarly  situated  individual  with  a  federal  sentence  who  had  an  identical \\\\ncriminal history and an identical instant offense would receive zero criminal history points \\u2014 a \\\\ncriminal history score of zero \\u2014 because each of the three sentences imposed would be considered \\\\nstale and not count under the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal history points calculation.  \\\\n47.   Because Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s rule does not contain a staleness exception \\\\nfor individuals with D.C. sentences, unlike the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 points calculation for \\\\nindividuals with federal sentences, the BOP\\u2019s rule systematically results in higher criminal history \\\\npoints and higher criminal history scores for Plaintiff and proposed class members, as compared \\\\nto similarly situated individuals with federal sentences.    \\\\n  11 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 12 of 33\\\\nPetty offenses \\\\n48.

Under the Sentencing Guidelines, certain \\u201cprior offenses and offenses similar to \\\\nthem,\\u201d including \\u201c[p]ublic intoxication,\\u201d \\u201c[l]oitering,\\u201d and \\u201c[v]agrancy,\\u201d are \\u201cnever counted\\u201d in a \\\\ncriminal history score.   USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2).  \\\\n50.   Under the Sentencing Guidelines, other \\u201cprior offenses and offenses similar to \\\\nthem,\\u201d  including  \\u201creckless  driving,\\u201d  \\u201c[t]respassing,\\u201d  \\u201c[c]ontempt  of  court,\\u201d  or  \\u201c[d]isorderly \\\\nconduct,\\u201d are \\u201ccounted only if (A) the sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or \\\\na term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an instant \\\\noffense.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).  \\\\n51.   In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards criminal history \\\\npoints regardless of type of prior offense.   See PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n52.   For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a prior public intoxication \\\\noffense would receive criminal history points where as an individual with a federal sentence with \\\\na similar prior conviction would not.  \\\\n53.   Likewise, an individual with a D.C. sentence with an instant drug sale offense and \\\\na prior conviction for driving without a license offense for which they received a sentence of 10 \\\\ndays of imprisonment would receive criminal history points, and potentially a higher criminal \\\\nhistory score, that a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence would not.  \\\\n54.   As a result of this material difference in treatment of prior offenses, individuals \\\\nwith D.C. sentences systematically receive higher criminal history points, and therefore higher \\\\n  12 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 13 of 33\\\\ncriminal  history  scores,  as  compared  to  similarly  situated  federal  counterparts.  \\\\nJuvenile offenses \\\\n55.   The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines limit the awarding of criminal history points for \\\\nprior offenses committed as a juvenile.   See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c).   \\\\n56.   The  Sentencing  Guidelines  award  two  criminal  history  points  for  each  prior \\\\njuvenile offense that resulted in \\u201cconfinement of at least sixty days\\u201d only when \\u201cthe defendant was \\\\nreleased from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense.\\u201d \\\\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(A).  \\\\n57.   The Sentencing Guidelines award one criminal history point for each prior juvenile \\\\noffense that did not result in confinement of at least sixty days only if the \\u201csentence [was] imposed \\\\nwithin  five  years  of  the  defendant\\u2019s  commencement  of  the  instant  offense.\\u201d  USSG \\\\n\\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(B).  \\\\n58.   While the Sentencing Guidelines award criminal history points only for juvenile \\\\noffenses imposed within a limited period of time, the BOP awards criminal history points for all \\\\njuvenile offenses without any limitations, see PS 5100.08 at 33.    \\\\n59.   For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a 1995 juvenile sentence that \\\\nresulted in ninety days\\u2019 imprisonment will receive two criminal history points, and a higher \\\\ncriminal history score, than a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence.   \\\\n60.   As a result of this material difference in treatment of juvenile offenses, individuals \\\\nwith D.C. sentences systematically receive higher criminal history points, and potentially higher \\\\ncriminal history scores, as compared to similarly situated federal counterparts.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  13 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 14 of 33\\\\nSuspended sentences \\\\n61.   The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines award three, two, or one criminal history points \\\\nfor each prior conviction depending on the length of sentence for those convictions.   See USSG \\\\n\\u00a7 4A1.1(a)-(c).  \\\\n62.   To determine the length of sentence for prior convictions where \\u201cpart of a sentence \\\\nof imprisonment was suspended,\\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines consider only \\u201cthe portion that was \\\\nnot suspended.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(b)(2).   \\\\n63.   Like the Sentencing Guidelines, for individuals with D.C. sentences, Program \\\\nStatement 5100.08 also awards three, two, or one criminal history points for each prior conviction \\\\ndepending on the length of sentence for those prior convictions.   See PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n64.   Unlike the Sentencing Guidelines, the BOP considers the total length of sentence \\\\nof those prior convictions regardless of whether a portion of that sentence was suspended.   See PS \\\\n5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n65.   For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a prior sentence of two years\\u2019 \\\\nimprisonment, suspended as to all but two months, would receive three criminal history points \\\\nunder Program Statement 5100.08.   By contrast, an individual with a federal sentence with the \\\\nsame prior sentence would receive only one criminal history point, and only if that prior conviction \\\\nwas an applicable offense and did not fall within the staleness exception.   \\\\n66.   As a result of this material difference in the treatment of suspended sentences, \\\\nindividuals  with  D.C.  sentences  systematically  receive  higher  criminal  history  points,  and \\\\ntherefore higher criminal history scores, as compared to similarly situated federal counterparts.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  14 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 15 of 33\\\\nMultiple sentences for offenses in the same charging instrument or that were sentenced on \\\\nthe same day \\\\n \\\\n67.   The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines treat certain prior sentences as a single sentence.   \\\\n68.   Under the Sentencing Guidelines, prior sentences that were not separated by an \\\\nintervening arrest are counted as one sentence for purposes of calculating criminal history points \\\\nif they \\u201cresulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument\\u201d or if \\u201cthe sentences \\\\nwere imposed on the same day.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).  \\\\n69.   By contrast, Program Statement 5100.08 treats all prior sentences as separate \\\\nsentences for purposes of calculating criminal history points.  \\\\n70.   For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence who previously received two \\\\nconcurrent sentences of 24 months\\u2019 imprisonment for two counts of possession of cocaine charged \\\\nin the same indictment would receive six criminal history points under Program Statement 5100.08 \\\\nbecause each sentence of 24 months would count as three points.   See PS 5100.08 at 33.   By \\\\ncontrast, a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence would only receive three criminal \\\\nhistory points under the same scenario because the Sentencing Guidelines would treat the two \\\\nconcurrent 24-month sentences as a sentence that \\u201cresulted from offenses contained in the same \\\\ncharging instrument.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).  \\\\n71.   As a result of this material difference in treatment of sentences contained in the \\\\nsame  charging  instrument  or  charged  on  the  same  day,  individuals  with  D.C.  sentences \\\\nsystematically receive higher criminal history points, and therefore higher criminal history scores, \\\\nas compared to their similarly situated federal counterparts.  \\\\n72.   In addition to greatly determining security designations, the BOP\\u2019s criminal history \\\\nscore also plays a significant role in determining a prisoner\\u2019s PATTERN risk assessment score.  \\\\n  15 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 16 of 33\\\\n73.

Had Mr. Blades been scored according to the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\\\nhistory points calculation, he would only have received three criminal history points, resulting \\\\nin a criminal history score of two: \\\\na.  Mr. Blades would receive one point for his 2006 adult convictions for possessing a \\\\ncontrolled substance offense and driving while intoxicated offense (conviction (f) \\\\nin paragraph 83) because there was no intervening arrest and he was sentenced on \\\\nthe same day for both offenses, see USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).  \\\\nb.

In part because of Mr. Blades\\u2019 arbitrarily higher criminal history score, he is being \\\\nincarcerated in a high security facility (USP) in the BOP.  \\\\n93.   As a result of his incarceration in a high security facility, Mr. Blades is stigmatized \\\\nand treated worse than identically situated incarcerated people solely because of the court in which \\\\nhe was convicted.  \\\\n94.   Mr. Blades has less access to educational and vocational programming at a high \\\\nsecurity facility compared to people incarcerated at lower security facilities.  \\\\n95.

Mr. Buchanan would have received four points for his 2008 conviction for one \\\\ncount of aggravated assault and one count of carrying a dangerous weapon \\u2014 three \\\\npoints for the carrying a dangerous weapon count, because that count resulted in a \\\\nsentence of incarceration over one year and one month, see USSG \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(a), \\\\n4A1.2(e)(2), and one point for the aggravated assault under the catch-all provision \\\\nthat \\u201c[a]dd[s] one point for each prior sentence resulting from a conviction of a \\\\ncrime of violence that did not [already] receive any points * * * because such \\\\nsentence was treated as a single sentence,\\u201d USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(e).  \\\\nd.  Mr. Buchanan would have received one point for his 2014 conviction for possession \\\\nwith intent to distribute marijuana.   See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(c).  \\\\n  23 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 24 of 33\\\\ne.  Mr. Buchanan would have received two points for committing the instant offense \\\\nwhile under supervision.   See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(e).  \\\\n117.   Mr. Buchanan would not receive any points under the Sentencing Guidelines for \\\\nhis 2002 conviction for possession of marijuana because it is outside the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 \\\\n10-year look-back period.   See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2).  \\\\n118.   Mr. Buchanan would not receive any points under the Sentencing Guidelines for \\\\nhis 2004 convictions for one count of operating a vehicle with a suspended license and one count \\\\nof  operating  an  unregistered  vehicle  because  those  convictions  are  outside  the  Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines\\u2019 ten-year look-back period, see USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2).  \\\\n119.   Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s criminal history score is unjustifiably higher than what it would be \\\\nif he were scored under the Sentencing Guidelines and has contributed to his incarceration in a \\\\nhigh security USP.    \\\\n120.   As  a  result  of  his  incarceration  in  a  high  security  facility,  Mr.  Buchanan  is \\\\nstigmatized and treated worse than identically situated incarcerated people solely because of the \\\\ncourt in which he was convicted.  \\\\n121.   Mr.  Buchanan  has  significantly  less  access  to  educational  and  vocational \\\\nprogramming at a high security facility compared to people incarcerated at lower security facility.   \\\\n122.   Mr. Buchanan has sought to enroll in a forklift operation course at his high security \\\\nfacility, but one is not available at that facility while it is available at medium and low security \\\\nfacilities.   \\\\n123.   Mr. Buchanan is unable to earn as much money at his prison job in his high security \\\\nfacility than he would be if he were held at a medium or low security facility.  \\\\n  24 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 25 of 33\\\\n124.   Mr. Buchanan has fewer opportunities to speak to his family and loved ones at his \\\\nhigh security facility than residents at medium or low security facilities have to speak to their \\\\nfamilies and loved ones.  \\\\n125.   Mr. Buchanan has fewer opportunities to leave his cell and to breathe fresh air \\\\noutside than residents at medium or low security facilities.   \\\\n126.   Mr. Buchanan is unable to practice his religion to the same extent as residents at a \\\\nmedium or low security facility are able to practice the same religion, in part because high security \\\\nfacilities  have  fewer  chaplains  and  fewer  religious  resources  than  medium  or  low  security \\\\nfacilities.   \\\\n127.   Mr. Buchanan is seeking transfer to a medium or low security facility and release \\\\nto home confinement.   \\\\n128.   Mr.  Buchanan\\u2019s  PATTERN  score is  also  higher  than  similarly  situated  BOP \\\\nresidents, meaning that Mr. Buchanan will earn fewer good time credits and serve a longer prison \\\\nsentence  than  residents  whose  criminal  history  scores  are  calculated  under  the  Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines.  \\\\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \\\\n129.   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), Jonathan Blades \\\\nand Antwan Buchanan bring this action as a class consisting of all people who are or will be \\\\nconvicted of District of Columbia code offenses who were sentenced from the Superior Court of \\\\nthe District of Columbia and who are held in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.  \\\\n130.   Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend the class definition or to establish sub-classes \\\\nas appropriate if discovery or further investigation reveals that the class should be expanded  \\\\n  25 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 26 of 33\\\\n131.   Numerosity: The class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable.   While the \\\\nprecise size of the class is unknown and is constantly changing, Plaintiffs believe that roughly \\\\n3,500 people currently fit the class definition, although the composition of the class changes daily.    \\\\n132.   Joinder of these thousands of people is impractical because the number of unnamed, \\\\nfuture class members who will be subject to the challenged policy is unknown and unknowable.    \\\\n133.   Proposed class members are highly unlikely to file individual suits on their own \\\\nbehalf given the practical, legal, and monetary difficulties that prevent incarcerated people serving \\\\nsentences in the BOP from accessing independent counsel.  \\\\n134.   Commonality: The claims of the class share common issues of law, including but \\\\nnot limited to whether the challenged policy violates the APA and the Fifth Amendment.  \\\\n135.   Typicality: The claims of Jonathan Blades and Antwan Buchanan are typical of \\\\nthose of the class as a whole because their criminal history points were assessed under the \\\\nchallenged policy and they would receive lower criminal history points, a lower criminal history \\\\nscore, and lower security point score, if they were scored the same as similarly situated BOP \\\\nresidents who were sentenced by a federal district court. \\\\n136.   Adequacy: Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives who meet all requirements \\\\nof Rule 23(a)(4).   They have no conflict of interest with other class members and will fairly and \\\\nadequately protect the interests of the class.  \\\\n137.   Plaintiffs\\u2019 counsel will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class, and counsel \\\\nhave experience with the factual and legal issues litigated in this case, as well as with representing \\\\nplaintiffs in federal civil rights class actions.   \\\\n138.   Defendant has acted and will act on grounds generally applicable to the class, \\\\nthereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a whole.   This is \\\\n  26 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 27 of 33\\\\nbecause Defendant\\u2019s actions were taken pursuant to a policy and practice of the BOP.   A permanent \\\\ninjunction of the policy will therefore benefit all class members.  \\\\nCAUSES OF ACTION \\\\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\\\nARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTION IN VIOLATION OF THE \\\\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\\\n \\\\n139.   The APA requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful and set aside agency \\\\naction\\u201d that is \\u201carbitrary,\\u201d \\u201ccapricious,\\u201d or \\u201can abuse of discretion.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(A).    \\\\n140.   The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is an \\u201cagency\\u201d under the APA.   5 U.S.C. \\\\n\\u00a7 551(1).  \\\\n141.   The  BOP\\u2019s  criminal  history  scoring  scheme,  set  forth  in  Program  Statement \\\\n5100.08, is final agency action that is reviewable under the APA because it represents the end of \\\\nthe agency\\u2019s decisionmaking process and creates legal consequences, namely, the increased \\\\nlikelihood  of  more  restrictions  on  liberty,  unconstitutionally  disparate  treatment  and \\\\nstigmatization, and other harmful effects on Plaintiffs and proposed class members.  \\\\n142.   Program  Statement  5100.08\\u2019s  criminal  history  scoring  rule  for  individuals \\\\nsentenced by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse \\\\nof discretion because the BOP failed to consider significant disparities between its scheme and the \\\\nU.S. Sentencing Guideline\\u2019s scoring rules for individuals with federal sentences.   The BOP also \\\\nfailed to consider how these differences result in systematically higher criminal history scores and \\\\nsecurity  point  scores  for  individuals  with  D.C.  sentences,  which  contributes  to  their \\\\ndisproportionate placement in higher security facilities.  \\\\n143.   The BOP also failed to consider the discriminatory racial impacts of such a policy \\\\nas the overwhelming majority of individuals sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court are Black, and \\\\n  27 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 28 of 33\\\\nthe BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule contributes to these individuals having higher criminal \\\\nhistory scores, higher security classifications, and more restrictive housing placements.    \\\\n144.   Defendants\\u2019 decision, in the challenged policy, to treat Plaintiffs and proposed class \\\\nmembers more harshly than their federal counterparts is arbitrary and capricious.  \\\\n145.   Defendants\\u2019 policy causes Plaintiffs and proposed class members injuries because \\\\nit subjects them to unconstitutional and discriminatory treatment, unduly restricts their liberty, \\\\ndenies them programming opportunities, and subjects them to institutions with greater incidents \\\\nof violence.    \\\\n146.   The challenged policy violates the APA because it is arbitrary and capricious and \\\\nit therefore must be set aside.  \\\\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\\\nACTION CONTRARY TO LAW, IN VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE \\\\nPROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\\\n \\\\n147.   The Administrative Procedure Act requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful \\\\nand set aside agency action\\u201d that is \\u201cotherwise not in accordance with law.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(A).    \\\\n148.   The BOP\\u2019s Criminal History Score policy violates the APA because it is \\u201cnot in \\\\naccordance with law\\u201d\\u2014in this case, the BOP\\u2019s own regulation that it \\u201cshall not discriminate \\\\nagainst inmates on the basis of race * * * [in] the making of administrative decisions and providing \\\\naccess to work, housing and programs.\\u201d 28 C.F.R. \\u00a7 551.90.  \\\\n149.   The overwhelming number of individuals sentenced by D.C. Superior Court \\u2014 \\\\nover 95 percent \\u2014 are Black.  The BOP closely maintains statistics on the race of its residents and \\\\nis aware that policies affecting individuals with D.C. sentences would impact a majority Black \\\\npopulation.   Therefore, Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule \\u2014 which \\\\nresults in higher criminal history scores and more restrictive housing \\u2014 disproportionately affects \\\\n  28 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 29 of 33\\\\nBlack residents in BOP\\u2019s custody as compared to its majority-white federal population, in violation \\\\nof the BOP\\u2019s own anti-discrimination housing regulations.  \\\\n150.   Because Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule violates the \\\\nBOP\\u2019s own regulation, it violates the APA\\u2019s lawfulness requirement and must be set aside.  \\\\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\\\nACTION CONTRARY TO CONSTITUITONAL RIGHT, IN VIOLATION OF THE \\\\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\\\n \\\\n151.   The Administrative Procedure Act requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful \\\\nand  set  aside  agency  action\\u201d  that  is  \\u201ccontrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or \\\\nimmunity.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(B).    \\\\n152.   The BOP\\u2019s Criminal History Score policy violates the APA because it is \\u201ccontrary \\\\nto constitutional right\\u201d\\u2014in this case, the Fifth Amendment\\u2019s right to equal protection.    This claim \\\\nincorporates all of the points raised with regards to the Constitutional claim, see infra \\u00b6\\u00b6 154\\u2013160.    \\\\n153.   Because Program Statement 5100.08 violates the Fifth Amendment, it also runs \\\\nafoul of the APA\\u2019s requirement that rules not conflict with constitutional rights and privileges.  \\\\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\\\nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE \\\\nFIFTH AMENDMENT \\\\n \\\\n154.   The Fifth Amendment precludes the federal government from treating similarly \\\\nsituated parties differently for no rational reason.   See 3883 Connecticut LLC v. District of \\\\nColumbia, 336 F.3d 1068, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Fraternal Order of Police v. United States, 152 \\\\nF.3d 998, 1002 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (\\u201cEqual protection analysis is substantially identical under the \\\\nFifth Amendment and the Fourteenth.\\u201d), reh\\u2019g granted on other grounds, 173 F.3d 898 (D.C. Cir. \\\\n1999).  \\\\n  29 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 30 of 33\\\\n155.   Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members,  who  were  sentenced  to  a  term  of \\\\nimprisonment by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, are similarly situated to other \\\\nBOP residents who were sentenced to a term of imprisonment by any of the federal district courts.   \\\\nBy law, individuals \\u201csentenced pursuant to the D.C. Code * * * shall be subject to any law or \\\\nregulation applicable to persons committed for violations of laws of the United States * * * and \\\\nthe Bureau of Prisons shall be responsible for [their] custody[. ]\\u201d  D.C. Code \\u00a7 24-101.   Therefore, \\\\npursuant to District of Columbia law, individuals sentenced by the Superior Court are intended to \\\\nbe \\u201csubject\\u201d to the same treatment as individuals sentenced by any of the federal district courts \\\\nand the BOP is charged with their custody and equal treatment.  \\\\n156.   There is no rational basis to treat Plaintiffs and proposed class members differently \\\\nthan BOP residents sentenced by federal district courts with regards to housing, programming \\\\nopportunities, and eligibility for home confinement.    \\\\n157.   Defendants\\u2019  policy  violates  the  Fifth  Amendment  because  it  treats  similarly \\\\nsituated parties disparately without a rational basis to do so.   \\\\n158.   The BOP acted without rational basis and contrary to equal protection principles \\\\nwhen it implemented a policy that significantly and disparately impacted the 95 percent Black \\\\npopulation of individuals with D.C. sentences.   By subjecting the majority Black population of \\\\nindividuals with D.C. sentences to a harsher criminal history scoring system, these individuals \\\\nhave systematically higher criminal history scores, higher security classifications, and more \\\\nrestrictive housing placements, than their majority-white federal counterparts.    \\\\n159.   Because of Defendants\\u2019 policy, Plaintiff and proposed class are more likely to be \\\\ndesignated to higher security level facilities with more rigorous constraints on their liberty, less \\\\n  30 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 31 of 33\\\\naccess to programming and work opportunities, less access to religious services, and more \\\\nviolence.   \\\\n160.   As a direct and proximate result of Defendants\\u2019 conduct, Plaintiff and the proposed \\\\nclass have suffered and will continue to suffer harm that is irreparable because the BOP\\u2019s criminal \\\\nhistory scoring rule is controlling and Plaintiff and the proposed class are unable to challenge their \\\\ncriminal history score, security classification, or facility designation in court. \\\\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\\\nACTION WITHOUT OBSERVANCE OF PROCEDURE REQUIRED BY LAW IN \\\\nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\\\n \\\\n161.   The APA requires the reviewing court \\u201cto hold unlawful and set aside\\u201d agency \\\\naction promulgated \\u201cwithout observance of procedure required by law.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(D).  \\\\n162.   The APA requires that legislative rules undergo a notice and comment period as \\\\npart of the rulemaking process.   5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 553.  \\\\n163.   The Defendants\\u2019 criminal history scoring rule (Program Statement 5100.08) is a \\\\nbinding,  legislative  rule  that  has  the  force  and  effect  of  law  because  it  provides  concrete, \\\\ncontrolling, singular guidance for calculating criminal history score, which has a direct and \\\\nsignificant impact on security classifications and places of imprisonment.    \\\\n164.   Defendants did not undergo a notice and comment period when adopting Program \\\\nStatement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule, and thus, the public, key stakeholders, including \\\\nfederal and D.C. agencies involved in criminal justice work, and those subject to the rule, could \\\\nnot participate or comment on the rule or its wide-ranging effects.  \\\\n165.   The challenged policy violates the APA and must be set aside because the BOP did \\\\nnot observe the required notice and comment process before adopting the policy.    \\\\n \\\\n  31 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 32 of 33\\\\nRELIEF REQUESTED \\\\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \\\\na.  Declare that the criminal history scoring rule for individuals with D.C. sentences \\\\npresented in Program Statement 5100.08, ch. 4, \\u00a7 8, is: \\\\n\\u2022  An arbitrary and capricious action, in violation of the Administrative Procedure \\\\nAct, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\\\n\\u2022  An action not in accordance with the law, in violation of the Administrative \\\\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\\\n\\u2022  An  action  not  in  accordance  with  the  Constitution,  in  violation  of  the \\\\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\\\n\\u2022  An action promulgated without observance of procedure required by law, in \\\\nviolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; and \\\\n\\u2022  Unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.   \\\\nb.  Vacate and set aside the separate criminal history scoring rule set forth in Program \\\\nStatement 5100.08, ch. 4, \\u00a7 8; \\\\nc.  Grant a preliminary injunction and permanent injunction preventing Defendant, its \\\\nsubordinates, agents, and employees from assessing the criminal history score of \\\\nindividuals sentenced by D.C.

The district court held that conditions in the\\\\nOklahoma prison system violated the Eighth Amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.  The\\\\n[1]\\\\nsubsequent history of the controversy is detailed in the opinions cited in the margin. \\\\nIn April, 1982, the district court entered an order that defendants \\\"should have and do hereby have the authority\\\\nindefinitely but not permanently to double-cell where necessary,\\\" 708 F.2d 1523 at 1526, following increases in\\\\nthe Oklahoma prison population.  In October, 1982, the district court issued an opinion following an evidentiary\\\\nhearing on its orders that had previously been entered.  The court stated that although it would not conclude from\\\\nthe evidence that the system had become unconstitutional in its operation, it was clearly in a state of decline.  708\\\\n1423 F.2d at 1539.  The court continued jurisdiction over the case to insure that the Oklahoma prison system did *1423\\\\nnot revert to an unconstitutional condition.  Id. The court ordered that a statement of penal policy and detailed plan\\\\nof action be filed. \\\\nThis court affirmed, one judge dissenting.  Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d 1523 (10th Cir.1983),cert. dismissed,465\\\\nU.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1019, 79 L.Ed.2d 248 (1984).  The majority of the panel held that the district court did not\\\\nabuse its discretion in continuing its jurisdiction to assure compliance with past decrees and to prevent a\\\\nrecurrence of unconstitutional conditions despite its finding that the system was then currently constitutional.  Id.\\\\nat 1537-40. \\\\nThe instant controversy concerns events following that decision.  In compliance with the district court\\\\'s order, the\\\\nState filed a detailed \\\"Plan of Measures to be Taken to Assure Continued Constitutionality of Oklahoma\\\\'s Prisons\\\"\\\\nin June, 1983, and in July the State filed a supplement to the Plan.  In September, 1983, the court held an\\\\nevidentiary hearing on the State\\\\'s Plan and the State\\\\'s motion to dismiss the case. Judge Bohanon recused in\\\\nDecember, 1983, and the case was assigned to Chief Judge Seay.  Following review of a portion of the record, he\\\\nentered the order on appeal herein on December 30. \\\\n\\\\nThe court concluded that \\\"since October 1982 to the present date the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma\\\\nprison system are constitutional and are not cruel and unusual punishment.\\\" X Jt.App. 237.  The court noted that\\\\nthere had been \\\"disturbances, problems, and inadequacies in the Oklahoma prison system since the court\\\\'s last\\\\nfindings.\\\" Id. at 235.  The court noted that there were four subjects of previous court orders still found to be\\\\ninadequate and not in compliance 00 racial integration, access to the courts, equal protection guarantees for\\\\n97\\\\nwomen, and vacating for human habitation the East and West Cellhouses of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\\\nMcAlester.  Id.\\\\nThe court concluded nevertheless that the system was constitutional and \\\"each area of continued violation has\\\\nbeen specifically addressed by the State and is subject to a specifically planned remedy.\\\" Id. The court found that\\\\nthe State legislature and prison officials were aware of and sensitive to the constitutional requirements and that\\\\nthe court was satisfied \\\"that there is no reasonable expectation that unconstitutional practices will recur in the\\\\nconditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system.\\\" Id. at 238.  Concluding that it was mindful of its\\\\nobligation to enforce the constitutional rights of all persons, the court granted defendants\\\\' motion to dismiss the\\\\ncase in its entirety.  However, the court concluded that \\\"[a]ll of this court\\\\'s orders and injunctions as modified\\\\nheretofore remain in full force and effect.\\\" Id. at 239. \\\\nIn May, 1984, the district court denied a motion by plaintiffs to stay the dismissal order.  Responding to a\\\\ncomplaint that the judge had not had the full record to review, the judge noted that he had had four of seven\\\\ntranscripts from the September hearing for review before entering the order; that he had all the transcripts\\\\ncontaining plaintiffs\\\\' case-in-chief; and that he had earlier had the transcript volume with the testimony of the\\\\nGovernor and the Director of the Corrections Department.  In denying the request for a stay, the court concluded\\\\nthat \\\"[a]fter a careful review and study of the entire transcript, the court finds no reason to change its order of\\\\nDecember 30, 1983, and the court reaffirms that order.\\\" Id. at 248.  The court stated that \\\"[a]lthough the court\\\\nnoted problems of compliance in certain areas, those areas were not held to be constitutional violations.\\\" Id.\\\\n(emphasis in original). \\\\nOn April 25, 1984, a panel of this court denied an application by the plaintiffs for a stay of the dismissal order,\\\\npending appeal.  On May 25, 1985, plaintiffs filed a further motion for a stay of the dismissal order, pending\\\\nappeal, contending that the State was housing inmates in the East and West Cellhouses in violation of the district\\\\ncourt\\\\'s order of May, 1979.  The State responded that the inmates were temporarily housed in those cellhouses\\\\n1424 on May 13, 1985, as a result of a disturbance at another *1424 State prison, and that the inmates were removed\\\\nfrom them on May 28.  Plaintiffs did not dispute these facts but did request that this court stay the dismissal order\\\\nnevertheless.  We denied the renewed application for a stay, stating that we would \\\"consider the propriety and\\\\nscope of the district court\\\\'s December 30, 1983, order in our disposition of the pending appeal in this cause.\\\" A\\\\nmotion to reconsider that ruling was filed, but in view of our disposition of the case the motion becomes moot.\\\\nWe turn now to the appellate arguments challenging the correctness of the district court\\\\'s order of dismissal. \\\\nII\\\\nPlaintiffs challenge the district court\\\\'s holding that the prison system is constitutional.  They argue that the system\\\\nis unconstitutional with respect to access to the courts, racial integration, and equal protection guarantees for\\\\nwomen 00 areas that the district court found to be \\\"inadequate and not in compliance\\\" with previous court orders. \\\\n97\\\\nPlaintiffs also contend that the Oklahoma prison system, considering the totality of the circumstances, is in\\\\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment. \\\\nA.\\\\n\\\\nAccess to the courts\\\\n[2]\\\\nPlaintiffs attack the defendants\\\\' reliance on inmate law clerks to provide meaningful access to the courts.   Brief\\\\nof Appellant 40-42; Reply Brief of Appellants 18-20.  We have previously noted, however, that \\\"[u]nder Bounds,\\\\nthe State is free to make a choice between affording law library facilities on a reasonable basis, or the alternative\\\\nmeans of having available counsel on a reasonable basis.\\\" Ward v. Kort, 762 F.2d 856, 860 (10th Cir.1985).  The\\\\ndistrict court\\\\'s dismissal order stated:\\\\nThe court finds that the mandated minimums of adequate library facilities has not yet been met. \\\\nBounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 [97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72] (1976).  However, testimony from\\\\nMr. Larry Meachum, Director of the Department of Corrections of Oklahoma, at the September\\\\n1983 hearing, indicates and assures this court that libraries will be fully stocked and that plaintiffs\\\\nhave and will be assured continued access to courts. \\\\nX Jt.App. 235.  In this connection, the defendants\\\\' Plan stated that the State intended \\\"to continue their current\\\\napproach to access to courts by providing both law libraries and trained inmate law clerks to assist inmates in\\\\nframing legal issues for presentation to the court.\\\" X R. 113; see id. at 113-14. \\\\nThere is record evidence that the Department of Corrections has a large or small library at each of the prison\\\\nfacilities.  Inventories were admitted in evidence as Defendants\\\\' Exhibits 29, 30, and 31 respecting the major law\\\\nlibraries at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center, and the Joseph Harp\\\\nCorrectional Center.  V Jt.App. 1041.  Each library has a supervisor.  The fact finder appointed by the district court\\\\nhad found an \\\"appalling lack of essential legal books and reference materials at both major and minor law\\\\nlibraries.\\\" VIII Jt.App. 119.  However, we note that the inventories do list a substantial volume of basic materials in\\\\nthe libraries.  See, e.g., Defendants\\\\' Exhibit 29 (containing extensive listing of law books at Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary Library).  Further, defendants\\\\' Plan represented to the court that \\\"the Department is continually\\\\n[3]\\\\nupdating and supplementing its law library inventories.\\\" X Jt.App. 114. \\\\n1425 *1425 In light of the testimony, the documentary evidence, and the representations accepted by the district court,\\\\nwe hold that the finding of the court that there was no constitutional violation in this respect is not in error. \\\\nB.\\\\nThe claim of racial discrimination\\\\nEarlier practices of racial discrimination in the Oklahoma prison system were chronicled in Battle v. Anderson,\\\\n376 F.Supp. at 410-11.  In that opinion, the district court made conclusions of law on these practices, id. at\\\\n420-21, and entered orders designed to remedy the discrimination.  Id. at 428-30.  The State has endeavored\\\\nsince those orders to comply with the constitutional requirements. \\\\nIn the instant proceeding there are numerous allegations of racial discrimination and segregation in the\\\\nOklahoma prison system, including discrimination in job assignments, dining hall seating, and cell assignments. \\\\nNumerous examples are contained in the fact finder\\\\'s March 1983 final compliance report, VIII Jt.App. 25-43, and\\\\nin the arguments and record citations in the briefs of the plaintiffs-appellants in this phase of the controversy. \\\\nBrief of Appellants 15-16, 43; Reply Brief of Appellants 12-14.  The State and the United States as intervenor\\\\nargue that the evidence supports a finding of nondiscrimination.  Brief of State Defendants-Appellees 101-02;\\\\nBrief for the United States as Appellee 26-28. \\\\nIn addition, the plaintiffs-appellants argue that the trial court did not address these issues in the December 30,\\\\n1983 order of dismissal.  In that regard, we note that the district court did make the following findings and\\\\nconclusions respecting this claim of racial discrimination:\\\\n\\\\nRacial integration of the occupants of double cells is found to be almost non-existent in the\\\\nOklahoma prison system.  Racial integration of cells is strictly by voluntary action only.  However, a\\\\ncommitment by defendants to fully integrate is contained in the Defendants\\\\' Plan.  The court finds\\\\nthe Defendants\\\\' Plan to be of sufficient remedial effect and has previously, in this order, approved\\\\nand ordered its adoption. \\\\nX Jt.App. 235. \\\\nIn view of the findings quoted above, we cannot agree with the plaintiffs-appellants that the trial court did not\\\\naddress the racial discrimination claim at all. Nevertheless, because of the several distinct questions clearly\\\\nraised by the fact finder\\\\'s findings and the specific issues joined by the parties, we must agree that the findings of\\\\nthe district court are not sufficient under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.  We cannot perform our appellate function\\\\nwithout adequate findings and conclusions by the trial court on this issue of fundamental constitutional\\\\nimportance.  Battle v. Anderson, 614 F.2d 251, 256 (10th Cir.1980); Squirtco v. Seven-Up Co., 628 F.2d 1086,\\\\n1902 (8th Cir.1980).  Without expressing any view on the validity of the constitutional claim of racial discrimination,\\\\nwe hold that the findings and conclusions thereon are not sufficient due to the sharp conflict on the several claims\\\\nof specific discriminatory treatment not addressed by the trial judge.\\\\nAccordingly, with respect to this claim of racial discrimination, the judgment of dismissal must be vacated and the\\\\ncase remanded on that claim for such further proceedings as the district court deems proper.  In view of the\\\\nintervening time lapse it may well be desirable that further evidence on this claim be received.  After the further\\\\nproceedings which the trial court finds proper are held, the district judge should then find the facts specially and\\\\nstate separately his conclusions thereon in detail, dealing with the various claims of racial discrimination in\\\\naccordance with Rule 52(a). \\\\nC.\\\\nThe claim of sex discrimination\\\\n1426 Under the Equal Protection Clause, the plaintiffs-appellants argue vigorously *1426 that women inmates in the\\\\nOklahoma prison system are subjected to discrimination in conditions of confinement, job assignments, training\\\\nprograms, mental and medical health services, and recreation.  These were objections made by the plaintiffs to\\\\ndeficiencies in the fact finder\\\\'s final compliance report.  X Jt.App. 58-61.  The specific claims arise from the fact\\\\nthat the State in a stipulation had agreed not to discriminate against inmates on various grounds, including sex,\\\\nand had agreed further to provide equal access to various programs and work assignments.  Brief of Appellants\\\\n22; Brief for the United States as Appellee 30 n. 22. \\\\nThe district court\\\\'s order of dismissal contains the following discussion of this issue:\\\\nThe court finds that equal protection guarantees for women inmates are inadequate in terms of\\\\nprograms, medical care, and exercise.  However, Director Meachum testified there is a $62,000.00\\\\ncurrent special appropriation for women\\\\'s programs and detailed the specific remedies outlined in\\\\nthe Defendants\\\\' Plan.  The court finds the proposed measures will continue constitutionality. \\\\nX Jt.App. 236. \\\\nWith respect to the claim of violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the treatment of women inmates, we feel\\\\nthat the findings are not inadequate.  The trial court specifically found inadequacies in terms of programs, medical\\\\ncare, and exercise.  We feel that the remaining claims of inadequate housing were thus implicitly rejected. \\\\nFurthermore, the trial judge specifically identified the testimony which he credited, that of Director Meachum.  His\\\\ntestimony concerning a $62,000 current special appropriation for women\\\\'s programs was identified.  Moreover,\\\\nthe court concluded that the program laid out by Director Meachum would be constitutionally sufficient.  We note\\\\nthat Director Meachum\\\\'s testimony explained the reason for not having an intermediate health unit for the Mabel\\\\n\\\\nBassett facility in the Oklahoma City area.  He pointed out that they had a psychiatrist assigned to the Mabel\\\\nBassett facility addressing the mental health needs of women.  VII Jt.App. 95-97. \\\\nOn consideration of the evidence relied on by the plaintiffs, the evidence cited by the trial judge, and the resolve\\\\nshown in the testimony of Director Meachum to solve the problem, we cannot say that the findings and\\\\nconclusions of the trial judge on this constitutional claim were in error. \\\\nD.\\\\nThe Eighth Amendment claim\\\\nPlaintiffs further vigorously challenge the findings and conclusions of the district court which rejected their claim\\\\nthat the totality of the circumstances in the Oklahoma prison system amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in\\\\nviolation of the prohibition of the Eighth Amendment.  More specifically, they seriously complain about\\\\novercrowding, food and kitchen facilities, ventilation, educational and training programs, medical and mental\\\\nhealth services, and the occupation temporarily of the East and West Cellhouses at the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary in violation of the May 4, 1979 order of Judge Bohanon. \\\\nIn connection with this constitutional claim and the detailed complaints made, the district court\\\\'s findings and\\\\nconclusions against the plaintiffs were as follows:\\\\n[T]he court finds that management problems exist in the Oklahoma system.  Problem areas can be\\\\ndetermined in food preparation and service, maintenance of equipment and facilities, distribution\\\\nof clothing and essential supplies, and inmate idleness.  These management problems exist\\\\ndespite the extremely professional staff of the Oklahoma prison system.  These problems are\\\\nfound to be primarily a direct result of increases in prison population. \\\\nUnfortunately, there will always be problems and inadequacies.  We are considering a large,\\\\nconfined population of convicted felons, not a nursery school.  As noted by Judge Barrett, \\\"The \\\\n1427 Rhodes majority observed that harsh or restrictive *1427 conditions of confinement are part of the\\\\npunishment criminal offenders justly receive because the Constitution does not mandate\\\\ncomfortable prisons.  Justice Powell wrote that `To the extent that such conditions [of confinement]\\\\nare restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their\\\\noffenses against society.\\\\' 452 U.S. [337] at p. 347 [101 S.Ct. 2392 at p. 2399, 69 L.Ed.2d 59].\\\" Battle v. Anderson, supra at page 1535. \\\\nThe court finds, considering the totality of circumstances, these inadequacies, problems, and\\\\nshortcomings do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the test of Rhodes.  Rhodes v.\\\\nChapman, supra at page 347 [101 S.Ct. at page 2399].  The court finds no evidence at this time to\\\\nshow that the plaintiffs\\\\' present conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system have\\\\nchanged from one of constitutionality to unconstitutionality.  Thus, the court finds that since\\\\nOctober 1982 to the present date the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system\\\\nare constitutional and are not cruel and unusual punishment. \\\\nX Jt.App. 236-37. \\\\nFor reasons we will outline generally, from our review of the record testimony and exhibits, and from the\\\\narguments about the record evidence by plaintiffs, we conclude that the district court\\\\'s findings were not clearly\\\\nerroneous, that the conclusions drawn were supported by the findings and record, and that the determination of\\\\nthe court to dismiss the cause in its entirety, retaining in full force and effect the prior orders and injunctions\\\\nagainst constitutional violations, was not in error. \\\\nWe have noted that there are specific complaints concerning conditions of confinement, including overcrowding,\\\\nfood and kitchen facilities, ventilation, educational and training programs, medical and mental health services,\\\\nand the temporary occupancy of the East and West Cellhouses.  See Brief of Appellants 4-22, 30-36.  However,\\\\n\\\\nthe ban on cruel and unusual punishment prohibits conditions that \\\"involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction\\\\nof pain, [or are] grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment.\\\" Rhodes v.\\\\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2399, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); see Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312,\\\\n___-___, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 1082-86, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986).  Although prison inmates may not be deprived of the\\\\n\\\"minimal civilized measure of life\\\\'s necessities,.. conditions that cannot be said to be cruel and unusual under\\\\ncontemporary standards are not unconstitutional.  To the extent that such conditions are restrictive and even\\\\nharsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.\\\" Rhodes v.\\\\nChapman, 452 U.S. at 347, 101 S.Ct. at 2399. \\\\nA little over two years ago a panel of this court agreed that the overall conditions of the Oklahoma prison system\\\\nat that time were constitutional.  Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d at 1533, 1537.  We have considered the plaintiffs\\\\'\\\\ncomplaints and the arguments in their briefs concerning the evidence in this subsequent case and are not\\\\nconvinced that the findings of the district court are clearly erroneous.  The State defendants and the intervenor\\\\nUnited States have persuasively argued that the evidence of record does not demonstrate conditions of\\\\nconfinement constituting cruel and unusual punishment under the strict standard of Rhodes v. Chapman.  See\\\\n[4]\\\\nBrief of Defendants-Appellees 2-88; Brief for the United States as Appellee 15-23. \\\\n1428 *1428 We note one item in particular, the complaint that facilities at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary were not air-\\\\nconditioned.  The complaint concerning the heat was covered by the testimony of Mr. Hutto.  The testimony was\\\\nthat the new housing units at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary were air-conditioned.  IV Jt.App. 597.  The East and\\\\nWest Cellhouses were not air-conditioned, but as discussed below, they were vacated, except for limited\\\\nemergency use, in compliance with the orders of Judge Bohanon. \\\\nWith respect to the East and West Cellhouses, the May 4, 1979 order of Judge Bohanon was that the State no\\\\nlonger house inmates at those East and West Cellhouses due to the inadequate facilities there.  In the dismissal\\\\norder of December 30, 1983, the district court noted that the State was not in compliance with that order, but was\\\\nsatisfied from the assurances of Director Meachum and Governor Nigh that the cellhouses would be vacated as\\\\nsoon as feasible.  X Jt.App. 236. \\\\nOn May 25, 1985, plaintiffs filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in this court stating that inmates were being\\\\nhoused in the East and West Cellhouses in violation of the May 4, 1979 order.  The State responded to that\\\\nmotion, representing that the inmates were placed in the cellhouses on May 13, 1985, as the result of a\\\\ndisturbance at another state prison and that the inmates were removed from these East and West Cellhouses on\\\\nMay 28.  Plaintiffs did not challenge these representations. \\\\nThere was a further motion for a stay filed December 27, 1985, in which the plaintiffs again represented that\\\\nsome inmates had been placed into the East and West Cellhouses.  However, this was again related to a riot\\\\nproblem and the defendants informed the plaintiffs\\\\' counsel that the forty-three inmates housed in the East\\\\nCellhouse following the riot were all removed by January 6, 1986.  See Response of the United States to\\\\nAppellants\\\\' Motion to Reconsider Order Denying Stay Pending Appeal 3.  There was no dispute of those facts\\\\nconcerning the removal of the inmates from the East Cellhouse after the problem of temporary occupancy.  We\\\\ntherefore conclude that the complaint concerning the East and West Cellhouses is not supported in our record,\\\\nand we are not persuaded that these temporary emergency uses of the cellhouses should be held a\\\\nconstitutional violation. \\\\nIn sum, we are not persuaded by the arguments of the plaintiffs and the evidence that the findings of the district\\\\ncourt that there was no violation of the Eighth Amendment were clearly erroneous.  In addition, we are not\\\\nconvinced that there was an abuse of discretion by the district court in determining to dismiss the cause as he\\\\n[5]\\\\ndid, retaining in force and effect the prior orders and injunctions against constitutional violations.   The majority\\\\nin Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d at 1537, concluded that \\\"a court should exercise supervisory power over the suit\\\\nuntil it can say with assurance not only that eighth amendment violations do not presently exist but there is no\\\\nreasonable expectation that unconstitutional conditions will recur.\\\" In dealing with the various issues before him,\\\\nthe district judge concluded that he was satisfied that the defendants intended permanent compliance with\\\\nconstitutional conditions in the Oklahoma prison system.  X Jt.App. 232, 234-37.  The Memorandum Opinion and\\\\n\\\\n1429 Order *1429 stated that \\\"this court finds that it is now satisfied that there is no reasonable expectation that\\\\nunconstitutional practices will recur in the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system.\\\" Id. at 238. \\\\nWe are convinced that the district court\\\\'s conclusion was based on findings supported by the record and that the\\\\ndetermination to dismiss in these circumstances was not in error or an abuse of discretion. \\\\nIII\\\\nAs noted, there was a motion for a stay of the district court\\\\'s dismissal order filed on May 25, 1985, by the\\\\nplaintiffs.  This court denied that motion, as noted, stating that we would consider the propriety and scope of the\\\\ndistrict court\\\\'s December 30, 1983 order of dismissal in our disposition of the pending appeal.  On December 27,\\\\n1985, the plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider that order denying the May 25, 1985 motion for a stay.  Because of\\\\nthe disposition we are making in this opinion, we find that motion now to be moot.\\\\nIn addition, on February 4, 1986, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial remand for the district court to make an\\\\nappropriate award of attorney\\\\'s fees pendente lite.  In view of the fact that this court was proceeding to disposition\\\\nof the case, we have deferred a ruling on that motion.  Since we are making a partial remand of the case, the\\\\nplaintiffs will have the opportunity to have the district court consider a further application of attorney\\\\'s fees when\\\\nthose proceedings on remand occur.  The trial judge should entertain any such motion with those proceedings. \\\\nIV\\\\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated we make the following determinations and order as follows:\\\\n1.  The order of dismissal of December 30, 1983, by the district court, which retained in full force and effect the\\\\nprevious orders and injunctions protecting the rights of the plaintiffs against constitutional violations, is\\\\nAFFIRMED except with respect to the claim of racial discrimination discussed in Part II-B of this opinion.  The\\\\nplaintiffs may by further proceedings in the district court seek relief from any violations of those previous orders\\\\nand injunctions protecting their constitutional rights. \\\\n2.', '  The majority\\\\nin Battle v.

Anderson, 376 F.Supp. 402 (E.D.Okla.1974), the\\\\nlitigation concerning constitutional compliance has been ongoing.  See Battle v. Anderson, 447 F.Supp. 516\\\\n(E.D.Okla. ),aff\\\\'d,564 F.2d 388 (10th Cir.1977); Battle v. Anderson, 457 F.Supp. 719 (E.D.Okla.1978),remanded\\\\nfor further hearings,594 F.2d 786 (10th Cir.1979); Battle v. Anderson, 614 F.2d 251 (10th Cir.1980); Battle v.\\\\nAnderson, 708 F.2d 1523 (10th Cir.1983) (per curiam), cert. dismissed,465 U.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1019, 79\\\\nL.Ed.2d 248 (1984); see also Battle v. Anderson, 541 F.Supp. 1061 (E.D.Okla.1982) (award of attorneys\\\\' fees). \\\\n[2] The constitutional right of access to the courts has been found to rest on the guarantees of the Due Process\\\\nClauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  See Ward v. Kort, 762 F.2d 856, 858 (10th Cir.1985). \\\\n[3] In addition to the inventories of materials at the libraries, we note that the handbook \\\"Civil Procedure for\\\\nInmate Legal Research Assistants\\\" itself covered basic principles on federal habeas corpus with chapters on the\\\\nexhaustion doctrine, procedural default, issues cognizable, pleadings, preliminary procedure, and evidentiary\\\\n\\\\nhearings.  Statutory materials and summaries on various cases from the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals\\\\non habeas proceedings were also included. \\\\n[4] The plaintiffs argue that they were denied due process when Chief Judge Seay entered his order of dismissal\\\\nafter having received only four of seven transcripts of the hearing held earlier before Judge Bohanon.  Judge\\\\nSeay had before him at the time of his dismissal the transcripts of the plaintiffs\\\\' entire case in chief, among other\\\\nthings, and the testimony of Governor Nigh and Director Meachum, and the exhibits were apparently available,\\\\nincluding those we have cited earlier concerning access to the courts.  In addition, in his ruling a few months later\\\\non the motion to stay his order, which was denied, the judge stated that he had at that time reviewed the entire\\\\ntranscript of all the proceedings before Judge Bohanon. \\\\n[5] As noted, the district court here expressly stated that \\\"[a]ll of this court\\\\'s orders and injunctions as modified\\\\nheretofore remain in full force and effect.\\\" X Jt.App. 239.  This is in accord with the principle that \\\"[i]t has long\\\\nbeen settled that the court\\\\'s power to grant injunctive relief survives discontinuance of the illegal conduct.  E.g., \\\\nUnited States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1952).\\\" Battle v. Anderson,\\\\n708 F.2d at 1538 n. 4.  If the district court had intended any dissolution of the prior orders, its order \\\"should have\\\\ncontained a definite provision for the dissolution\\\" of those provisions.  Tucker v. Baker, 185 F.2d 863, 865 (5th\\\\nCir.1950).  We are convinced that it is unmistakenbly clear that the orders and injunctions protecting the inmates\\\\nagainst constitutional violations, as previously modified, were in no way intended to be relaxed and that they\\\\nremain in full force and effect. \\\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar. \\\\n\\\\nDocument Title: Opinion\\\\nDocument Content: \\\\n564 F.2d 388 (1977)\\\\nBobby BATTLE, Plaintiff-Appellee,\\\\nv.\\\\nPark J.

The State of Oklahoma, following its filing of its\\\\nNotice of Appeal, moved this court for a stay of the Order of June 14, 1977, which was granted and is yet in force\\\\nand effect.  The appeal and motion for stay were combined for hearing before this court which was held on August\\\\n23, 1977.  The Stay Order has been continued pending disposition of the appeal on the merits. \\\\nThe genesis of the District Court\\\\'s Order of June 14, 1977, is a Motion for Emergency Supplemental Relief filed\\\\nby plaintiff Bobby Battle wherein he alleged \\\"overcrowding\\\" of the inmate population at the state penitentiary.  The\\\\nchallenged Order was entered following full evidentiary hearing.  It contains specific findings, inter alia, relative to\\\\nthe minimum amount of cell space required per prison inmate and, measured thereby, the District Court specially\\\\nfound that as of the May 23 hearing the Oklahoma prison system contained about 4,600 inmates in a system\\\\ndesigned for 2,400, constituting an overcrowding situation of 191 percent.  In addition to the overcrowding crisis,\\\\nthe Court found various and sundry physical and environmental conditions existing throughout the system which\\\\nwere offensive and substandard.  The Court specially found that the overcrowding condition had reached such\\\\nproportions that it constituted a per se unconstitutional condition violative of the Eighth Amendment commands\\\\nprohibiting cruel and unusual punishment.  The Order and Judgment required the State of Oklahoma to achieve\\\\nspecific goals in the reduction of inmate population commencing August, 1977, more fully hereinafter set forth. \\\\nOn appeal, the appellant, State of Oklahoma, alleges error on the part of the District Court in that: (1) the\\\\nevidence does not support a finding that there is a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States\\\\nConstitution, (2) appellants were denied a fair hearing, (3) findings of fact were erroneously made because the\\\\n\\\\ntrial court was misled and unduly swayed by the consideration of inadmissible exhibits and, further, because the\\\\nfacts were for the most part unsubstantiated by competent testimony of the witnesses, and (4) the court should\\\\nhave accepted the State\\\\'s Plan as consented per agreement reached between the State and the appellees. \\\\nThe seriousness of this matter is recognized by all parties concerned.  This court, just as the trial court, is\\\\ncognizant of the strain placed upon the federal-state relationship.  We echo the consistent emphasis of the District\\\\nCourt relating to its reluctance to usurp or interfere with an area historically within the domain and control of the\\\\nsovereign states.  It is in this context that we must judge whether, from the record before us, there exists such a\\\\ncompelling interest in the protection of federal constitutional rights that the Order of the District Court must be\\\\nupheld.  A somewhat detailed recital of the factual-procedural background leading to this opinion should help in\\\\nplacing this difficult case in proper perspective. \\\\nThe initial complaint alleged civil rights deprivations under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 challenging the Oklahoma State\\\\n392 Penitentiary and penal system.  It was filed by Bobby *392 Battle, pro se, on April 24, 1972, when he was a\\\\nprisoner at the penitentiary.  He complained on behalf of himself and other inmates that they were deprived of\\\\nrights secured by the federal constitution and civil rights laws.  The action sought injunctive relief to correct the\\\\nclaimed deprivations and to obtain monetary damages.  The defendants were various Oklahoma officials\\\\nperforming duties relating to the state\\\\'s penal and correctional institutions and system.  Upon motion and hearing,\\\\nthe United States was permitted to intervene on March 5, 1974.  The complaint in intervention filed by the United\\\\nStates alleged that the defendants (the State of Oklahoma, in effect) had discriminated against black inmates in a\\\\nnumber of instances.  The trial of said cause commenced March 14, 1974, and concluded on March 15th.  It had\\\\nbeen preceded by extensive pre-trial discovery including depositions, inspections and investigations conducted\\\\nby attorneys, FBI agents and experts in penology.  The District Court made extensive findings and conclusions\\\\nleading to its Order, generally finding for the plaintiffs.  The Order directed the defendants to undertake certain\\\\nremedial steps, granting them adequate opportunity within which to comply.  Nothing in that proceeding, however,\\\\ninvolved the general contention of prison inmate overcrowding, per se. The Court did deal with conditions existing\\\\nin the \\\"solitary confinement\\\" or \\\"the hole\\\" isolation area of the penitentiary, noting that those confined in such\\\\ndark, unventilated and unsanitary isolation cells were being subjected to intolerable treatment.  The Order also\\\\nreached and disposed of contentions going to racial discrimination and segregation, disciplinary rules,\\\\npunishment and procedure, administrative lockup, use of chemical agents, medical care, correspondence rights,\\\\npublications, access to the courts, and religious freedom.  In apparent reliance on the rule that a \\u00a7 1983 civil rights\\\\naction in Federal District Court is supplemental to any other available remedy, no challenge to the federal court\\\\'s\\\\njurisdiction has at any time been raised or urged on the grounds of exhaustion of available state remedies or as a\\\\nmatter of abstention.  At oral arguments before this court, counsel for the State of Oklahoma did state belief that\\\\nsimilar remedies are available to the inmates under the laws of the State of Oklahoma.  It was acknowledged,\\\\nhowever, that at no time or in anywise was the Federal District Court below moved or requested to invoke\\\\nabstention or exhaustion of available state remedies.  At oral argument, counsel for Bobby Battle, et al.,\\\\ncontended that there are no remedies available under the laws of Oklahoma comparable to the class action\\\\nremedies which may be compelled in a \\u00a7 1983 proceeding.  In any event, it is clear that the parties have acceded\\\\nto the District Court\\\\'s jurisdiction throughout these proceedings. \\\\nThe District Court expressed the reluctance of federal courts to intervene in matters of prison administration, but\\\\nobserved that the United States Supreme Court had held that a policy of judicial restraint on the part of the\\\\nfederal courts in refraining from interference with state penal authorities in their administration of a state\\\\'s penal\\\\nsystem was not a justifiable basis for failure to take cognizance of valid federal constitutional claims relating to\\\\nrights secured to inmates by the federal constitution and the laws of the United States.  Procunier v. Martinez, 417\\\\nU.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263\\\\n(1972); Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969).  The District Court retained\\\\njurisdiction, including that for \\\"determination of all issues not dealt with expressly herein.\\\" The trial court\\\\'s\\\\nmemorandum opinion consumed 30 pages, reported as Battle v. Anderson, 376 F.Supp. 402 (1974). \\\\nWe, too, abhor any situation or circumstance requiring the intervention of the federal courts in matters involving\\\\nthe administration, control and maintenance by the sovereign states of their penal systems.  It is a delicate role\\\\nassigned to the federal courts to display that restraint so necessary \\\"in the maintenance of proper federal-state\\\\n393 relations.\\\" Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963).  We are *393 cognizant of the\\\\n\\\\ncomplexity of problems confronting the states in upgrading not only a host of state institutions and facilities but in\\\\nproperly maintaining them both physically and with adequate personnel.  If we were to close our eyes to the\\\\nfinancial burdens a variety of \\\"piecemeal\\\" federal court orders would impose upon the states and their taxpayers\\\\nwe would refuse to come to grips with reality.  We are in sympathy with the ever increasing budgetary demands\\\\nupon state taxpayers.  There are constitutional and statutory limits on a state\\\\'s capacity to finance capital outlays. \\\\nNo one state governmental body is authorized to dictate a specific course of action.  The governmental wheels\\\\noften turn slowly simply as a result of pressure generated by a multitude of needs.  Those charged with the\\\\nadministration of state government must pick and choose, set priorities and goals, many of which must later be\\\\nabandoned or delayed because of unforeseen emergencies.  Thus, it is in recognition of these problems and\\\\npressures that this court is sincerely reluctant to enter the arena involving the issues presented.  The fact is,\\\\nhowever, that the issues are jurisdictionally before us, just as they were jurisdictionally before the District Court.\\\\nThey have not been invited or solicited.  We are guided by the fact that the United States Supreme Court has not\\\\nwavered in its holding that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibiting the imposition of\\\\ncruel and unusual punishment is, inter alia, intended to protect and safeguard a prison inmate from an\\\\nenvironment where degeneration is probable and self-improvement unlikely because of the conditions existing\\\\nwhich inflict needless suffering, whether physical or mental.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50\\\\nL.Ed.2d 251 (1976); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). \\\\nThe District Court made particular reference to a serious riot which occurred at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary\\\\nin 1973 when it entered its Supplemental Order of June 14, 1977, following Plaintiff\\\\'s Motion for Supplemental\\\\nRelief as to Crowding:\\\\nThe conditions which precipitated and caused the disastrous riot of 1973 at McAlester now prevail\\\\nthroughout the system.  In the hearings conducted by the court in 1974 prior to its May 30, 1974\\\\nOrder (376 F.Supp. 402) the court heard the shocking details of the conditions existing prior to the\\\\nriot and became convinced that the neglect, apathy and deliberate disregard for human decency\\\\nand rights contributed directly to the tragic loss of lives and $20 million in state property damages. \\\\nIt is now equally convinced that the inmate conditions now existing present an immediate and\\\\nintolerable threat to the safety and security of inmates, prison personnel and the people of the\\\\nState of Oklahoma with attendant monetary losses and costs of staggering proportions. \\\\nIn its 1974 opinion in Battle v. Anderson, supra, the District Court noted that during a period of seven months prior\\\\nto the 1973 riot at the penitentiary the inmate population at the main facility averaged about 1778; that two of the\\\\ngeneral population cellhouses were constructed in 1907 and the third and fourth units were added in 1932 and\\\\n1935, providing a design capacity of 1200 inmates. \\\\nIn its Memorandum Opinion of June 14, 1977, from which this appeal was generated, the Trial Court observed\\\\nthat the State of Oklahoma made significant progress in many of the concerned areas included in the original\\\\norder, while failing to do so in other areas; that since the May 30, 1974, order the court had conducted periodic\\\\nhearings at approximately six month intervals; and that evidence concerning the problem of overcrowding and\\\\nconditions of confinement was entertained and presented on May 4, 1976, and October 14-15, 1976, and that\\\\neven though the Court did not issue any orders at those times, \\\"it clearly indicated to the defendants that the then\\\\nexisting population levels and conditions were intolerable and that the court was considering the issuance of an\\\\n394 injunction\\\" and \\\"In the interim the problem kept going.\\\" The court found that as of May 23, *394 1977, the State of\\\\nOklahoma was housing inmates at seven (7) separate facilities totalling 4,600 in facilities with design capacity not\\\\nin excess of 2,400.  Much of this data was obtained from an exhibit constituting a letter from the Director of the\\\\nOklahoma Department of Corrections dated March 22, 1977.  The court observed that it had deferred since May\\\\n30, 1974, from entering specific orders in the hope that the commended vigorous leadership of Warden Crisp and\\\\nDirector Benton would, in effect, move the \\\"powers that be\\\" to correct those abuses, but that the court learned in\\\\nOctober, 1976, that even though the State Board of Corrections in its FY78 Budget had labeled conditions within\\\\nthe Department a \\\"shame and disgrace\\\" to the State of Oklahoma, the crisis was still such that the physical and\\\\nmental health of each inmate was impaired.  The court found that each resident living in a cell should have a\\\\nminimum of 60 square feet of sleeping space and each resident of a dormitory should have 75 square feet, as\\\\nfound by the State Department of Corrections to be the absolute minimum; that certain facilities then in being\\\\nwere woefully inadequate, rendering treatment of inmates there imprisoned cruel and unusual.  The Trial Court\\\\n\\\\nlent considerable credibility to the expert testimony of Theodore James Gordon, an environmental health\\\\nspecialist, Frederick D. Moyer, an architect, and Charles Robert Sarver, a professor of law and sociology and a\\\\nformer correctional administrator.  The court recited in detail the conditions of confinement at each prison facility, i. \\\\ne., the McAlester complex, Granite, Lexington, Quachita, McLeod and Stringtown.  The Court\\\\'s Conclusions of\\\\nLaw and Order and Judgment of June 14, 1977, are as follows:\\\\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\\\\n1.  The Court has the authority and duty to insure that the Constitution does not stop at the prison\\\\ngate, but rather inures to the benefit of all, even to those citizens behind prison walls, Jackson v.\\\\nGodwin, 400 F.2d 529, 532 (5th Cir. 1968),Finney v. Arkansas Board of Education [Correction],\\\\n505 F.2d 194 (8th Cir. 1974). \\\\n2.  In implementing the Constitution, courts have required that certain penal facilities be closed, \\\\nRhem v. Malcolm, 371 F.Supp. 594 (S.D.N.Y. 1974)aff\\\\'d507 F.2d 333 (2nd Cir. 1974),Gates v.\\\\nCollier, 390 F.Supp. 482 (N.D.Miss. 1974), and Hamilton v. Landrieu, 351 F.Supp. 549 (E.D.La.\\\\n1972); that inmates be housed in single cells, instead of multiple inmates in a cell, Inmates of\\\\nSuffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, 360 F.Supp. 676 (D.Mass. 1973)aff\\\\'d,494 F.2d 1196 (1st Cir.\\\\n1974), and Valvano v. Malcolm, 520 F.2d 392 (2nd Cir. 1975) that prison population be limited to a\\\\nfixed number, e. g., Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, 406 F.Supp. 649 (S.D.Tex. 1975); or that\\\\ninmates be afforded a fixed minimum amount square footage (see cases cited at conclusion of law\\\\n6). \\\\n3.  Courts have also evaluated quality of life in penal facilities and demanded a healthy\\\\nenvironment with adequate sanitation, ventilation, lighting and utilities, Williams v. Edwards, 547\\\\nF.2d 120 [1206] (5th Cir. 1977); regarding ventilation Rhem v. Malcolm, supra, Hamilton v. Love,\\\\n328 F.Supp. 1182 (E.D.Ark. 1971) and Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, supra. Vermin\\\\ninfestations, Miller v. Carson, 401 F.Supp. 835, (M.D.Fla. 1975) and Hamilton v. Landrieu, supra.\\\\nSee also Rozechi v. Gaughan, 459 F.2d 6 (1st Cir. 1970) and Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 387\\\\n(M.D.Ala. 1972)aff\\\\'d sub nom. Wyatt v. Aderholt, 523 [503] F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1974). \\\\n4.  Courts have grappled with the problems and the conditions of confinement in three ways. \\\\nConditions have been found to be per se unconstitutional.  E. g., Rhem, supra, conditions as\\\\nexacerbated by overpopulation have found to be unconstitutional, E. g., Williams v. Edwards,\\\\nsupra, Finney v. Arkansas Board of Corrections, supra, and Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp. 318\\\\n(M.D.Ala. 1976).  Overcrowding per se has been found to be unconstitutional, Gates v. Collier,\\\\nsupra, McCray v. Sullivan, supra, and Finney v. Arkansas Board of Corrections, supra. This Court\\\\n395 finds that all three of these *395 cases are existent within the Oklahoma Department of\\\\nCorrections. \\\\n5.  In the original Order the Court ordered the closing of certain cells at McAlester.  Likewise, the\\\\nwooden facility at Lexington with its severe environmental and fire hazards shocks the Court\\\\'s\\\\nconscience and must be closed upon completion of the new Lexington A & R unit. \\\\n6.  The crowding in Oklahoma has reached such proportions that this Court could easily find, as\\\\nother courts have, that the crowding is per se unconstitutional.  Certainly where prisoners are\\\\nforced to sleep in garages, barber shops, libraries and stairwells; and where they are placed in\\\\ndormitories without any toilet and shower facilities the crowding has passed the constitutional\\\\nthreshold.  The Court is equally or more offended by the housing of two men within a little 35-40\\\\nsquare foot \\\"cubbyhole\\\".  Such crowding offends the contemporary standards of human decency, \\\\nTrop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, [78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630] (1958). \\\\nThe effects of the crowding as it relates to the conditions of confinement with regard to the health,\\\\nsafety, and security of the inmates is unconstitutional.  The crowding has caused the kitchen, water\\\\nand sewer systems to be overtaxed.  The dining facilities, if they were outside the prison walls\\\\nwould be closed down as immediate health dangers.  Individuals are housed in substandard living\\\\n\\\\nquarters which are firetraps.  However, there is no plan or possibility of putting out the fire if a\\\\nmajor one occurred. \\\\nThere is a direct correlation between overcrowding and violence, see finding of fact 16, supra.\\\\nDefendants acknowledge that the 1973 McAlester riot was caused by the then existing\\\\novercrowded conditions at the O.S.P. This court would be remiss in its duties if it did not move to\\\\nact on the problems, but rather sat idly by until the increasing crowding caused another major\\\\nincident to sweep the Oklahoma Prison system. \\\\n7.  The court adopts the standards of the American Public Health Association for living space and\\\\nenvironmental matters.  APHA calls for 60 square feet in a cell and 75 square feet in a dormitory.  In\\\\nadopting the APHA 60\\\\'/75\\\\' standards respectively, the Court is mindful that most other\\\\norganizations and many of the courts who have faced this problem have adopted higher\\\\nstandards.6\\\\n6 Organizational standards:\\\\n70 sq. feet: National Sheriff\\\\'s Association at 63 (1975)\\\\n70 sq. feet: Building Officials and Code Administrators, Inc., BOCA Basic Building Code, 1975 \\u00a7\\\\n201.3\\\\n70 sq. feet: National Clearinghouse for Criminal Justice Planning and Architecture. \\\\n75 sq. feet: The American Correctional Association Manual of Correctional Standards 49\\\\n80 sq. feet: National Advisory Commission for Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Corrections,\\\\nStandard 11.1, page 353\\\\n90 sq. feet: The International Conference of Building Officials, Uniform Building Code \\u00a7 1307B, p.\\\\n83\\\\nCases:\\\\n60 sq. feet: Pugh v. Locke, supra.\\\\n75 sq. feet: Ambrose v. Malcolm, 414 F.Supp. 485 (S.D.N.Y. (1976). \\\\n88 sq. feet: Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, supra.\\\\n8.  In adopting the APHA environmental standards, the Court points out that a prison facility is a\\\\nclosed ecosystem.  Persons are sent to prison as punishment, not for punishment.  It is incumbent\\\\non the incarcerating body to provide the individual with a healthy habilitative environment. \\\\nAnything less would be to subject the individual to further punishment than was given by the\\\\nsentencing trial court. With habilitation assured, then possibly or probably the inmate can decide\\\\nto rehabilitate himself. \\\\nBut if the basic habilitative needs of the individual are not met then rehabilitation, reformation or\\\\nredemption are not possible.  Water, fire protection, air and food are necessities of life. Minimum\\\\nspace to call one\\\\'s own is a primary psychological necessity.  Without the basic minimums prisons\\\\nare doomed to failure, with both society and the inmates incarcerated therein the losers. \\\\n9.  This Court is well aware of the financial restraints placed on the Defendants and their efforts to\\\\n396 comply with the *396 Constitution.  But the good will shown by the Defendants cannot serve as a\\\\ndefense.  Finney v. Arkansas Board of Correction, supra; Rozechi v. Gaughan, supra; Holt v.\\\\nSarver, 309 F.Supp. 362, 385 (E.D.Ark., 1972); and Davis v. Lindsay, 321 F.Supp. 1134, 1139\\\\n(S.D.N.Y., 1970).  Nor is the lack of financing a defense to a failure to provide minimum\\\\nconstitutional standards.  Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 580 (8th Cir. 1968); Finney v. Arkansas\\\\nBoard of Correction, supra at 199; Gates v. Collier, supra, [501 F.2d 1291,] at 1319, 1320 (5th Cir.\\\\n\\\\n1974); Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, supra, at 669; and Hamilton v. Love, supra, at 1194.  If\\\\nthe State of Oklahoma wishes to hold the inmates in institutions, it must provide the funds to\\\\nmaintain the inmates in a constitutionally permissible manner. \\\\n10.  This Court cannot, on the other hand, allow the Defendants to violate the constitutional rights\\\\nof the Plaintiffs\\\\' class and without acting to alleviate the unconstitutional conditions. \\\\nBased upon the foregoing reasons of unconstitutional confinement of inmates, the Court deems it\\\\nnecessary to enter the following order to alleviate the unconstitutional treatment of inmates. \\\\nORDER AND JUDGMENT\\\\nDefendants are directed to achieve the following goals:\\\\n(a) Commencing in August, 1977, defendants shall reduce the inmate population at Oklahoma\\\\nState Penitentiary, McAlester, Oklahoma, at the rate of 100 inmates that month and a like number\\\\neach succeeding month until the population is reduced to 800 inmates. \\\\n(b) Commencing in August, 1977, defendants shall reduce the inmate population at the Oklahoma\\\\nState Reformatory, Granite, Oklahoma, at the rate of 50 inmates that month and a like number\\\\neach succeeding month until the population is reduced to 450 inmates. \\\\n(c) The Court does not require the abandonment or discontinued use of any confinement facility at\\\\nthis time, but within 15 months from the date hereof\\\\nIn accordance with the trial court\\\\'s instructions issued on May 24, 1977, the State of Oklahoma submitted to the\\\\ncourt a proposed plan, as follows:\\\\nDEFENDANTS\\\\' PROPOSED PLAN\\\\nCome now the defendants above named and in accordance with the Court\\\\'s instructions issued\\\\non May 24, 1977, submit the following proposed plan:\\\\nDefendants, admitting no wrongdoing or violation of any inmate\\\\'s constitutional rights, submit a\\\\nsummary of their ongoing plans to the Court to alter the population concentrations existing within\\\\nthe Oklahoma Department of Corrections.  This plan is entered upon with the intent of insuring that\\\\nno inmate is deprived of his constitutional right.  In addition the plan will increase the security within\\\\nthe institutions and to afford the inmates more opportunity for individualized treatment. \\\\n1.  Within a short time, the Department will open a community treatment center in the Oklahoma\\\\nCity area with a capacity of up to 100;\\\\n2.  At the beginning of 1978, the Department will open a 400 person Assessment and Reception\\\\nCenter at Lexington;\\\\n3.  At the beginning of 1978, the Department will establish two additional community treatment\\\\ncenter with a capacity of up to 100 for each center, enabling more than half of the prisoners\\\\nreleased from the system to undergo several months of work release programming;\\\\n4.

It is undenied that the overcrowded conditions\\\\nwhich were the focus of the May, 1977, hearings amount to cruel and unusual punishment.

Given the history of the case\\\\nand the magnitude of the violations this Court believes that it is improbable that any court would\\\\nconclude that it is arbitrary and capricious to grant immediate relief to the victims who are helpless\\\\nand who are now suffering the cruel and unusual punishment which is now being imposed by the\\\\ndefendants by virtue of the unconstitutional conditions. \\\\nIn their Application the defendants further claim irreparable harm because the Order allegedly\\\\nmandates \\\"transfers, paroles, releases, or restrictions by [state] District Judges against\\\\n398 confinement of convicted felons, without due regard for *398 the safety of the general public and\\\\nthe employees and officers of the institutions of the State of Oklahoma and the health and well-\\\\nbeing of the inmates incarcerated therein.\\\" This is an extravagant and unsupported statement. \\\\nThe Court mandated only the reduction in population levels at the two institutions.  It did not\\\\npurport to dictate or mandate the means by which the defendants can accomplish the established\\\\ngoals.  Similarly, defendants allege \\\"the Court has adopted a posture of administering the\\\\nOklahoma Correctional System in abuse of its constitutional authority and jurisdiction.\\\" The Court\\\\nhas only decreed that the overcrowded conditions in the two particular facilities must be eliminated\\\\nwithin a prescribed time period.  The details and administration of a program are left solely to the\\\\ndiscretion of the defendants.  The Court is interested in ends and not means so long as they are\\\\nlawful.  Defendant further contends that the Order \\\"will unduly disrupt the orderly operation of the\\\\npenal institutions of the State of Oklahoma.\\\" This presumes that the prolongation of the\\\\nunconstitutional conditions is essential to the \\\"orderly operation\\\" of the system.  The Court rejects\\\\nthe idea that constitutionality is incompatible with orderliness and that a constitutional operation is\\\\nby definition disorderly.  Defendants also raise the fear that the Order may result in the premature\\\\nrelease of inmates.  This fear should be abandoned.  The Order specifically provides that no inmate\\\\nshall be prematurely released; that the defendant may apply for a release of the timely schedule of\\\\ndepopulation of the two institutions at any time. \\\\nThe Order itself has a built-in safeguard to permit the defendants to avoid any irreparable injury. \\\\nAll that is required of the defendants is that they undertake in August, 1977, and each succeeding\\\\nmonth thereafter, in good faith, and with due diligence, an attempt to comply with the schedule in\\\\nthe Order.  If they do so, \\\"with all the means and resources available to them,\\\" the Court expects\\\\nand demands no more.  If the threat of irreparable injury becomes real rather than speculative, the\\\\ndefendants may apply to the Court for temporary relief and delay.  By its terms the Order does not\\\\ndecree the impossible and does protect the free majority.  If the defendants will avail themselves, if\\\\nnecessary, of this provision of the Order and make the required showing of impossibility or\\\\n\\\"demonstrably dangerous\\\" threat, defendants can avoid any irreparable harm.  Defendants should\\\\nnot object to being required to demonstrate rather than merely imagine the consequences of\\\\nimplementing the schedule. \\\\nThe third burden which defendants have in order to justify a stay is to show that no substantial\\\\nharm will come to the other interested parties if the stay is granted.  North Central Truck Lines,\\\\nInc., v. United States, 384 F.Supp. 1188 (W.D.Mo.1974), aff\\\\'d., 420 U.S. 901 [95 S.Ct. 820, 42\\\\nL.Ed.2d 832.] The defendants largely ignore this requirement.  The evidence of existing\\\\nenvironmental health and safety problems in the system is overwhelming.  There is no doubt that\\\\nthe overcrowding increases the incident of both infectious communicable diseases (e. g., flu,\\\\nhepatitis, tuberculosis, etc.,) and stress related diseases (e. g., rashes, asthma, hypertension,\\\\netc.).  Defendants offer no assurances that in the do-nothing interim requested by them, that\\\\ninmate fatalities or permanent impairment of the physical and mental health of inmates will not\\\\nresult from these causes.  It is a harsh thing to say that the lives and health of inmates must be\\\\nsacrificed to the administrative convenience of the defendants. \\\\n\\\\nFinally, where does the public interest lie?  This is never an easy question to resolve.  It is\\\\nespecially difficult in this type of case, where the plaintiffs\\\\' class are generally a feared and\\\\ndespised class.  Frequently the issue is confused by the political posturing of public officials.  The\\\\nCourt does not purport to be an oracle, able to foresee the future with a clear vision, but it does\\\\n399 know that in July *399 1973 a public disaster occurred at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\\\nMcAlester.  Lives were lost.  It cost the public many millions of dollars of property destroyed by fire\\\\nand the public is still paying a high price for the actions and neglect of defendants\\\\' predecessors. \\\\nFrom the complex of factors involved, the overriding cause must be ascribed to the inhuman and\\\\nunconstitutional conditions which then prevailed.  This is not to justify the riots, but only to state a\\\\nfact.  Similar conditions now exist.  The public interest obviously would be badly served by a repeat\\\\nof that catastrophe.  The risk of a stay is very great.  If, however, the Order is properly executed the\\\\nrisk is greatly reduced.  The Court has not required or ordered the premature release of any\\\\nprisoner.  The defendants must exercise their expertise and good judgment in the matter of\\\\nprisoner release.  The Court has to believe that in the immediate as well as in the long run the\\\\npublic interest in best served by adherence to the Constitution and the protection of the rights of\\\\nall helpless human beings. \\\\nAs evidenced by the foregoing analysis the defendants have failed to make a strong showing that\\\\nsuccess on the merits of the appeal is likely, that unless a stay is granted irreparable harm will\\\\nresult; that no substantial harm will come to the plaintiffs\\\\' class; that granting of the stay will do no\\\\nharm to the public interest.  Therefore the Application for Stay should be denied. \\\\nThereafter, on July 20, 1977, the State of Oklahoma filed with this court a Motion for Stay, invoking the provisions\\\\nof Rule 8 of the Fed.Rules of Appellate Proc., 28 U.S.C.A. That Motion was granted and has been subsequently\\\\nextended and continued to date.  The contentions raised in relation thereto are considered by this court as part\\\\nand parcel of the issues on the merits to be decided on appeal.  In the Motion for Stay the State of Oklahoma\\\\nalleges, inter alia, that (a) the subject order requires the transfer of inmates to less secure institutions within the\\\\nsystem, (b) the State of Oklahoma has previously presented the trial court with a plan for accomplishing the\\\\norderly reduction in inmate population at certain institutions, increasing the capacity at other institutions as well as\\\\npurchasing and constructing new facilities, (c) the aforesaid plan or program has been funded and approved by\\\\nthe Governor and the State Legislature of the State of Oklahoma and mutually agreed to by all of the parties, and\\\\n(d) that if this court fails to stay the Order, the State of Oklahoma must choose between two unacceptable\\\\nactions: first, order inmates transferred to other institutions which have less security, or operating with greater\\\\npopulations than are desirable, place violent and passive inmates in close association, reduce supervision,\\\\nincrease the likelihood of escape and subject the citizens of Oklahoma to increased danger, or, second, to follow\\\\nall the recognized practices of accepted penology, protect the lives and rights of employees, inmates and\\\\ncitizens, but to incur the legal contempt of the court. Finally, the State of Oklahoma points out that the movement\\\\nof inmates necessitates staff transfers, budgetary changes, construction of additional facilities, contracts and\\\\nbidding procedures which must follow state laws, and numerous other administrative problems which require\\\\nseveral months of advanced planning to accomplish, which has, in fact, been considered and incorporated into\\\\nthe State\\\\'s plan for new institutions, as well as the reduction of inmate population at the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary and the Oklahoma State Reformatory.  The State of Oklahoma complains that Battle, et al., and the\\\\nUnited States, as intervenor, presented \\\"absolutely no evidence concerning medical problems, increased\\\\nviolence level, brutality, use of trustee guards, inadequate food and clothing or an excessive amount of time\\\\nspent in cells\\\" while acknowledging that \\\"the testimony concerning these critical areas was solicited on cross-\\\\nexamination from the defendants, Director Benton and Warden Crisp.\\\" [Brief of Defendants-Appellants, p. 10.] 400 Such does not support the contention that the trial court was without *400 substantial evidence to support its\\\\nfindings.  The record indicates otherwise.  Nor are we impressed with the State of Oklahoma\\\\'s contention that the\\\\nTrial Court denied it a fair hearing or that the court was \\\"misled and unduly swayed\\\" by its consideration of\\\\nalleged inadmissible exhibits and unsubstantiated facts.  As to the \\\"fair hearing\\\" contention, the record establishes\\\\nthat even though proper notice was submitted by the court, the State of Oklahoma did not request a pre-trial\\\\nconference or any request of the court to obtain a list of witnesses or other matters.  [R., Vol. I, pp. 8-11.] While\\\\nthe entire record does indeed reflect that certain hearsay and/or questionable exhibits (from an evidentiary point\\\\nof view) were presented, there is nothing indicating that they \\\"misled or unduly swayed\\\" the Trial Court or even\\\\n\\\\nthat the Trial Court in fact relied upon them.  We observe that even though the \\\"foundation\\\" challenges to certain\\\\nexhibits are not without substance, there is no doubt from the record that most of them were in fact documents\\\\nprepared by agencies and/or departments of the State of Oklahoma.  [For example, see Vol. I, pp. 254-265.] We are satisfied that the State of Oklahoma has, since the 1973 disastrous riot, made significant progress in\\\\nupgrading its penal system.  The State contends that the 1974 Oklahoma Legislature appropriated\\\\n$16,285,090.00 to the penal system, representing an increase of 46.9% over the previous year; that the 1976\\\\nLegislature appropriated $44,000,000.00, an increase of 534% over the 1973 appropriation.  There can be no\\\\ndoubt that the State of Oklahoma has, as the District Court acknowledged, made significant strides and efforts to\\\\nremedy the serious deficiencies.  Even so, the Court\\\\'s finding that the presently existing overcrowding condition at\\\\nthe two facilities, when considered with other circumstances, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is not\\\\nclearly erroneous.  We hold that there is substantial evidence supporting the finding.  It was made, to be sure,\\\\nnotwithstanding the comprehensive Plan prepared and submitted to the Court by the State of Oklahoma and\\\\napproved by all parties to this litigation.  That Plan established a priority goal by the State in the commitment of its\\\\nfiscal and administrative resources to expeditiously upgrade its entire penal-correctional system.  We commend\\\\nthe State of Oklahoma and its people for the actions taken.  Even so, we must hold that the Trial Court did not err\\\\nin its order here challenged.  We cannot, on the basis of the record before us, arbitrarily substitute our judgment\\\\nfor that of the resident federal district judge who has given so much of his time, conscience and effort to this on-\\\\ngoing case. His concern for the protection of the constitutional rights of the inmates goes to the \\\"heart\\\" of their\\\\nphysical and mental well being.  We believe that the Trial Court has endeavored to diligently accommodate the\\\\nconcurrent problems confronting the State of Oklahoma.  We agree with the District Court that the exigencies\\\\nweigh in favor of the inmates. \\\\nWe have carefully considered the State of Oklahoma\\\\'s request for the additional time required to effectuate its\\\\ncomprehensive Plan which the State deems necessary in order to fashion a solid basis for future planning and\\\\nadministration of the state\\\\'s penal system.  In relation to the Stay Order, the State of Oklahoma alleges that the\\\\nTrial Court has mandated an arbitrary reduction of the inmate population with fixed schedules in the face of a\\\\nreasonable and feasible State plan already adopted and designed to remove the conditions complained of which\\\\nhas met with the consent of all of the parties.  The State of Oklahoma does not challenge or dispute the fact of\\\\novercrowding at the two penal facilities affected by the reduction order, but it does emphatically argue that those\\\\nconditions are not such as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by the Eighth Amendment. \\\\nDuring oral argument, counsel for the State of Oklahoma emphasized that the record simply does not support the\\\\nTrial Court\\\\'s findings that the inmates at the two affected facilities are being subjected to cruel and unusual\\\\npunishment.  On the contrary, it was contended that they are not in anywise ill treated. \\\\n401 *401 Bobby Battle, et al. (the inmate class), by and through the American Civil Liberties Union, have resisted the\\\\nMotion for Stay, pointing to the uncontroverted facts of overcrowding and the intolerable conditions of\\\\nconfinement found by the Trial Court to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Battle contends that the facts\\\\nfound are not denied by the State of Oklahoma and that the \\\"defendants totally ignore the danger which these\\\\npractices [overcrowding in cells, inadequate ventilation, fire protection and sanitation] place the inmate population\\\\nin.\\\" Battle argues that the Trial Court\\\\'s order was issued after careful, deliberate proceedings and consideration,\\\\non the basis of overwhelming evidence of unconstitutional prison conditions.  Further, Battle alleges that the State\\\\nof Oklahoma is not entitled to a stay simply because it must go to some extra effort in order to comply.  Battle\\\\nargues that the State fails on each of the four factors this Court must consider in granting the requested stay: (1)\\\\nwhether the State has made a strong showing that it is likely to prevail on the merits of the appeal, (2) whether\\\\nthe State has shown irreparable injury if the stay is not granted, (3) whether a stay will substantially harm the\\\\nother parties to the litigation, and (4) where the public interest lies.  Battle contends that the State of Oklahoma\\\\nhas virtually ignored these requirements. \\\\nThe United States of America, as Plaintiff Intervenor, by and through the Attorney General, Department of Justice,\\\\nhas moved to deny State\\\\'s Motion for Stay, alleging, inter alia, that the State of Oklahoma has not specifically\\\\naddressed itself to the four (4) elements of the criteria above referred to in determining the propriety of a stay\\\\norder pending compliance with the Plan.  Furthermore, the United States argues that even had the State done so,\\\\nit could not have prevailed in the face of the continuation of physical conditions and practices at the two\\\\ninstitutions which the District Court found to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in relation to the inmate\\\\n\\\\npopulation.  The United States urges that the stay be denied in that the continuation of the intolerable conditions\\\\nwill require inmates to suffer substantial harm by being forced to live in less than 20 square feet and to be housed\\\\nin facilities which are unfit for human habitation.  Further, the United States argues that the State\\\\'s Plan,\\\\nconsented to by the parties, was not submitted at or during any of the three hearings dealing with the issue of\\\\novercrowding and that, in fact, the Plan was not written until after the trial court\\\\'s May 24, 1977, bench ruling and\\\\nwas not presented to the parties until June 13, 1977.  The record confirms this contention.  The United States also\\\\nalleges that the inmate reduction order was orally communicated by the Court on May 24, 1977 and that the\\\\nparties were directed to confer upon the timetable, knowing that the Court was considering a range of 90 to 180\\\\ndays.  Again, the record bears this out.  [R., Vol. I, p. 282.] However, the United States does agree that the parties\\\\ndid present to the Court a draft order which contained the Plan\\\\'s recommended construction timetable, but which\\\\ndid not deal with either the numerical or time limitations ordered by the Trial Court from the bench.  Accordingly,\\\\nthe United States contends that the Trial Court\\\\'s order requiring a reduction of inmate population on a timetable\\\\nbasis is clearly within the equitable power of the Court and a matter directly addressed by the Court at the\\\\nconclusion of the May 24, 1977 hearing. \\\\nDISPOSITION\\\\nWe hold that the challenged Order of the District Court is supported by substantial evidence.  We direct that the\\\\nStay Order Pending Appeal entered by this Court as thereafter extended and continued, be and the same is\\\\nhereby vacated. \\\\nWe hold that the Trial Court\\\\'s finding that the overcrowding inmate population at the two subject Oklahoma\\\\ninstitutions constitutes cruel and unusual punishment proscribed under the Eighth Amendment to the United\\\\nStates Constitution, is supported by substantial evidence.  See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50\\\\n402 L.Ed.2d 251,supra.  In that case the Court held that a state prisoner\\\\'s civil rights complaint *402 lodged under 42\\\\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment for inadequate treatment of a back\\\\ninjury while engaged in work in the Texas penitentiary must be entertained, and that deliberate indifference by\\\\nprison personnel to a prisoner\\\\'s serious injury or illness constitutes cruel and unusual punishment contravening\\\\nthe Eighth Amendment.  The court there reviewed the history of the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual\\\\npunishment.  It noted that the primary concern of the constitutional drafters was to proscribe \\\"tortures\\\" and other\\\\n\\\"barbarous\\\" methods of punishment.  The court then related:\\\\nOur more recent cases, however, have held that the Amendment proscribes more than physically\\\\nbarbarous punishments.  See, e. g., Gregg v. Georgia, supra [428 U.S. 153] at 171, [96 S.Ct. 2909\\\\nat 2924] (plurality opinion); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-101, [78 S.Ct. 590, 597, 598, 2\\\\nL.Ed.2d 630] (1958); Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 373 [30 S.Ct. 544, 551, 54 L.Ed.\\\\n793] (1910).

Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 579 (C.A. 8 1968),\\\\nagainst which we must evaluate penal measures.  Thus, we have held repugnant to the Eighth\\\\nAmendment punishments which are incompatible with \\\"the evolving standards of decency that\\\\nmark the progress of a maturing society.\\\" Trop v. Dulles, supra, [356 U.S.] at 101, [78 S.Ct. 590 at\\\\n598]; see also Gregg v. Georgia, supra, [428 U.S. 153] at 153, [96 S.Ct. 2909] (plurality opinion); \\\\nWeems v.

Utah, supra, [996 U.S. 130] at 136, [25\\\\nL.Ed. 345]. \\\\nThese elementary principles establish the government\\\\'s obligation to provide medical care for\\\\nthose whom it is punishing by incarceration.  An inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his\\\\nmedical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met. In the worst cases, such\\\\na failure may actually produce physical \\\"torture or a lingering death,\\\" In re Kemmler [136 U.S. 436,\\\\n10 S.Ct. 930, 34 L.Ed. 519,] supra, the evils of most immediate concern to the drafters of the\\\\nAmendment.  In less serious cases, denial of medical care may result in pain and suffering which\\\\n\\\\nno one suggests would serve any penological purpose.  Cf. Gregg v. Georgia, supra, [428 U.S.\\\\n153] at 171-74, [96 S.Ct. 2909 at 2924-25] (plurality opinion).  The infliction of such unnecessary\\\\nsuffering is inconsistent with contemporary standards of decency as manifested in modern\\\\nlegislation codifying the commonlaw view that \\\"[i]t is but just that the public be required to care for\\\\nthe prisoner, who cannot, by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, care for himself.\\\" In Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) the Supreme Court stated, inter alia:\\\\nOf course, the requirements of the Eighth Amendment must be applied with an awareness of the\\\\nlimited role to be played by the courts.  This does not mean that judges have no role to play, for the\\\\nEighth Amendment is a restraint upon the exercise of legislative power. \\\\n\\\"Judicial review, by definition, often involves a conflict between judicial and legislative judgment as\\\\nto what the Constitution means or requires.  In this respect, Eighth Amendment cases come to us\\\\nin no different posture.  It seems conceded by all that the Amendment imposes some obligation on\\\\nthe judiciary to judge the constitutionality of punishment and that there are punishments that the\\\\nAmendment would bar whether legislatively approved or not.\\\" Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. [238]\\\\nat 313-314, [92 S.Ct. 2706, 2825, 33 L.Ed.2d 346] (White, J. concurring.) 428 U.S. at p. 174, 96 S.Ct., at p. 2925. \\\\n403 *403 It is the obligation of the federal courts to be ever alert not to intrude into the affairs of state prison\\\\nadministration unless there is displayed a clear failure by the State to take cognizance of an inmate\\\\'s valid federal\\\\nconstitutional rights.  We are satisfied that in the instant case neither this court nor the District Court has interfered\\\\nwith matters in the sole discretion of state officials.  We believe that while an inmate does not have a federal\\\\nconstitutional right to rehabilitation, he is entitled to be confined in an environment which does not result in his\\\\ndegeneration or which threatens his mental and physical well being. \\\\nThe State of Oklahoma argues that if this Court affirms the Trial Court\\\\'s order and if the inmates are transferred to\\\\nother institutions \\\"which have less security, or operating with greater populations than are desirable\\\" that such\\\\naction will place violent and passive inmates in close association, reduce supervision, increase the likelihood of\\\\nescape and subject the people of Oklahoma to increased danger.  We would wish such risks away if wishing\\\\nserved the purpose.  We agree with the Trial Court finding, that while the State of Oklahoma has made significant\\\\nprogress in correcting many of the abuses and/or providing for new or additional facilities, personnel and\\\\nprograms within its penal system, still the State has not prevented the degenerated overcrowding conditions\\\\nwhich have come to pass at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester and at the Oklahoma State\\\\nReformatory at Granite.  The transfer of the inmates as ordered by the Trial Court is, of course, subject to change\\\\nor modification if the District Court deems such action necessary and proper in the future.  Viewing the facts and\\\\ncircumstances contained in the record in their totality, we hold that the Order here challenged must be affirmed. \\\\nWhile neither this Court nor the District Court holds to the proposition that prisoners subjected to the punishment\\\\nof incarceration are entitled to the rights and privileges of one who has not committed a crime against person or\\\\nproperty crying out for retribution, still the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment cannot be countenanced in\\\\nan orderly society.  While the rights and privileges necessarily lost 00 and, in effect, surrendered 00 by prisoners in\\\\n97 97\\\\npunishment for crimes committed are many and varied, they cannot be denied all rights and privileges.

The\\\\ncomplaint seeks injunctive relief, on behalf of all members of the plaintiff class, to remedy the alleged misconduct\\\\nof the defendants as well as monetary damages for plaintiff Battle. \\\\nNamed as defendants were Leo McCracken, Director of Corrections, Park J. Anderson, Warden, and Sam C.\\\\nJohnston, Deputy Warden of the State Penitentiary at McAlester.  Since the commencement of this action, Leo\\\\nMcCracken has been replaced by John Grider, who now serves as Acting Director of Corrections, and Park J.\\\\nAnderson has been replaced by Sam C. Johnston, who now serves as Acting Warden of the State Penitentiary at\\\\nMcAlester, and Mr. Pete Douglas has replaced Sam C. Johnston as Acting Deputy Warden.  Mr. Roy Sprinkle,\\\\nDeputy Director of Corrections in charge of Institutions, Captain Black, Danny Nace and Otis Campbell,\\\\nCorrectional Officers at the State Penitentiary, have been added as defendants. \\\\nOn March 15, 1973, the late Judge Edwin Langley granted the United States\\\\' Motion to Intervene pursuant to\\\\nTitle IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000h-2.  The complaint in intervention alleged segregation by\\\\nrace in housing assignments and certain other aspects of penitentiary operations. \\\\n\\\\nOn March 5, 1974, the Court granted the United States\\\\' motion to amend its complaint in intervention which now\\\\nalleges, in addition to the allegations of the original complaint in intervention, that the defendants have\\\\ndiscriminated against black inmates in making job assignments and in the operation of the penitentiary\\\\ndisciplinary system; and that they have, with regard to all inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, without\\\\nregard to race, subjected them to disciplinary procedures and taken disciplinary action against them without\\\\nproviding due process of law; subjected those inmates in disciplinary segregation to cruel and unusual\\\\n408 punishment by depriving them of food, clothing, bedding, light and necessary *408 personal hygiene items;\\\\nplaced inmates in non-disciplinary administrative segregation without providing them with due process of law and\\\\nsubjected them to unreasonable conditions of confinement; inflicted upon inmates summary punishment without\\\\ndue process of law and cruel and unusual punishment by the use of chemical agents, including mace and tear\\\\ngas; inflicted upon inmates cruel and unusual punishment by maintaining and operating a medical care delivery\\\\nsystem that is incapable of providing and has failed to provide adequate medical care; imposed upon inmates\\\\narbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on mailing privileges, including censorship and rejection of mail to and\\\\nfrom attorneys, courts, government officials, family members and religious ministers; refused inmates the right to\\\\nsubscribe to or receive personal legal reference materials, as well as certain other periodicals; and denied\\\\ninmates adequate access to the courts by failing to provide an adequate law library or any reasonable and\\\\nadequate alternative thereto and by specifically refusing to permit inmates to have in their possession any\\\\npersonal legal reference materials or to assist each other on legal problems. \\\\nThe parties have conducted extensive pretrial discovery consisting of depositions, inspections and investigations\\\\nconducted by attorneys, FBI agents and experts in penology. \\\\nAt the final pretrial conference held on March 4, 1974, counsel orally stipulated and agreed and the court ordered\\\\nthat all depositions taken prior to trial be admitted into evidence and made a part of the record. \\\\nTrial on the merits was heard at McAlester, Oklahoma, on March 14 and 15, 1974.  At the outset, counsel for all\\\\nparties stipulated and agreed to the authenticity of copies of documents marked exhibits 1 through 161 and\\\\ncontained in 18 bound volumes previously tendered to counsel and the court by the United States.  It was further\\\\nstipulated and agreed and the court ordered that the said exhibits be admitted into evidence and made a part of\\\\nthe record in this case.\\\\nUpon the basis of the depositions and exhibits and the oral testimony heard at the trial of this case and the cases\\\\nof Holland et al. v. Anderson (No. 73-324) heard on March 12, 1974, and the consolidated cases of Barnett et al.\\\\nv. Hall (No. 73-237), Johnson v. Anderson (No. 74-8), Barnett et al. v. Pontesso (No. 70-97) and Johnson et al. v.\\\\nAnderson (No. 72-90) heard on March 13, 1974, the court makes its findings of fact and conclusions of law as\\\\nfollows:\\\\nFindings of Fact\\\\n1.  The Oklahoma State Penitentiary system consists of a main maximum security facility at McAlester and\\\\nseveral subsidiary institutions located at McAlester and other locations throughout the southeastern and western\\\\nportion of Oklahoma.  These subsidiaries include a dual unit women\\\\'s ward and a male trusty unit which are also\\\\nlocated at McAlester; a medium security vocational training school located at Stringtown, Oklahoma, about 40\\\\nmiles south of McAlester; a smaller minimum security facility for vocational training located near Hodgens,\\\\nOklahoma; and an Honor farm near Farris, Oklahoma. \\\\n2.

Title\\\\n57 O.S.A. \\u00a7 521. \\\\n5.  Between January, 1970 and July 27, 1973, the total population in the penitentiary system averaged about\\\\n2,990 male and 120 female inmates.  The largest concentration of inmates in the system was \\\"behind the walls\\\" at\\\\nthe main facility at McAlester. \\\\n6.  On July 27, 1973, a riot occurred at the McAlester facility which resulted in the destruction of some physical\\\\nfacilities and damage to others.  Following the riot, many programs, procedures, practices and operations that had\\\\nbeen in effect at the penitentiary were either eliminated or curtailed.  The general inmate population was placed\\\\non a twenty-four-hour lockdown which continued with only minor modifications at the time of the trial in this case.\\\\nNumerous examples could be cited from the record of practices and conditions which were justified as\\\\nemergency measures in the immediate aftermath of the riot and even for some time thereafter, but which were\\\\nstill in substantial effect at the time of the trial of this case, long after their justification had ended. \\\\n7.  During the 7 months of 1973 prior to the riot, the inmate population at the main facility averaged about 1778 or\\\\n57% of the total penitentiary population.  The racial composition of the population at the main facility averaged\\\\n29.5% Black and 70.5% non-Black inmates.  Many of these inmates were transferred to subsidiary institutions and\\\\nto municipal and county holding facilities and commitments to McAlester were suspended following the riot.  The\\\\npopulation at McAlester dropped to 1338 in August 1973, and after several additional reductions has leveled off\\\\nat approximately 900 inmates since the first of this year. \\\\n8.  Prior to the riot, the facilities at the main penitentiary consisted of an administration building, four general\\\\npopulation cellhouses and a mess hall radiating from a central rotunda, a maximum security unit and combination\\\\nhospital-gymnasium and a series of industrial and maintenance buildings, some of which were located in the\\\\n\\\"industrial area\\\" north of the main walls.  Two of the general population cellhouses were constructed in 1907.  The\\\\nthird and fourth units were added in 1932 and 1935.  The design capacity of the penitentiary was approximately\\\\n1,200. \\\\n9.  The civilian staff level of about 350 at the main McAlester facility has remained fairly constant.  Out of this total\\\\ncivilian staff, about 242 have been employed as security personnel holding the rank of Correctional Officer I\\\\n410 (about 160 men); Correctional Officer *410 II (about 65 men); Correctional Officer III or Lieutenant (about 11\\\\nmen); and Correctional Officer IV or Captain (about 6 men).  Under the normal conditions as they existed before\\\\nthe riot, the security staff provided 24 hour, 7 day a week supervision and surveillance over the cellhouses,\\\\nlockup areas, guard towers and hospital complex.  The staff also provided daytime supervision and surveillance\\\\nover the work areas (industrial, maintenance and administrative), the yard and special inmate work gangs.  They\\\\nalso supplied the supervision required for the transfer of inmates to other Oklahoma penal facilities, to outside\\\\nmedical facilities and to the courts.  Their post-riot activities have generally consisted of carrying out such security\\\\nfunctions as were deemed necessary, from time to time, by penitentiary authorities. \\\\n\\\\n10.  The security force at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester is understaffed and spread far too thin. \\\\nThe continuing deficiencies in needed personnel have been at least 30 to 35 percent less than the level required\\\\nto maintain adequate supervision and control.  This limited staff is inadequately trained and poorly supervised. \\\\nThere is a high turnover among correctional officers; the monthly rate reaching 8 to 9 percent, particularly among\\\\nlower echelon security personnel.  Proper training may well be impossible with this shortage of personnel\\\\naccompanied by such a continuing turnover rate. \\\\nThe available security force is simply inadequate to maintain proper order and carry on even minimally effective\\\\ncorrections operations.  Staffing deficiencies have been a causative factor in the conditions which existed and still\\\\nexist at the penitentiary.  The level of violence inside the penitentiary has been alarming.  From January 1970 until\\\\nJuly 27, 1973, defendants\\\\' own records reflect a total of 19 violent deaths.  In addition, there were 40 stabbings\\\\nand 44 serious beatings of inmates.  Some of the violence occurred in the cellhouses where frequently only one\\\\nguard was available for an entire cellhouse.  Some violence occurred on the prison yard where frequently only\\\\none or two guards were available to supervise and control the entire general population. \\\\n11.  Since the riot, lack of adequate security has been used continously as an excuse for the confinement of the\\\\nmajority of inmates in their cells 24 hours a day, in complete idleness and without any form of exercise or other\\\\nrecreation.  As previously indicated, this massive and almost total lockdown has continued for over 8 months, with\\\\nthe limited exception that inmates not confined in disciplinary maximum security have recently been granted the\\\\nmeager privilege of eating one or two meals in the mess hall every other day provided adequate security is\\\\navailable.  Only a limited number of inmates are regularly permitted out of their cells to perform penitentiary\\\\nmaintenance and housekeeping chores such as preparing food and repairing or maintaining the physical\\\\ncomplex. \\\\nRacial Discrimination and Segregation\\\\n12.  Prior to the July riot, the policy and practice at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary was to maintain a prison\\\\nsystem segregated by race and by means of which black inmates were subjected to discriminatory and unequal\\\\ntreatment.  Except for the maximum security unit, where inmates under disciplinary punishment were confined in\\\\nsingle cells, all inmates were routinely assigned to housing units on the basis of race.  The reception center, the\\\\nmess hall, the recreation yard and barber facilities were racially segregated.  Black inmates were discriminated\\\\nagainst in job assignments and were subjected to more frequent and disparate punishment than white inmates. \\\\nThe guard force was and remains predominantly white.  A policy statement issued by the Department of\\\\nCorrections on October 20, 1972, declared the official departmental policy to be that all of its correctional facilities\\\\nwould be integrated in order to insure equal rights and equal opportunity to all persons confined therein.  This\\\\n411 policy *411 statement also directed correctional administrators to formulate, implement and follow up procedures\\\\nto insure that discrimination did not occur in practice.  The need to increase minority personnel at every level was\\\\nmade clear and it was suggested that each correctional facility appoint an official to be directly responsible for\\\\nsupervising the recruitment and fair treatment of minority employees.  A departmental operations memorandum\\\\nissued on the same date set forth specific requirements for the implementation of the departmental policy\\\\nstatement.  Wardens at each state penal facility were directed to prepare plans for complete integration, to take\\\\nimmediate action to inform and instruct all employees regarding the official policy on racial segregation and of\\\\ntheir obligations thereunder, to implement an objective and fair classification system for inmates with respect to\\\\nall aspects of institutional life, to inform the inmates of the racial segregation policy, and to make telephonic\\\\nprogress reports each Monday morning to the Deputy Director of Institutions or the Director of the Department of\\\\nCorrections detailing the percentages of integration at each location and any major problems encountered.  Both\\\\nthe policy statement and accompanying operations memorandum were completely ignored by the Warden at the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester.  Racial segregation, as had been practiced prior to the issuance of\\\\nthese directives, continued unabated.  Not until the July riot did any noticeable changes occur.  Only at that time,\\\\noperating under emergency conditions, were inmates randomly lined up and ordered into cells.  At the present\\\\ntime the housing units are not racially segregated.  Due to perceived emergency conditions the prison population\\\\nis temporarily confined to single cells under 24 hour lockdown.  The defendants have instituted a security\\\\nclassification system under which inmates are assigned either a medium, maximum, or close custody grade and\\\\n\\\\nseparated into various housing units according to their respective classifications.  The new grading system does\\\\nnot, however, provide for specific cell assignments and transfers on a non-racial basis.  Accordingly, there is no\\\\npresent assurance that housing units will not become resegregated when normal operations are restored. \\\\nDisciplinary Rules, Punishment and Procedure\\\\n13.  Prior to the July 27, 1973, riot, defendants administered a disciplinary program which could result in punitive\\\\nsanctions including punitive segregation as well as loss of incentive time and other privileges.  These sanctions\\\\nwere imposed pursuant to a disciplinary process which is described in departmental policy statements and in the\\\\nmost recent inmate manual.  Viewing the disciplinary process as a whole, to include both policies and practices,\\\\ndefendants have failed to afford inmates the procedural safeguards which are minimally necessary to insure\\\\nfundamental fairness.  The record discloses the following:\\\\n(a) Inmates are not fairly adequately apprised of the conduct which can lead to disciplinary action. \\\\nSome, but not all, punishable conduct is contained in various rule books and manuals.  There is,\\\\nhowever, no policy limiting punishment to listed infractions; some infractions are specified in\\\\nemployee manuals, but excluded from inmate rule books; some of the most common, minor\\\\ninfractions are nowhere listed or defined although punishment routinely results in the event of\\\\nviolations.  In some instances, inmates have been punished for violating unwritten rules against\\\\nconstitutionally protected activity (e. g., assisting or being assisted by one another in legal matters\\\\nin the absence of reasonable alternatives). \\\\n(b) In the event that disciplinary charges are filed, the applicable Department of Corrections policy\\\\nstatement provides for pre-hearing detention in \\\"serious cases\\\" only.  It was formerly the official\\\\n412 O.S.P. practice *412 to segregate only those charged with \\\"major\\\" offenses, as described in the\\\\nemployee manual.  This practice was later changed by O.S.P. officials, and, thereafter, all inmates\\\\ncharged with any rule infraction(s) were automatically confined in segregation, prior to a hearing,\\\\nin the punishment work gang lockup area located in New Cellhouse or the new jail in the West\\\\nCellhouse.  Because the Disciplinary Committee usually met only once a week, inmates could\\\\nroutinely be held in segregation for up to six days without a hearing, regardless of the seriousness\\\\nof the offense charged.  Inmates have in fact been so held for up to six weeks before receiving\\\\ntheir hearings. \\\\n(c) The Department of Corrections has published rules governing the procedures to be followed at\\\\ndisciplinary hearings.  They do not require, however, that the disciplinary committee be comprised\\\\nof disinterested persons.  In practice, hearings have been and are held on occasion before\\\\ncommittees with a member or members who have either brought the charges against the inmate\\\\nor otherwise participated in the preparation or processing thereof. \\\\n(d) The official policy is to afford inmates a prehearing interview and an opportunity to appear and\\\\nbe heard at the hearing itself.  Inmates are, however, denied the right to call witnesses on their\\\\nown behalf or to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.  No representation is provided by\\\\nthe institution and outside assistance from counsel or any other source is prohibited. \\\\n(e) There are no departmental rules, criteria or standards governing the type or duration of\\\\npunishment which the disciplinary committee may impose for any given infraction.  It has been the\\\\npolicy and practice at the penitentiary to impose indefinite sentences to the various lockup\\\\nfacilities.  As a result of this practice, inmates have in fact often been held on punitive segregation\\\\nfor prolonged terms (which frequently reached six months to a year) under extremely harsh\\\\nrestraints and conditions. \\\\n(f) It is the written policy of the Department of Corrections to afford a weekly review of all persons\\\\non lockup by the Deputy Warden or his designee.  The Standard to be applied and the procedures\\\\nto be followed during these review sessions are not, however, set forth.  In practice, there is no\\\\nmeaningful independent review by the Deputy Warden or other high-ranking, responsible\\\\n\\\\nadministrative officer or panel.  Instead, the responsibility for determining length of confinement\\\\nhas been abdicated to the correctional officers in charge of the individual lockups. \\\\n(g) The officer in charge of the Maximum Security Unit has been permitted to punish inmates\\\\nsummarily, without a hearing or any other procedural safeguards for conduct which takes place in\\\\nthe unit.  Accordingly, inmates have had the minimal privileges afforded on M.S.U.  further reduced\\\\nfor conduct deemed objectionable by the officers in charge.  Similarly, inmates may be transferred\\\\nto one of several isolation cells on M.S. U. at the sole discretion of the officer in charge, without\\\\nany procedural safeguards other than the informal requirement that the Deputy Warden or chief of\\\\nSecurity be notified. \\\\n14.  Inmates confined in disciplinary lockup, particularly in the Maximum Security Unit, have been held for\\\\nprolonged periods in close confinement.  Exercise was limited to 15 minutes twice a week prior to the riot.  Since\\\\nthat time all exercise was being denied as recently as the date of this trial. Sleeping accommodations consist of\\\\nmattresses placed directly on the floor or on a concrete slab.  There were and are no beds.  The cells are vermin\\\\ninfested.  Lighting throughout the lockup areas was and is inadequate. \\\\n413 The isolation cells have the same dimensions and fixtures as other M.S.U.  *413 cells.  They are, however, sealed\\\\noff from the rest of the unit by a dividing wall. These isolation cells have only a small window or \\\"bean hole\\\" which\\\\ncan be closed to isolate the occupant completely and to seal out all light and ventilation.  Such inmates receive no\\\\nexercise, reading material or any other form of recreation. \\\\nInmates who were sentenced to that form of disciplinary status officially referred to as \\\"72 hour detention,\\\" were\\\\ndeprived of food, clothing, bedding and necessary hygienic materials and confined in cells generally known and\\\\ncommonly referred to as \\\"hole\\\" cells.  These are totally dark and stripped of all fixtures other than latrines and\\\\nfaucets.  Penitentiary officials published rules for such \\\"72 hour detention,\\\" but there were no published\\\\ndepartmental policies governing the use of these \\\"hole\\\" cells.  Confinement in these \\\"hole\\\" cells was discontinued\\\\nin the fall of 1972, pursuant to an unwritten administrative directive.  The actual cells have been maintained and\\\\nremain available in substantially the same condition as before for future use at any time this or any subsequent\\\\nadministration so decides. \\\\nAdministrative Lockup\\\\n15.  Prior to the riot, a large number of inmates were confined in administrative segregation on the top floor of the\\\\nwest cell house and on the top floor of the new cell house.  Although some inmates were held in the administrative\\\\nsegregation areas for disciplinary punishment due to a lack of space in the maximum security unit, the majority\\\\nwere so held for a variety of reasons such as protection from other inmates, observation, investigation, awaiting\\\\ncourt action and pre-hearing detention.  These inmates had been convicted of no infractions or offenses and had\\\\nbeen provided no hearings or other procedural safeguards.  In spite of this, they were subjected to conditions of\\\\nconfinement which were punitive in nature.  They were held in close confinement for prolonged periods with\\\\nminimal lighting and ventilation.  They received no exercise.  Their privileges were restricted and they were denied\\\\nthe oportunity to participate in the prison work programs, to earn work time or to engage in any self-improvement\\\\nprograms.  They were not considered for trusty status or parole eligibility.  Following the riot, administrative\\\\nsegregation as previously practiced was dispensed with.  Instead, through the process of custody grading and the\\\\n24 hour lockdown, essentially the entire prison population is now confined in administrative segregation under\\\\nconditions which can still only be described as punitive.  Inmates classified as \\\"maximum custody,\\\" are not\\\\nconfined in the maximum security unit, and the first floor of East Cellhouse although they have been provided no\\\\ndisciplinary hearings.  Inmates classified as \\\"close custody\\\" are now confined on the second and third floors of\\\\nEast Cellhouse.  Inmates classified \\\"medium custody\\\" are confined on the fourth floor of East Cellhouse and\\\\nthroughout the West Cellhouse.  A limited number of medium security inmates who have work assignments are\\\\nalso housed on the first floor of New Cellhouse.  Inmates with different custody grades received different\\\\ntreatment.  Those maximum custody inmates assigned to the maximum security unit receive the fewest privileges. \\\\nAt the other extreme are the medium custody inmates who have been afforded work privileges. \\\\n\\\\nUse of Chemical Agents\\\\n16.  The use of chemical mace and tear gas normally causes physical pain and discomfort and, on several\\\\noccasions appearing in this record, the use of such chemical agents has caused serious physical injury and even\\\\ndeath of inmates.  Pursuant to his statutory authority, the Director of the Department of Corrections issued Policy\\\\nStatement No. 7302.1 dated January 4, 1973, regarding the use of force including chemical agents at all\\\\n414 Oklahoma Correctional Facilities.  Under this policy, only such force was to be *414 employed as was reasonably\\\\nnecessary under all attendant circumstances.  Definite guidelines for implementing the policy included the\\\\nfollowing:\\\\n(a) No person was to lay hands on a prisoner, except in self defense, to prevent an escape, to\\\\nprevent injury to persons or damage to property, or to quell a disturbance.  In controlling or moving\\\\nan unruly prisoner, sufficient personnel were to be used to preclude the necessity for striking or\\\\ninflicting bodily injury.  Gas was not to be used on an individual prisoner except to prevent serious\\\\ninjury or loss of life. Accordingly, physical force was not to be used to force compliance with rules\\\\nor regulations other than under the foregoing circumstances. \\\\n(b) When the use of force was necessary, it was to be exercised according to the priorities of force\\\\nand limited to the minimum degree necessary under the particular circumstances.  When firepower\\\\nwas utilized, the aim would be to disable rather than to kill.  The application of any or all of the\\\\npriorities of force listed below, or the application of a higher numbered priority without first\\\\nemploying a lowered numbered one, was dependent upon and required to be consistent with the\\\\nsituation encountered during any particular disorder.  Priorities of force were:\\\\n1) Physical restraint;\\\\n2) Show of force;\\\\n3) Use of physical force other than weapons fire (Riot Squads);\\\\n4) Use of high pressure water;\\\\n5) Use of chemical agents;\\\\n6) Fire by selected marksmen;\\\\n7) Use of full fire power. \\\\nThe policy statement required that whenever a chemical agent was used on an inmate and/or\\\\ninmates, the Warden would immediately telephone the Director of the Department of Corrections\\\\nor, in his absence, the Deputy Director of Institutions.  The telephonic report was to be followed by\\\\na written report containing all facts and circumstances concerning the incident. \\\\nNotwithstanding these directives, the wardens and other high-level officials at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\\\nMcAlester have approved or acquiesced in the use of chemical agents as a purely punitive measure against\\\\ninmates, including even inmates locked in their cells, in violation of the limitations imposed by the Department of\\\\nCorrections.  Mace and tear gas have been used on inmates for such conduct as loud singing in cells, refusing to\\\\nget haircuts or to shave, possession of contraband (such as instant coffee) in cells, destruction of state property\\\\n(such as breaking plastic spoons), cursing an officer, talking in a loud voice or yelling, screaming for a doctor and\\\\nshaking or rattling cell doors.  None of the incidents discussed above were shown to have presented any real or\\\\nimmediate threat to the security of the institution and certainly did not rise to the level of threatening serious injury\\\\nor loss of life. The Court finds as a fact that most, if not all, of these incidents were precisely the type of rules\\\\ninfractions concerning which the use of any type of physical force was intended to be prohibited by the\\\\ndepartmental policy statement.  They were, rather, incidents that should have been dealt with officially, if at all, by\\\\nmeans of the use of the disciplinary system.  Accordingly, it is clear that a pattern and practice exists of using\\\\nchemical agents against inmates when inadequate (if any) consideration was given by the officials involved to the\\\\n\\\\nthreshold question of whether a given situation warranted the use of any physical force at all, whether chemical\\\\nagents or otherwise. \\\\nChemical agents, such as mace and tear gas, have as an inherent characteristic the affecting of individuals other\\\\nthan those against whom they are specifically directed.  This is a fact that has not been given adequate\\\\nconsideration by the defendants and their agents in determining whether such agents should be used in given\\\\n415 situations.  The record reveals incidents in which these various *415 chemical agents were used against\\\\ndisorderly inmates under appropriate circumstances, but in excessive amounts.  The Court finds that while the\\\\nuse of chemical agents was not wholly unjustified, the manner and extent of their use was improper. \\\\nThe record also reveals incidents in which chemical agents were used against specific individual inmates under\\\\ncircumstances justifying the use of physical force as a behavior control measure, but where other reasonable\\\\nmeans of controlling the behavior of the specific inmates existed and where the chemical agents could not be\\\\nused without visiting their effects on other, innocent inmates.  The Court finds that the choice of chemical agents\\\\nas the behavior control device in such instances was not justified. \\\\nThe wardens and other high level officials at the penitentiary have routinely received reports of the improper use\\\\nof chemical agents by correctional officers, but have failed and refused to take any corrective action.  The Director\\\\nof the Department of Corrections is either unaware of or condones the continued violations of the Department\\\\'s\\\\npolicy, since the evidence of record reflects no action having been taken to seek to compel adherence to the\\\\nlimitations imposed by the Department\\\\'s own regulations. \\\\nMedical Care\\\\n17.  Defendants have maintained and operated a medical care delivery system at the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary which was and is incapable of providing, has failed to provide, and continues to fail to provide\\\\nadequate medical care for the inmates. \\\\nThe medical staff and facilities which are located at the main penitentiary at McAlester are relied upon to\\\\ndiagnose and treat the medical, dental and psychiatric problems of inmates throughout the penitentiary system. \\\\nPrior to the riot of July 27, 1973, the on-site medical staff, facilities, equipment and procedures at the Penitentiary\\\\nare systemically incapable of meeting the routine or emergency health care needs of the inmate population.  This\\\\nfacility and the equipment and records it contained were destroyed during the riot.  A temporary hospital ward has\\\\nbeen established in a former cellhouse and the security Captain\\\\'s office is now used as an examination room. \\\\nPortions of the medical research facility adjacent to the penitentiary have also been converted to use as an\\\\nexamination area for trustees.  It is obvious, however, that those inadequacies in plant and equipment which\\\\nexisted prior to the riot were aggravated by the riot and that no effective solution has been formulated. \\\\nProfessional dental care was supplied to the entire population by a series of part time dentists until July of 1973. \\\\nThough a full time dentist was hired at that time, no trained civilian support personnel have been hired to assist\\\\nhim.  This level of dental staffing is unable to meet the routine dental care needs of the population intended to be\\\\nserved.  Indeed, even if there were two dentists and they were provided minimal paradental support, they could\\\\nstill only be expected to treat 50 percent of the dental pathology involved. \\\\nThough approximately one half of the average in-patient population at the penitentiary is hospitalized for\\\\npsychiatric reasons, there is no professional psychiatric staff available for treatment on a regular basis.  A visiting\\\\npsychiatrist makes weekly visits pursuant to an informal agreement, but he has not assumed responsibility for the\\\\ncare of these patients.  The only \\\"treatment\\\" available at the penitentiary consists of temporary relief from\\\\n\\\"distress\\\" through sedation. \\\\nThe professional medical staff available to the inmate male population at the time of trial consisted of one fully\\\\nlicensed, part-time M.D., serving as chief medical officer, and two additional doctors who have institutional\\\\nlicenses which permit them to practice in state institutions, but only under the supervision of a fully licensed\\\\n416 physician.  The *416 services of the institutional licensed physicians have been equally divided between health\\\\ncare of inmates and operation of the plasmaphersis program at the penitentiary so that the services of only one of\\\\n\\\\nthem are normally available at any given time.  The actual services supplied by the chief medical officers have\\\\nvaried.  The chief medical officer at the time of the riot was supplying full time services.  Since his resignation, only\\\\npart-time services are provided by his successor, Dr. Karl Sauer, who also maintains an active, private\\\\northopedics practice in McAlester.  Part of Dr. Sauer\\\\'s time at the penitentiary is required to be spent on\\\\nadministrative matters. \\\\nFor many years, the penitentiary system has, for all practical purposes, been without any professionally trained\\\\nmedical support personnel whatsoever.  Due to shortages in staff, defendants have continuously relied on\\\\nunlicensed, untrained and unqualified correctional officers and other penitentiary employees, as well as inmate\\\\npersonnel, to perform clinical and related medical services which should be performed solely by licensed and\\\\nqualified professionals.  Such services performed by unqualified inmate and civilian personnel include, for\\\\nexample, screening medical complaints to determine which inmates on sick call will actually get to see a doctor,\\\\nas well as providing actual treatment and nursing care.  Subsequent to the riot, defendants have placed even\\\\ngreater reliance on such unqualified personnel at the main facility where almost the entire inmate population was\\\\nbeing held on 24 hour lockdown as recently as the time of this trial. The lockdown has in fact seriously\\\\nexacerbated previously existing problems in the medical area. \\\\nDefendants have endeavored, both before and since the riot, to supply some medical services by referrals to\\\\nvarious outside facilities.  This system of referrals, however, has failed to compensate for on-site deficiencies in\\\\nstaff and facilities and does not and cannot adequately meet the medical needs of the inmates. \\\\nThe past and present systemic medical deficiencies at O.S.P. have resulted in instances of actual impairment of\\\\ninmate health and continue to pose an actual and potential threat to the physical health and well-being of the\\\\nO.S.P. inmate population. \\\\nCorrespondence Rights\\\\n18.  Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of arbitrary and unreasonable restriction, interruption and\\\\ndelay of mail to and from inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. \\\\nDefendants have unduly restricted the inmates\\\\' opportunity to conduct sealed or privileged correspondence with\\\\ncounsel, the courts and other governmental agencies.  Incoming sealed correspondence has never been\\\\npermitted from any source and, until quite recently, all such incoming mail was opened and read.  Outgoing\\\\nsealed correspondence with attorneys, other than the correspondent\\\\'s single \\\"attorney of record,\\\" and to federal\\\\ncourts and government officials has also been denied privileged treatment, even after defendants purported to\\\\nrecognize limited \\\"privileged\\\" correspondence on or about February 2, 1973.  Accordingly, at least some letters to\\\\nand from courts, attorneys and government agencies continued to be opened, read, copied, recorded, and/or\\\\nrejected.  Furthermore, defendants\\\\' policy on privileged correspondence was never fully implemented.  In apparent\\\\ncontravention of that policy, the established practice of officers in charge of the various lockup facilities at the\\\\npenitentiary was to deny any sealed correspondence privilege to their charges. \\\\nAn additional barrier to the confidentiality of such correspondence has been the failure to provide notary services\\\\nwithin the secured areas of the pentitentiary.  Accordingly, legal documents which required notarization could not\\\\nbe sealed by the inmates, inasmuch as they were required to turn these matters in for notarizing, which was\\\\neffected outside their presence. \\\\n417 *417 At the supplemental pretrial conference held on December 6, 1973, counsel for the defendants tendered to\\\\nthe Court and opposing counsel a new Department of Corrections policy statement governing inmate\\\\ncorrespondence.  Implementation of the policy statement was not undertaken until very recently and the record is\\\\nunclear as to the exact manner in which the new policy has been applied in practice.  On its face the document\\\\npermits sealed out-going correspondence without restrictions.  All incoming mail is still to be opened.  Only\\\\ninspection for impermissible enclosures is expressly authorized, but reading is not actually prohibited.  Any\\\\ninspection is required to be conducted in the presence of the inmate addressee, if the mail is from an attorney. \\\\nThis procedure is expressly extended to inmates on lockup or \\\"segregated\\\" status. \\\\n\\\\nUnder the new policy no privilege is recognized with respect to mail from courts and government officials.  There\\\\nis no provision for solving the problem on confidentiality of outgoing mail requiring notarization.  Moreover, any\\\\ninmate whom unidentified officials determine has violated \\\"certain imposed guidelines\\\" will apparently be reduced\\\\nto the limited opportunity to conduct sealed correspondence, as recognized under the old policy. \\\\nThe new mail policy also eliminates a number of restrictions formerly applied to unprivileged mail.  Prior to and\\\\nduring most of the time this case has been pending, defendants severely restricted personal correspondence to\\\\nfive immediate family members, as approved by the penitentiary classification office.  No other \\\"personal\\\"\\\\ncorrespondence was allowed.  Mail of a non-personal nature was permitted, but only if the inmate\\\\'s classification\\\\nofficer made a determination that the particular communication was of a \\\"business\\\" nature.  No written rules or\\\\nguidelines defining \\\"business\\\" mail were ever established or made available either to the inmates or to the\\\\nemployees who were required to make such evaluations.  In practice, classification officers exercised this\\\\nundefined authority in a manner that rejected letters to and from ministers, attorneys, government officials and\\\\nother similar correspondents. \\\\nUnder the new mail policy, inmates may not correspond with outside businesses or institutions for the purpose of\\\\nsoliciting catalogues, fee samples or educational material, or for the purpose of conducting their own business. \\\\nRegardless of purpose, they may not conduct any correspondence with persons known to them only through\\\\nnewspaper or magazine ads, or with persons in prison who are not immediate family members.  There is a\\\\nseparate departmental policy statement governing the practice of religion which prohibits inmates from\\\\ncommunicating with ministers who are exconvicts. \\\\nIn addition to the foregoing expressed limitations, evidence in the record shows that certain inmates have not\\\\nbeen permitted to correspond with a San Francisco, California, prisoner aid group, believed by the inmates to be\\\\na possible source of legal services.  There is no indication of change in defendants\\\\' continuous, but unwritten,\\\\npolicy of prohibiting correspondence of any kind in a foreign language. \\\\nAs indicated above the new policy authorizes inspection, but neither authorizes nor prohibits the reading of\\\\nincoming mail.  On the other hand, there was never any express authority to read inmate mail under the prior\\\\npolicy.  Nevertheless, the actual practice at the penitentiary routinely involved the reading of inmate mail for the\\\\npurpose of discovering and rejecting mail containing \\\"gossip\\\" and \\\"improper language.\\\" There was no expressed\\\\npolicy, purpose, direction or standards for such censorship, so the employees authorized to censor such mail did\\\\nso on an entirely subjective basis. \\\\nPublications\\\\n418 19.  Defendants have in the past prohibited and continue to prohibit inmate *418 subscriptions to, receipt and/or\\\\npossession of certain magazines and newspapers. \\\\nIn the past, the official written rule was that subscriptions could be obtained to any periodicals on the approved\\\\nperiodical list.  In fact, such a list did not exist.  Decisions on individual requests to subscribe to various periodicals\\\\nwere made on a case-by-case basis, by penitentiary personnel, guided by essentially no promulgated standards\\\\nor procedures. \\\\nAfter the riot, a practice was instituted that prevented inmates from subscribing to any newspapers or periodicals. \\\\nQuite recently, there has actually been promulgated an approved periodicals list.  As will be set forth in greater\\\\ndetail, this list still operates to exclude legal and religious periodicals.  No procedure has been promulgated\\\\nwhereby inmates may seek to obtain approval for subscriptions to periodicals not on the approved list.  In fact,\\\\nthey have been advised that all periodicals not on the list are contraband.  The Court takes judicial notice that\\\\ninnumerable publications containing protected speech have not been included on the current approved list. \\\\n\\\\nAccess to the Courts\\\\n20.  The defendants have failed to provide an adequate law library or any reasonably and adequate alternative\\\\nthereto.  The library, such as it is, is located in a wood frame shelter attached to the wall of the main rotunda. \\\\nBecause of its size, approximately ten feet by six feet, only two or, at most, three inmates can use the facility at\\\\nany one time.  The facility is so lacking in legal reference books and publications as to constitute no library at all.\\\\nFor example there are no reports of decisions by the United States Supreme Court or lower Federal Courts. \\\\nInmates are prohibited from assisting one another on legal matters and in preparing their legal papers since such\\\\nassistance may permissibly be provided only by a law librarian.  In practice, penitentiary officials have also\\\\nfollowed a policy of preventing inmates from acquiring legal books.  In addition, inmates have been and are now\\\\nprohibited from subscribing to any legal periodicals and have been denied the right to have in their possession\\\\nany personal legal materials or other assets belonging to them and acquired for the purpose of working on their\\\\nlegal problems, although the latter prohibition has recently been relaxed. \\\\nFor extended periods of time, the law library has been closed to inmates because no librarian was available.  It is\\\\nnoted that during the year 1973, except for approximately six weeks, no law librarian was employed by the\\\\npenitentiary.  During such periods an inmate could use the library only if a classification officer was available to\\\\naccompany him and to and open the library for him.  Approximately 15 percent of the inmate population is illiterate\\\\nand the sixth or seventh grade average reading ability of the population is less than that which is required for\\\\neffective use of the more common legal reference materials.  As is noted above, only the institutional \\\"law\\\\nlibrarian\\\" may permissibly assist these and other inmates on legal matters.  The use of the term \\\"law librarian\\\" is\\\\nmisleading since no librarian employed by the penitentiary has had any legal training.  When such a librarian has\\\\nbeen available he has been able to assist only three or five inmates per day. Inmates frequently must wait up to\\\\nfive weeks to receive assistance, if it is available at all. Inmates on lockup, regardless of the length of\\\\nconfinement, are prohibited from using the law library.  They are only provided with legal forms which may be\\\\nused to file petitions with the courts.  Male inmates from subsidiary facilities must request transfers to the main\\\\nfacility at McAlester in order to use the library facilities.  Women inmates are afforded no library privileges and\\\\nmust depend upon visits from the law librarian, when one is employed and is available.  Recently a new employee\\\\n419 was hired to perform the functions *419 of a law librarian.  This employee is classified as a correctional officer I,\\\\nbut due to illness, has been unavailable for some time.  It is heartening to note from the record that the\\\\ndefendants have made plans for upgrading the law library facilities, employing a full-time attorney and engaging\\\\nthe services of law students to provide legal assistance to inmates.  However, such plans have not as yet been\\\\nimplemented and the conditions mentioned above still prevail. \\\\nReligious Freedom\\\\n21.  Inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary who follow the Muslim faith do not, because of their religious\\\\nbeliefs, eat pork or any food mixed with pork or pork by-products.  Said inmates have on numerous occasions\\\\npetitioned penitentiary officials to provide them with pork free meals.', ' It is\\\\nnoted that during the year 1973, except for approximately six weeks, no law librarian was employed by the\\\\npenitentiary.  During such periods an inmate could use the library only if a classification officer was available to\\\\naccompany him and to and open the library for him.  Approximately 15 percent of the inmate population is illiterate\\\\nand the sixth or seventh grade average reading ability of the population is less than that which is required for\\\\neffective use of the more common legal reference materials.  As is noted above, only the institutional \\\"law\\\\nlibrarian\\\" may permissibly assist these and other inmates on legal matters.  The use of the term \\\"law librarian\\\" is\\\\nmisleading since no librarian employed by the penitentiary has had any legal training.  When such a librarian has\\\\nbeen available he has been able to assist only three or five inmates per day.

Women inmates are afforded no library privileges and\\\\nmust depend upon visits from the law librarian, when one is employed and is available.  Recently a new employee\\\\n419 was hired to perform the functions *419 of a law librarian.  This employee is classified as a correctional officer I,\\\\nbut due to illness, has been unavailable for some time.  It is heartening to note from the record that the\\\\ndefendants have made plans for upgrading the law library facilities, employing a full-time attorney and engaging\\\\nthe services of law students to provide legal assistance to inmates.  However, such plans have not as yet been\\\\nimplemented and the conditions mentioned above still prevail. \\\\nReligious Freedom\\\\n21.  Inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary who follow the Muslim faith do not, because of their religious\\\\nbeliefs, eat pork or any food mixed with pork or pork by-products.  Said inmates have on numerous occasions\\\\npetitioned penitentiary officials to provide them with pork free meals.  Penitentiary officials have refused and still\\\\nrefuse to provide the pork free meals so requested.  Defendants have failed to provide special diets, even when\\\\nrequested by the medical staff for medical patients, and nutritional analyses of penitentiary menus show that\\\\nthere are vitamin and protein deficiencies in the diet generally provided inmates. \\\\nIt is common knowledge that many meals are prepared with pork or pork by-products.  However, the Court cannot\\\\ndetermine with specificity, from the menus placed in the record, the extent to which pork or pork by-products are\\\\nused in the food now served to the inmates.  Of course, pork served in its natural state is easily discernible, but\\\\nmeals seasoned with pork are often difficult of detection.  The record is devoid of any evidence indicating that\\\\ninmates are advised of foods actually prepared with pork or pork by-products.  It naturally follows that those\\\\ninmates whose religious beliefs prevent the eating of pork in any form, are often forced either to chance that the\\\\nfood they eat is free of pork or to refuse the food altogether.  Because of the dietary deficiencies found to exist in\\\\nthe regular meals now being prepared and served to all inmates, the Court finds that inmates who follow the\\\\nMuslim teachings cannot obtain an adequate diet by foregoing the eating of food prepared with pork and will, if\\\\n\\\\nthey attempt to follow the tenets of their faith, receive a diet even more deficient than that received by other\\\\nprisoners. \\\\nMuslim inmates have also been deprived of the oppportunity to gather together for group religious services.  It is\\\\nunclear for what periods this condition prevailed prior to the riot, since there is evidence in the record that some\\\\narrangement for such meetings had been made through the auspices of the Catholic Chaplain.  Subsequent to\\\\nthe riot, there has been a total ban on group religious services regardless of denomination.  This prohibition\\\\nappears to have had a greater impact on the Muslims, because such services provide their only opportunity for\\\\nreligious guidance.  Protestants and Catholics at the penitentiary have at least the services of a civilian chaplain\\\\nwith whom individual consultations may be arranged however brief or unsatisfactory they may be. \\\\nReligious periodicals have not been included on the various official and unofficial approved periodical lists that\\\\nhave been in effect at the penitentiary at diverse times.  Moreover, Muslim publications entitled \\\"Elijah Muhammad\\\\nSpeaks\\\" and \\\"The Message to the Black Man in America\\\" have been and are specifically prohibited by a\\\\ndepartmental policy statement dated April 25, 1968.  No factual justification for the exclusion of these two specific\\\\npublications is shown.  Likewise, no justification whatsoever is shown for the failure to include religious\\\\npublications generally on the various approved periodicals lists. \\\\nMembers of the Muslim sect at McAlester have earnestly urged this Court that their religious principles have been\\\\noffended by their integration with non-Muslim inmates.  For the reasons set forth in the Court\\\\'s discussion of racial\\\\nintegration this aspect of the Muslim complaint will not be honored and must be rejected. \\\\n420 *420 It is also claimed that none of the guards presently employed at the penitentiary are followers of Muslim\\\\nfaith.  The Court has no reason to doubt this assertion, but finds no evidence that this condition has been the\\\\nresult of or has resulted in any direct or covert discrimination based upon religion or race. \\\\nFinally, the Muslim plaintiffs have complained that following the July 27 riot, they were locked up because of their\\\\nreligious beliefs.  The Court notes that the entire population at McAlester was and continues to be locked up\\\\nunder punitive conditions which it finds deplorable.  There is, however, no evidence that Muslims, because of their\\\\nbeliefs, have been subjected to conditions or restrictions more punitive than other inmates of the Penitentiary. \\\\nPrior Findings of this Court\\\\nThe trial in this case was heard on March 14, and 15, 1973, following a series of individual pro se cases\\\\npresented to the court during the week of March 11.  At the close of this trial, the Court entered a series of\\\\npreliminary findings which dealt in general terms with the numerous unconstitutional conditions and practices\\\\nwhich have been described in greater detail herein.  The Court further found from the totality of the record, that\\\\nplaintiff as well as the other inmates at McAlester are entitled to such injunctive and mandatory relief, as is\\\\nnecessary to correct the deprivations of rights which have occurred in the past and will continue unless enjoined\\\\nby order of this Court.\\\\nThe requests for additional relief were, however, denied because of evidence of contributing fault on the part of\\\\ninmates.  Accordingly, it was and is the determination of this Court that the record does not support the award of\\\\nmoney damages to any prisoner nor is there evidence which would warrant the release of any prisoner from\\\\nconfinement prior to serving his full sentence. \\\\nConclusions of Law\\\\nJurisdiction\\\\n1.  This Court has jurisdiction of this case. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1343(3) & (4). \\\\n2.  The Attorney General of the United States was authorized to intervene in this action on behalf of the United\\\\nStates pursuant to Section 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000h-2. \\\\n\\\\n3.  \\\"Federal courts sit not to supervise prisons but to enforce the constitutional rights of all `persons,\\\\' which\\\\ninclude prisoners.  We are not unmindful that prison officials must be accorded latitude in the administration of\\\\nprison affairs, and that prisoners necessarily are subject to appropriate rules and regulations.  But persons in\\\\nprison, like other individuals, have the right to petition that Government for redress of grievances.\\\" Cruz v.\\\\nBeto, 405 U.S. 319, 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 1081, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972).  While federal courts are \\\"reluctant to\\\\nintervene in matters of prison administration,\\\" Hoggro v. Pontesso, 456 F.2d 917 (C.A. 10, 1972), the record in\\\\nthis case has led this Court to conclude that the defendants have been and are operating the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary in a manner which violates many rights secured to inmates by the Constitution and laws of the\\\\nUnited States.  \\\"[A] policy of judicial restraint cannot encompass any failure to take cognizance of valid\\\\nconstitutional claims whether arising in a federal or state institution.  When a prison regulation or practice offends\\\\na fundamental constitutional guarantee, federal courts will discharge their duty to protect constitutional rights.  \\\\nJohnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 486, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969).\\\" Procunier v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___,\\\\n94 S.Ct. 1800, 1807, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974). \\\\nRacial Discrimination and Segregation\\\\n421 4.  A state policy or practice of racial segregation in the operation of detention facilities violates the equal *421\\\\nprotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Washington v. Lee, 263 F.Supp. 327 (N.D.Ala.1966), aff\\\\'d; Lee v.\\\\nWashington, 390 U.S. 333, 88 S.Ct. 994, 19 L.Ed.2d 1212 (1968); Wilson v. Kelley, 294 F.Supp. 1005\\\\n(N.D.Ga.1968) aff\\\\'d 393 U.S. 266, 89 S.Ct. 477, 21 L. Ed.2d 425 (1968).  Racial segregation of correctional\\\\nfacilities cannot be justified on the basis that integration may result in inmate violence.  United States v.\\\\nWyandotte County, 480 F.2d 969 (C. A. 10, 1973) (per curiam); cert. denied 414 U.S. 1068, 94 S.Ct. 577, 38\\\\nL.Ed.2d 473 (1973); McClelland v. Sigler, 327 F.Supp. 829 (D.Neb.1971) aff\\\\'d, 456 F. 2d 1266 (C.A. 8, 1972) (per\\\\ncuriam). \\\\n5.  The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits racial discrimination in any aspect of\\\\nprison administration.  Privileges must be afforded equally to prisoners of all races.  Rivers v. Royster, 360 F.2d\\\\n592 (C.A. 4, 1966); Jackson v. Godwin, 400 F.2d 529 (C.A. 5, 1968); Owens v. Brierley, 452 F.2d 640 (C.A. 3,\\\\n1971).  Specifically, prison officials may not discriminate on the basis of race when making job assignments or\\\\nadministering discipline.  Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881, 901 (N.D.Miss., 1972) (appeal\\\\npending). \\\\n6.  The present cessation of segregation in inmate housing coming subsequent to the filing of a lawsuit due to\\\\nemergency conditions beyond defendants\\\\' control is insufficient grounds upon which to conclude there is \\\"no\\\\nreasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.\\\" N. L. R. B. v. Raytheon Co., 398 U.S. 25, 27, 90 S.Ct.\\\\n1547, 1549, 26 L.Ed.2d 21 (1970); United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed.\\\\n1303 (1953). \\\\nIn light of the prolonged practice of segregation prior to the riot in contravention of stated policy, and because of\\\\nthe uncertainty of post-riot conditions and the importance of the rights at stake, judicial relief continues to be both\\\\nappropriate and necessary.  Rowe v. General Motors Corp., 457 F.2d 348 (C. A. 5, 1972); United States v. West\\\\nPeachtree Tenth Corp., 437 F.2d 221, 228 (C.A. 5, 1971). \\\\nProcedural Due Process\\\\n7.  The due process clause proscribes any serious disciplinary sanctions against an inmate unless he is found to\\\\nhave violated written rules which are adequately promulgated prior to the commission of the infraction charged\\\\nand which describe punishable conduct with reasonable precision.  Sinclair v. Henderson, 331 F.Supp. 1123\\\\n(E.D.La.1971); Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss. 1972) (appeal pending). \\\\n8.  Summary punishment is unconstitutional; serious disciplinary sanctions may not be imposed on inmates\\\\nwithout a hearing.  Inmates who are charged with infractions must be given official written notice of the specific\\\\ncharges against them.  This notice must be given a reasonable time prior to conducting the hearing.  Sinclair v.\\\\n\\\\nHenderson, supra; Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971); Nolan v. Scafati, 430 F.2d 548 (C.A. 1, 1970)\\\\n; Landman v. Royster, 333 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Va.1971); see also, Black v. Warden, 467 F.2d 202 (C.A. 10, 1972). \\\\n9.  The determination to impose serious disciplinary sanctions on prisoners must be made by an impartial\\\\ndecision-maker Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971), cert. denied sub nom. Sostre v. Oswald, 404\\\\nU.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972). \\\\n10.  The impartial disciplinary tribunal may not in effect abdicate sentencing responsibility by permitting line\\\\nofficers to determine the length of confinement.  Accordingly, a denial of procedural due process results where\\\\nindefinite lockup sentences are imposed without a regular, meaningful and independent review reasonably\\\\ndesigned to enable the disciplinary tribunal or some other responsible disinterested administrative official or body\\\\n422 to make its own *422 determination regarding duration of confinement. \\\\nSee, Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973); Gray v. Creamer, 465 F.2d 179 (C.A. 3, 1972); United\\\\nStates ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, 467 F.2d 51 (C.A. 2, 1972). \\\\n11.  The imposition of significant additional restrictions or sanctions on inmates who have already been placed on\\\\ndisciplinary lockup requires the same procedural safeguards as apply at the time of the original punishment.  \\\\nAdams v. Carlson, supra; Palmigiano v. Baxter, 487 F.2d 1280, 1284-1285 (C.A. 1, 1973). \\\\n12.  Automatic detention of inmates prior to disciplinary hearings can result in a denial of procedural due process. \\\\nWhether awaiting institutional or judicial proceedings or both, such inmates should be segregated only if a\\\\nreasonable basis exists therefore (e. g., their continued presence in general population status poses an actual\\\\nthreat to the security of the institution) and then only for a reasonable time until the disciplinary committee can\\\\nconvene to hear the case. The pre-riot practice at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary of having the disciplinary\\\\ncommittee meet weekly is not an adequate one for this purpose.  Such hearings must be held as soon as is\\\\npracticable under the circumstances.  Absent unusual and reasonably sufficient extenuating circumstances,\\\\nprehearing detention in excess of 48 hours (72 hours if a weekend intervenes) is presumptively unreasonable.  \\\\nLandman v. Royster, 354 F.Supp. 1292, 1294 (E. D.Va.1973). \\\\n13.  Even where the confinement of an inmate under punitive conditions is denominated and processed as an\\\\nadministrative, rather than a disciplinary matter, the indefinite confinement of inmates under such conditions,\\\\nwithout standards or criteria, and without minimal procedural safeguards, violates the due process clause of the\\\\nFourteenth Amendment.  United States ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, D.C., 338 F.Supp. 311, affirmed, 467 F.2d 51\\\\n(C.A. 2, 1973); Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973); Gray v. Creamer, 465 F.2d 179 (C.A. 3, 1973); \\\\nHoward v. Smyth, 365 F.2d 428 (C.A. 4, 1966); Diamond v. Thompson, 364 F.Supp. 659 (M.D.Ala.1973); Allen v.\\\\nNelson, 354 F.Supp. 505 (N.D.Cal.1973); Bowers v. Smith, 353 F.Supp. 1339 (D.Vt.1972). \\\\nCruel and Unusual Punishment\\\\na. In General\\\\n14.  The prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment is applicable to the State of\\\\nOklahoma through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660,\\\\n82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962). \\\\n15.  It is established that the Eighth Amendment does not have fixed, settled and definite limits.  The \\\"Amendment\\\\nmust draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\\\" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958).  This Court subscribes to the view\\\\nof the Eighth Circuit:\\\\n\\\"In summary, then so far as the Supreme Court decisions are concerned, we have a flat\\\\nrecognition that the limits of the Eighth Amendment\\\\'s proscription are not easily or exactly defined,\\\\nand we also have clear indications that the applicable standards are flexible, that disproportion,\\\\nboth among punishments and between punishment and crime, is a factor to be considered, and\\\\n\\\\nthat broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency are useful\\\\nand usable.\\\" Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 579 (C.A. 8, 1968).  In short, the parameters of the constitutional prohibition are\\\\nnot rigidly defined and are, in effect, discernible only in the context of specific factual situations. \\\\n423 16.  \\\"Cruel and unusual punishment may be inflicted by the unconscionable *423 penalty imposed by statute or by\\\\nthe inhumane execution of a permissible penalty imposed under a constitutionally permissible statute.\\\" Bethea v.\\\\nCrouse, 417 F.2d 504, 507-508 (C.A. 10, 1969).  While the great majority of cases involving the Eighth\\\\nAmendment have involved one or more specific acts directed at selected individuals (e. g., Trop v. Dulles, supra),\\\\nthe constitutional prohibition is equally applicable to general conditions of confinement.  Holt v. Sarver, 309\\\\nF.Supp. 362, 372-373 (E.D. Ark.1970), aff\\\\'d 442 F.2d 304 (C.A. 8, 1971); Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621\\\\n(E.D.Va.1971); Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss.1972) (appeal pending). \\\\nb. Use of Chemical Agents\\\\n17.  Chemical mace and tear gas inevitably inflict physical pain and discomfort upon, and can cause permanent\\\\nphysical injury and even death to the individual(s) against whom they are used.  Accordingly, the use of such\\\\nchemical agents to punish inmates constitutes a form of corporal punishment. \\\\n18.  At least in a State such as Oklahoma where State law clearly proscribes the use of corporal punishment, Title\\\\n57 O.S.A. \\u00a7 31, the use of corporal punishment on inmates is also cruel and unusual within the meaning of the\\\\nEighth Amendment. \\\\n19.  Whether or not proscribed by State law, the use of chemical agents such as mace or tear gas as a punitive\\\\nmeasure rather than a control device results in the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the\\\\nEighth Amendment.  Landman v. Royster, 333 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Va.1971).  See also Morales v. Turman, 364\\\\nF.Supp. 166, 173 (E.D.Tex.1973) (involving Texas juvenile detention facilities). \\\\n20.  That chemical agents have been used as a punitive measure may be inferred from evidence showing that\\\\nsuch agents are employed unnecessarily (i.  e., without proper justification based on a reasonable concern for the\\\\nsecurity of the institution) or with justification, but in excessive amounts.  See Landman v. Royster, supra.\\\\n21.  The established pattern of unreasonable and excessive use of chemical agents at the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary has resulted in summary, as well as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and\\\\nFourteenth Amendments. \\\\nc. Conditions of Confinement\\\\n22.  Solitary confinement per se does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661\\\\n(C.A. 5, 1971); Graham v. Willingham, 384 F.2d 367 (C.A. 10, 1967).  Such confinement may constitute cruel and\\\\nunusual punishment, however, if it is maintained in a manner fairly characterized as foul, inhuman and violative of\\\\nbasic concepts of human decency, Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 526 (C.A. 2, 1967).  In most of the cases in\\\\nwhich the conditions in solitary confinement have been condemned, the inmates were held in dark cells where\\\\npersonal hygiene was impossible due to the lack of materials necessary for personal sanitation and/or the\\\\ninability to properly dispose of body waste.  See e. g., LaReau v. MacDougall, 473 F.2d 974 (C.A. 2, 1972) cert.\\\\ndenied, 414 U.S. 878, 94 S.Ct. 49, 38 L.Ed.2d 123 (1973); Wright v. McMann, supra; Hancock v. Avery, 301\\\\nF.Supp. 786 (M.D.Tenn. 1969); Jordan v. Fitzharris, 257 F. Supp. 674 (N.D.Cal.1966).  Such conditions have\\\\nprevailed in the subterranean isolation area referred to as \\\"the hole.\\\" The conditions found to exist in the isolation\\\\ncells in the maximum security unit approach, but do not, standing alone, reach the level of cruel and unusual\\\\npunishment.  Nevertheless, confinement in dark, unventilated and unsanitary isolation cells without any means of\\\\nmental or emotional diversion if imposed for prolonged periods will result in conditions which equal cruel and\\\\nunusual punishment.  See, Morales v. Turman, 364 F.Supp. 166 (E.D.Tex.1973).  Cf. Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661,\\\\n424 671 (C.A. 5, *424 1971) (partial dissenting opinion); Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971) cert. denied\\\\nsub nom. Sostre v. Oswald, 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972). \\\\n\\\\n23.  Prisoners held in segregation for security or other non-disciplinary reasons must be provided as many of the\\\\nprivileges enjoyed by the general population as the nature of their confinement allows.  Landman v. Royster, 354\\\\nF.Supp. 1292, 1294-1295 (E.D.Va. 1973); Allen v. Nelson, supra.\\\\n24.  Where inmates are confined to their cells for periods up to one year and subjected to continual and enforced\\\\nidleness without affording them any opportunities for physical exercise, voluntary work, or educational programs,\\\\nit must be concluded that such conditions of confinement constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of\\\\nthe Eighth Amendment.  Hamilton v. Love, 328 F.Supp. 1182 (E.D.Ark., 1971); Sinclair v. Henderson, 331 F. Supp.\\\\n1123 (E.D.La.1971); cf.Osborn v. Manson, 359 F.Supp. 1107 (D.Conn. 1973). \\\\nd. Denial of Medical Care\\\\n25.  Inmates have a basic right to receive needed medical care while they are confined in prison.  Edwards v.\\\\nDuncan, 355 F.2d 993 (C.A. 4, 1966); Coppinger v. Townsend, 398 F.2d 392 (C. A. 10, 1968); Schack v. Florida,\\\\n391 F. 2d 593 (C.A. 5, 1968), cert. denied, 392 U.S. 916, 88 S.Ct. 2080, 20 L.Ed.2d 1376 (1968); Martinez v.\\\\nMancusi, 443 F.2d 921 (C.A. 2, 1970); Sawyer v. Sigler, 320 F.Supp. 690 (D.Neb.1970), aff\\\\'d 445 F.2d 818 (C.A.\\\\n8, 1971). \\\\n26.  As a necessary corollary of that right, prison officials have an affirmative duty to make available to inmates a\\\\nlevel of medical care which is reasonably designed to meet the routine and emergency health care needs of\\\\ninmates.  Fitzke v. Shappell, 468 F.2d 1072 (C.A. 6, 1972); Campbell v. Beto, 460 F.2d 765 (C.A. 5, 1972); Gates\\\\nand United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss.1972) (appeal pending); Newman v. Alabama, 349\\\\nF.Supp 278 (M.D.Ala.1972) (appeal pending); cf.Jones v. Wittenberg, 330 F.Supp. 707 (N.D.Ohio, 1971) affirmed\\\\nsub nom. Jones v. Metzer, 456 F.2d 854 (C.A. 6, 1972); Chapman v. Gilligan, No. 8700 (S.D.Ohio, March 16,\\\\n1973).  While a prisoner is not entitled to the medical care of his choice, Coppinger v. Townsend, supra, Judge\\\\nDaugherty has held that \\\"a failure to provide needed medical care by one having custody of a prisoner may under\\\\ncertain circumstances afford a prisoner a cause of action under Civil Rights Act.\\\" (Elsberry v. Haynes, 256\\\\nF.Supp. 738 (W.D.Okl.1966). \\\\n27.  The actionable circumstances result where, as here, the level of medical care available to a confined and\\\\ndependent population is inadequate to meet predictable health care needs because of obvious and sustained\\\\ndeficiencies in professional staff, facilities and equipment.  When continued and systemic deficiencies of this\\\\nnature exist and have resulted in the actual impairment of inmate health, and when such deficiencies continue to\\\\npose a current and potential threat to the physical health and wellbeing of an entire prison population, then\\\\ninmates are deprived of the basic elements of adequate medical treatment in violation of the Eighth Amendment,\\\\nCampbell v. Beto, supra, and are also subjected to disabilities beyond those contemplated by incarceration, in\\\\nviolation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Fritzke v. Shappell, supra.\\\\nCorrespondence and Publication\\\\n28.  Inmates have a preferred constitutional right to correspond with attorneys, courts and government officials for\\\\nthe purpose of petitioning government and the courts for the redress of grievances.  LeVier v. Woodson, 443 F.2d\\\\n360 (C.A. 10, 1971); Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971) cert. denied sub nom. Sostre v. Oswald,\\\\n425 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972); Palmigiano v. Travisono, *425 317 F.Supp. 776 (D.R.I.1970)\\\\n.  The confidentiality of such correspondence may not be arbitrarily denied by prison officials, who are the likely\\\\nsubjects of an inmate\\\\'s grievances.  Defendants\\\\' practice of limiting confidential treatment to correspondence with\\\\none attorney, state courts and state government officials, but not with their federal counterparts, constitutes an\\\\narbitrary and unreasonable intrusion upon the inmates\\\\' right freely to petition their government and the courts. \\\\nSee, Palmigiano v. Travisono, supra.\\\\n29.  This Court does not conclude that prison officials may not regulate or restrict forms of prisoner mail.  Because\\\\nof its impact on the First Amendment rights of \\\"freeworld\\\" as well as inmate correspondents, however, the\\\\ncensorship of such mail must meet the constitutional standards which are generally applied to governmental\\\\n\\\\nregulation of protected speech.  Accordingly, it must be shown that prison mail censorship furthers an important\\\\ngovernmental interest unrelated to the suppression of speech and that the mode of censorship results in\\\\nlimitations which are no greater than are necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental\\\\ninterest involved.  Procunier v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___, 94 S. Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); United States v.\\\\nO\\\\'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).  Prison mail regulations which automatically limit\\\\ninmates to personal correspondence with a fixed number of immediate family members work an arbitrary and\\\\nunconstitutional prior restraint on the protected speech of both inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents. \\\\nSuch overly broad restrictions have been imposed on inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary solely to serve\\\\nthe administrative convenience of the defendants, without furthering any demonstrated interest in the orderly\\\\noperation of the institution or the rehabilitation of its inmates.  Procunier v. Martinez, supra; Morales v. Schmidt,\\\\n489 F.2d 1335 (C. A. 7, January 17, 1973) (rehearing en banc, May 29, 1973, 494 F.2d 85); LeMon v. Zelker, 358\\\\nF.Supp. 554 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \\\\n30.  Defendants\\\\' policy of intercepting, censoring and rejecting incoming and outgoing inmate correspondence\\\\nbased on unwritten and/or ill-defined prohibitions against \\\"improper language\\\" or \\\"gossip\\\" including \\\"false\\\\nstatements to any correspondents\\\" is overbroad on its face and has in fact been applied in such a manner as to\\\\ninfringe upon the protected speech of inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents.  Procunier v. Martinez, supra;\\\\nAdams v. Carlson, 352 F.Supp. 882 (E.D.Ill.1973) reversed in part on other grounds, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973);\\\\ncf.LeMon v. Zelker, supra; Palmigiano v. Travisono, supra.\\\\n31.  Whether based upon the identity or characteristics of the correspondents (as in the case of approved list\\\\nrestrictions), or upon the content of their specific communications (such as \\\"gossip\\\" and \\\"improper language\\\"),\\\\nthe restriction and/or censorship of prison mail deprives both inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents of the\\\\n\\\"liberty\\\" of free speech.  Accordingly, due process requires that the determination to censor must be based on\\\\nfacts rationally determined pursuant to such procedures as are necessary to insure fairness.  Such minimum\\\\nprocedural safeguards include notice to the interested correspondent(s) and a reasonable opportunity to protest\\\\nthe decision of a prison official other than the person who originally disapproved the correspondence.  Martinez v.\\\\nProcunier, D.C., 354 F.Supp. 1092, affirmed, Procunier v. Martinez, supra.\\\\n32.  Restrictions on the free flow of information to prison inmates in the form of general circulation newspapers\\\\nand magazines results in a denial of the First Amendment rights of such inmates, unless the State can show that\\\\n426 such restrictions are reasonably necessary to the preservation of security, good order or discipline within the *426\\\\npenitentiary or the rehabilitation of the inmates.  Fortune Society v. McGinnis, 319 F.Supp. 901 (S.D.N.Y.1970); \\\\nLaaman v. Hancock, 351 F.Supp. 1265 (D. N.H.1972).  The past and present restrictive practices of the\\\\ndefendants, pertaining to the acquisition and retention of general circulation newspapers and magazines have\\\\ngone far beyond any possible legitimate needs based on the preservation of security, good order or discipline\\\\nwithin the penitentiary or the rehabilitation of the inmates.  Such rules that have existed and such practices as\\\\nhave been in effect have been arbitrary and capricious on their face and as applied.  The legitimate interest of\\\\ninmates in having access to the information, both social and educational, to be found in these various types of\\\\nperiodicals far outweighs any legitimate interest of penal administration or any proper regard to be afforded the\\\\nexpertise and discretionary authority of competent correctional officials.  When prison officials conclude that\\\\neffective security, good order or rehabilitation require the censorship of such material, then with respect to each\\\\nobjectionable publication, the basis for the determination, including a written notice setting forth the relevant facts\\\\nwith respect to the particular publication, shall be provided to each inmate who seeks to obtain it.  Such inmates\\\\nshall be provided a reasonable opportunity to submit additional facts and views to the decision maker before such\\\\ndetermination becomes final.  Laaman, supra; Sostre v. Otis, 330 F.Supp. 941 (S.D.N.Y.1971); See Procunier v.\\\\nMartinez, supra. If it is possible to do so without defeating the purpose of the proposed exclusion, the inmate\\\\nshould be allowed to examine the allegedly offensive material and set forth reasons in writing as to why he feels it\\\\nshould not be excluded.  In any event, the actual, final decision to exclude a specific issue of any general\\\\ncirculation publication shall be made by the Warden or Deputy Warden, who shall prepare and retain on file a\\\\ndetailed statement of the specific basis for each such exclusion for any jurisdictional court review. \\\\n\\\\nAccess To The Courts\\\\n33.  Prisoners, no less than other persons, have a constitutional right of access to the courts.  Johnson v. Avery,\\\\n393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L. Ed.2d 718 (1969).  \\\"`Regulations and practices that unjustifiably obstruct the\\\\navailability of professional representation or other aspects of the right of access to the courts are invalid.\\\\' Ex parte\\\\nHull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L. Ed.2d 1034 (1941).\\\" Procunier v. Martinez, supra.\\\\n34.  To be meaningful, the right of access to the courts must include the means to frame and present legal issues\\\\nand relevant facts effectively for judicial consideration. \\\\n35.  Because the state has substantial control over the activities of convicted prisoners and because many\\\\nprisoners are indigent and poorly educated, prison officials have an affirmative constitutional duty to provide them\\\\nwith the necessary means for obtaining access to courts. \\\\nPrison law libraries are a basic means of assisting inmates to that end.  Gilmore v. Lynch, 319 F.Supp. 105 (N.D.\\\\nCal.1970), affirmed, Younger v. Gilmore, 404 U.S. 15, 92 S.Ct. 250, 30 L.Ed.2d 142 (1971); Hooks v. Wainwright,\\\\n352 F. Supp. 163 (M.D.Fla.1972).  The defendants have, at various times and in various ways, attempted to\\\\nprovide some form of legal assistance to inmates.  The Court concludes however that the law library and legal\\\\nassistance program at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary have failed to provide these disadvantaged inmates with\\\\nconstitutionally adequate access to the courts.  Johnson v. Avery supra; Gilmore v. Lynch, supra; Hooks v.\\\\nWainwright, supra.\\\\n\\\"The constitutional guarantee of due process of law has as a corollary the requirement that\\\\n427 prisoners be afforded access to the courts in order to *427 challenge unlawful convictions and to\\\\nseek redress for violations of their constitutional rights.\\\" Procunier v. Martinez, supra. (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the requirement levied on\\\\nthe State of Oklahoma in this area of constitutional application extends to insuring adequate access to the courts\\\\nregarding at least habeas corpus actions, civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 and out-of-time appeals.  Cf.\\\\nJustice After Trial: Prisoners\\\\' Need for Legal Services in the Criminal Correctional Process, 18 Kan.L.Rev.  493\\\\n(1970). \\\\n36.  A state may not prohibit inmate self-help or mutual inmate assistance in legal matters unless it provides them\\\\nwith some reasonable, alternative means of protecting their right of access to the courts.  Johnson v. Avery, supra.\\\\nDefendants in this case have unconstitutionally interfered with inmates\\\\' protected attempts to obtain timely,\\\\neffective access to the courts in numerous ways.', 'Procunier v. Martinez, supra.\\\\n34.

A state may not prohibit inmate self-help or mutual inmate assistance in legal matters unless it provides them\\\\nwith some reasonable, alternative means of protecting their right of access to the courts.  Johnson v. Avery, supra.\\\\nDefendants in this case have unconstitutionally interfered with inmates\\\\' protected attempts to obtain timely,\\\\neffective access to the courts in numerous ways.  This unconstitutional interference has extended to attempts by\\\\ninmates to seek and receive the assistance of attorneys, Procunier v. Martinez, supra; to acquire, retain and use\\\\npersonal legal materials such as law books, legal periodicals, and such other assets as are used in the course of\\\\nworking on one\\\\'s personal legal problems, Cruz v. Hauck, 404 U.S. 59, 92 S.Ct. 313, 30 L.Ed.2d 217 (1971),\\\\nAdams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973), and to assist one another in the preparation of legal documents\\\\nin the absence of a constitutionally adequate alternative.  Johnson v. Avery, supra; See also, Procunier v.\\\\nMartinez, supra.\\\\nReligious Freedom\\\\n37.  Where the precepts of a religious sect call for its adherents to engage in a religious practice which does not\\\\npresent a threat to the security, discipline and good order of the institution, the state has the burden of justifying\\\\npolicies or practices which prevent such inmates from engaging in such religious practices.  See, Cooper v. Pate,\\\\n378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1964); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263\\\\n(1972); Long v. Parker, 390 F.2d 816 (C.A. 3, 1968); Brown v. Peyton, 437 F.2d 1228 (C.A. 4, 1971). \\\\n38.  The court finds no valid justification for defendants continuing policy of denying inmates including Muslims the\\\\nopportunity to gather together for corporate religious services.  Walker v. Blackwell, 411 F.2d 23 (C.A. 5, 1969); \\\\n\\\\nLong v. Parker, 390 F.2d 816; Northern v. Nelson, 315 F.Supp. 687 (N.D.Cal.1970); affirmed, 448 F.2d 1266 (C.A.\\\\n9, 1971); Banks v. Havener, 234 F.Supp. 27 (E.D.Va.1964); Williford v. California, 352 F.2d 474 (C.A. 9, 1965). \\\\n39.  In the instant case, the defendants have not offered any justification to support their food distribution practices\\\\nwhich prevent Muslim inmates from adhering to their religious practice of abstaining from the consumption of pork\\\\nand pork by-products.  Such practices cannot be squared with the First Amendment rights of the inmates and, on\\\\nthe basis of the record in this case, are an unconstitutional application of state power.  See, Barnett v. Rodgers,\\\\n133 U.S.App.D.C.  296, 410 F.2d 995 (1969). \\\\n40.  In order to justify a proscription against religious publications, including Muslim literature, officials have the\\\\nburden of showing that such publications present a threat to security, discipline and good order within the\\\\ninstitution that cannot otherwise be overcome.  Rowland v. Jones, 452 F.2d 1005 (C.A. 8, 1971); Brown v. Peyton,\\\\nsupra; Long v. Parker, supra. In the instant case no such showing has been made with respect to the prohibited\\\\npublications entitled \\\"Message to the Black Man\\\" and \\\"Muhammad Speaks.\\\" Relief\\\\n41.  It is within the authority and is indeed the responsibility of this court to order that all violations of federal\\\\n428 constitutional and civil rights, *428 and of rights and privileges secured by the laws, regulations and policies of\\\\nthe State of Oklahoma, cease forthwith.  The Court is loath to consider the necessity of closing the Oklahoma\\\\nState Penitentiary at McAlester as a direct or indirect result of its orders.  Inmates v. Eisanstadt, 360 F.Supp. 676,\\\\n691 (D. Mass.1973) affirmed, 494 F.2d 1196 (C. A. 1, 1974); Cf.Hamilton v. Love, 328 F.Supp. 1182, 1194\\\\n(E.D.Ark.1971).  Notwithstanding the grossly offensive conditions and treatment of inmates found to exist at the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester, it is also within the authority of this Court to refrain, in its discretion,\\\\nfrom entering at this time any order that would require or have the effect of requiring the closing of the\\\\npenitentiary.  The Court concludes that, at this time, the interests of all parties to the case and the public interest\\\\nwould be best served by the Court affording the authorities of the State of Oklahoma and of the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary the opportunity to bring conditions and treatment of inmates at the penitentiary into conformity with\\\\nthe requirements of the United States Constitution, federal civil rights laws, and the laws, regulations and policies\\\\nof the State of Oklahoma. \\\\nJUDGMENT, DECREE, INJUNCTION AND ORDER FOR REMEDIAL\\\\nACTION\\\\nIn accordance with the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth above, and because of the determination\\\\nby the Court that it is necessary for an order to issue in this case and to be in effect during the time that may be\\\\nnecessary for the formulation, approval and implementation of plans for complete relief, it is\\\\nOrdered that the defendants, their officers, agents, servants, employees and all other persons in active concert or\\\\nparticipation with them, and all their successors in office, who receive actual or constructive notice of this Order\\\\nby personal service or otherwise as hereinafter provided, are hereby enjoined from operating the facilities of the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary McAlester, Oklahoma, in any manner inconsistent with the following provision of this\\\\nOrder:\\\\nOrder on Racial Segregation and Discrimination\\\\n1.  Racial discrimination in any aspect of the operations of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary shall cease forthwith\\\\nand forever. \\\\n2.  All future cell or other housing assignments at the penitentiary, whether initial or subsequent, shall be made in\\\\naccordance with a classification and assignment system in which the race of the inmate is not a factor\\\\nconsidered.  All requests by inmates for transfers from one cell or other housing assignment to another shall also\\\\nbe processed and decided without regard for the race of the inmate making the transfer request. \\\\n\\\\nIn order to insure that the mandates set forth in this paragraph are not allowed to operate so as to perpetuate\\\\nsegregation or facilitate resegregation, the warden shall set as a goal that all major housing units (cell blocks,\\\\ndormitories, runs, etc.) should generally approximate in their respective racial compositions the racial composition\\\\nof the inmate population as a whole.  This is not to be an inflexible rule, as legitimate considerations within the\\\\noperating scope of a valid, non-racially biased classification and assignment system may well produce some\\\\nimbalances in this regard.  The warden shall, however, on a quarterly basis, report to the Director of the\\\\n[*]\\\\nDepartment of Corrections, with copies to all counsel of record in this case,  a detailed justification for each\\\\nmajor housing unit that deviates more than 10% in either direction in the racial composition of its population from\\\\nthe racial composition of the inmate population as a whole. \\\\n429 *429 The warden of the penitentiary shall insure that there is no segregation within major housing units of the\\\\npenitentiary. \\\\n3.  All inmates shall have an equal opportunity to be considered fairly for assignment to and advancement within\\\\nall jobs that are or may become available at the penitentiary.  To assist in insuring that this is achieved, no\\\\npreference shall be given in future job assignments on the basis of any inmate\\\\'s previous work experience at the\\\\npenitentiary, where such preference would have a racially discriminatory effect.  Validly applicable work\\\\nexperience prior to entering the penitentiary and any relevant formal education or training may of course be\\\\nconsidered. \\\\n4.  Records will hereafter be maintained at the penitentiary which will include the identity of the person(s) making\\\\neach initial or subsequent job or housing assignment and the basis for such assignment.  If the previous practice\\\\nof assigning inmates only to departments or industries for work is reinstituted, with the specific job assignments\\\\nbeing made within the gaining department or industry, the records of the penitentiary shall include this same\\\\ninformation regarding each job assignment or reassignment within each department or industry.  If there are job\\\\npromotions available to inmates, the records concerning each promotion actually effected shall include the\\\\nreason(s) why the promoted inmate was selected and the name(s) of the other inmate(s) considered for that\\\\npromotion. \\\\n5.  Affirmative action to overcome the effects of past discrimination in the operation of housing, dining and\\\\nrecreational facilities, job assignments and the disciplinary system shall be formulated and implemented. \\\\nConceding that certain of these operations are either not carried on at the present time, or are carried on at a\\\\nlevel far below that which was in effect prior to July 27, 1973, it must nonetheless be recognized that the\\\\nrestoration of normal operations at the penitentiary could present the grave likelihood of the past pattern and\\\\npractice of pervasive racial discrimination being restored as well. \\\\nThe defendants shall, within 60 days from the date of this Order, formulate and submit to counsel for the plaintiffs\\\\nand the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the court for consideration and approval, their plan for the total\\\\neradication of any present segregation and other forms of racial discrimination, for overcoming the continuing\\\\npresent effects of segregation and other forms of racial discrimination as heretofore practiced at the Oklahoma\\\\nState Penitentiary, and for precluding the reinstitution of any discriminatory practices which were in effect prior to\\\\nJuly 27, 1973. \\\\nThe plan so submitted shall include, but not be limited to, provisions for the on-going examination of all operating\\\\nprocedures within the penitentiary for possible discriminatory effects; provisions for training present and future\\\\nstaff in the area of human relations, and the timetable for conducting such training; provisions for effective\\\\nstatistical and other checks and reviews at the administration level within the penitentiary; and provisions for\\\\nadditional checks and reviews within the Department of Corrections. \\\\nThe plan so submitted shall also include the details of a procedure for the review and analysis of records\\\\nmaintained pursuant to paragraph 4 of this order.  To overcome the effects of past discrimination in job\\\\nassignments, the plan will also include a requirement, as to any specific job category wherein the racial\\\\ncomposition of the inmate group assigned to that job category deviates more than 10% in either direction from\\\\nthe racial composition of the inmate population as a whole, that a detailed justification for each such deviation be\\\\n\\\\nprepared on a quarterly basis.  Such justifications shall be submitted over the signature of the warden of the\\\\npenitentiary to the director of the Department of Corrections and to all counsel of record in this case.\\\\n430 *430 To insure the eradication of discrimination in the operation of the penitentiary disciplinary system, the plan\\\\nshall also include provision for appropriate training for all individuals who prepare, investigate, review or process\\\\ninmate disciplinary reports, as well as all individuals who sit on or review the results of the proceedings of\\\\ndisciplinary committees, and all individuals who review, approve or consider appeals from the results of such\\\\ndisciplinary proceedings. \\\\nOrder of Procedural Due Process\\\\n6.  The Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pertaining to this subject make it indisputably clear that the\\\\ndisciplinary system as it existed and exists at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary has failed to meet constitutional\\\\nrequirements in almost every possible regard.  Nonetheless, the Court is not unmindful of the disparate views that\\\\nexist among judges, penologists and experts as to precisely what quantum of process is \\\"due\\\" in all of the\\\\ndifferent kinds of disciplinary proceedings that necessarily go on in a penitentiary.  A similar disparity of views\\\\nexists with regard to many of the administrative decisions that must be made in the ordinary course of prison\\\\nadministration, but which can have serious effects on the inmates concerned.  The Court is firmly of the opinion\\\\nthat the best disciplinary system is one that is universal, in the sense of being carefully constructed to deal\\\\nappropriately, but nonetheless fairly, with all of the varying kinds and degrees of offenses and rules infractions\\\\nthat can be and are committed in this or any other penitentiary.  The same is true with regard to the administrative\\\\ndecision-making process by means of which significant administrative decisions affecting inmates are made. \\\\n7.  Accordingly, the Court will make no effort at this time to prescribe a complete set of rules and regulations\\\\nregarding procedural due process, or even to provide detailed guidelines as to what would constitute an\\\\nappropriate and constitutional disciplinary system for the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, nor will it do so regarding\\\\nthose aspects of the penitentiary\\\\'s administrative decision-making process that have led to constitutional\\\\nviolations in the past.  If it is possible to do so, it is far preferable for those provisions necessary to overcome past\\\\nconstitutional deficiencies to be fashioned as part of an organic whole 00 that is, of a comprehensive system. \\\\n97\\\\n8.  In the course of the preparation for and presentation of this case, counsel for the plaintiffs, the plaintiff-\\\\nintervenor and the defendants have gained a possibly unique perception of the problems herein involved.  The\\\\nCourt therefore directs counsel for the parties to confer and attempt in good faith and in a spirit of cooperation to\\\\nfashion a detailed, comprehensive disciplinary system for the penitentiary system to which all parties can agree in\\\\na submission to the Court. The Court further directs counsel so to confer regarding the administrative mechanism\\\\n(s) by means of which decisions are made that significantly impinge upon the rights, interest, welfare and\\\\nrehabilitative potential of the inmates of the penitentiary.  Even if total agreement concerning these matters is not\\\\npromptly achieved, the Court directs that counsel persist in their efforts and insure that as much as possible is\\\\nworked out through the process of negotiation and agreement.  The final product of this undertaking will be\\\\nsubmitted to the Court for consideration and approval not more than 60 days from the date of this decree, and will\\\\nbe accompanied by (if necessary) submissions on behalf of each party regarding those points concerning which\\\\nagreement has not been possible and constitutional interests are involved. \\\\n9.  The purpose of the Court in promulgating the foregoing portion of its decree is to attempt to insure that the\\\\ndisciplinary system and the administrative decision-making machinery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary are\\\\nconstitutional in all respects, but are at the same time adequate to fulfill the real needs of discipline and\\\\n431 administration *431 within the penitentiary.  These goals are not mutually exclusive. \\\\n10.  In the interim, the following rules shall apply:\\\\na. No inmate shall be disciplined in any manner except for violation of a written rule, promulgated\\\\nprior to the commission of the offense charged, which, in general terms at least, was adequate to\\\\nhave given the inmate reasonable notice that the conduct subsequently alleged as the basis for\\\\nthe charge could constitute a punishable act; this does not, of course, require that every possible\\\\n\\\\nset of facts that could be charged must be set forth with particularity, but it does prohibit punishing\\\\nan inmate for conduct that he did not reasonably know could be the basis for punishment;\\\\nb. No summary punishment shall be inflicted, although this does not preclude a correctional officer\\\\nfrom reprimanding or warning an inmate that repetition or continuation of particular conduct could\\\\nor will result in a disciplinary charge being filed;\\\\nc. Inmates charged with infractions must be given official written notice of the charges against\\\\nthem and, in reasonably specific terms, the conduct that formed the basis for the charge, said\\\\nnotice to be given a reasonable time prior to any hearing that must or may be held on such\\\\ncharges;\\\\nd. No written charge shall be disposed of nor significant disciplinary sanction imposed on any\\\\ninmate without a hearing at which the inmate is accorded a reasonable opportunity to be heard\\\\nand to present his defense to, explanation of, or matters in mitigation regarding the charge(s)\\\\nagainst him;\\\\ne. The members of the disciplinary hearing shall be impartial; as a minimum, no person who was\\\\ninvolved in bringing, investigating or processing any charge shall sit on the panel that determines\\\\nthe guilt of the inmate of that charge or the punishment, if any, to be imposed as a result. \\\\nf. Disciplinary charges against inmates shall be disposed of, by hearing or otherwise, as soon as\\\\npracticable and such disposition shall not be delayed pending possible action in the civil courts\\\\nconcerning the same or related matters. \\\\ng. If disciplinary sanctions are imposed that include indefinite terms in lockup, disciplinary\\\\nsegregation, etc., there shall be a review of the need for the continuation of such status on a\\\\nregular basis, either by the disciplinary panel that imposed the sanction, by an alternate or\\\\namended panel the members of which are impartial as defined above, or by a high-ranking,\\\\ndisinterested administrative official at the penitentiary; no correctional officer performing duty in\\\\nthe lockup area where the inmate is confined shall participate in the process of deciding whether\\\\ncontinued confinement is warranted, except that he may make such reports as to the inmate\\\\'s\\\\nbehavior as are routinely required by penitentiary regulations and may make recommendations,\\\\nwith reasons therefor, as to whether continued confinement is so warranted;\\\\nh. Inmates on disciplinary lockup shall not be subjected to significant additional restrictions or\\\\nsanctions except in accordance with a procedure that comports with the requirements of\\\\nparagraph 10 a-f, supra.\\\\ni.  Inmates who allegedly commit offenses or other rules infractions shall not be placed in pre-\\\\nhearing detention unless a reasonable basis exists therefor, such as the fact that their continued\\\\npresence in general population poses an actual threat to the security of the institution; absent\\\\nunusual and sufficient circumstances, pre-hearing detention in excess of 48 hours (72 hours if a\\\\nweekend is involved) shall be presumptive evidence of a violation of paragraph 10 f of this Order;\\\\nand\\\\nj. To insure that no inmate is punished in violation of the provisions of this paragraph through a\\\\n432 process of *432 denominating the procedure employed \\\"administrative,\\\" rather than \\\"disciplinary\\\"\\\\nin nature, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply generally to any administrative action to be\\\\ntaken that could result in the inmate being confined under punitive conditions; if an inmate is\\\\nplaced in administrative segregation pending investigation of serious charges against him, the\\\\nreview process required by paragraph 10 g shall insure that the investigation is being conducted\\\\nwith all practicable expedition, or the inmate shall be released from such status. \\\\n\\\\nOrder on Conditions of Confinement\\\\n11.  Any future use of that form of disciplinary status which was known officially as \\\"72 hour detention\\\" and which\\\\ninvolved confinement in the subterranean isolation area commonly known as \\\"the hole\\\" is prohibited. \\\\n12.  Effective immediately, before any inmate is confined in an isolation cell in the Maximum Security Unit,\\\\ncompliance with the procedures of paragraph 10, supra, is required. \\\\nWithin 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall submit to counsel for the plaintiff and the plaintiff-\\\\nintervenor for comment, and to the court for consideration and approval, a proposed set of comprehensive\\\\nregulations intended to govern future confinement in the isolation cells in the Maximum Security Unit.  These\\\\nproposed regulations shall set forth the conditions and treatment to be provided inmates confined in such cells\\\\nand a maximum time limit for the duration of such confinement.  Prior to submitting these proposed regulations to\\\\nthe Court, the defendants shall have said regulations reviewed by competent medical authorities, not employed\\\\nby or connected with the Department of Corrections, who shall also inspect the isolation cells themselves.  No\\\\nproposed set of regulations shall be submitted to the Court that is not accompanied by a statement from said\\\\nmedical authorities to the effect that confinement in these cells, under the conditions included in the proposed\\\\nregulations and found to exist at the time the cells are inspected by said medical authorities, under the treatment\\\\nprocedures called for in the proposed regulations, and for the maximum duration provided for in the proposed\\\\nregulations, does not constitute an unreasonable risk to the physical or psychological well-being of an inmate so\\\\nconfined. \\\\n13.  Inmates who are confined in any form of administrative segregation shall be accorded as many of the\\\\nprivileges enjoyed by general population inmates, to the extent enjoyed by those inmates, as the nature and\\\\npurpose of their confinement in administrative segregation will allow.  This provision applies, notwithstanding the\\\\nfact of compliance, where appropriate, with the provisions of paragraph 10, supra.\\\\n14.  All inmates shall be afforded a reasonable time outside their cells, daily, for the purpose of exercise or other\\\\nform of recreation.  This provision shall be effective 10 days from the date of this decree.  Weather permitting,\\\\ngeneral population inmates shall be allowed outdoors during at least part of this exercise period.  If at all possible,\\\\ninmates in administrative segregation and disciplinary segregation shall also be allowed outdoors for this\\\\npurpose. \\\\n15.  Within 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall cause to be made a study of the actual diet\\\\nbeing furnished to the inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.  This study shall be conducted by an individual\\\\n(s) qualified in the areas of diet and nutrition.  The results of this study shall be submitted in the form of a report to\\\\nthe Court, with copies to counsel for the plaintiff and the plaintiff-intervenor, and shall cover at least the caloric\\\\nand nutritional adequacy of said diet.  The report shall also address itself to the specific question of whether\\\\nMuslim inmates are receiving the opportunity to be adequately fed (in terms of both calories and nutrition),\\\\nwithout having to eat items prepared with pork or pork by-products. \\\\n433 *433 16.  Until other programs for the useful and constructive occupation of the general population are instituted\\\\nor resumed, defendants shall undertake to provide inmates with all practicable means for mental diversion and/or\\\\nself-improvement while confined to their cells. \\\\nThis portion of the Court\\\\'s decree could be satisfied by offering inmates an opportunity to participate in \\\"cell\\\\nstudy\\\" programs, similar to those offered to invalid students in other state institutions. \\\\nOrder on Use of Chemical Agents\\\\n17.  The unjustified use of chemical agents against inmates is prohibited.  They shall not be used against\\\\nindividual inmates, or against small groups of them, except as authorized by the policy statement of the\\\\nOklahoma State Department of Corrections dated January 4, 1973.  To support the use of this form of physical\\\\nforce, the requirement of that policy statement that there be an actual and imminent threat of death or bodily\\\\n\\\\nharm must be present.  Chemical agents may also be used to quell an actual or incipient riot involving a large\\\\nnumber of unconfined inmates, where there is present an actual and imminent threat of death or bodily harm, or\\\\nan actual and imminent threat of serious damage to or the destruction of property which is substantial in quantity\\\\nand/or value.  They may also be used to thwart the imminent escape of an inmate or inmates. \\\\n18.  Whenever chemical agents are used against an inmate or inmates, all reasonable precautions shall be taken\\\\nto avoid or minimize inflicting the effects thereof on innocent inmates. \\\\n19.  Chemical agents shall not be used to enforce silence or otherwise to enforce the rules and regulations of the\\\\npenitentiary, unless the conditions set forth in paragraph 17 are present.  It will be an exceptional situation in\\\\nwhich the use of these agents can be justified against an inmate locked in his cell.  Even where a large number of\\\\ninmates locked in their cells are involved in a disturbance, chemical agents shall not be used if they are merely\\\\nnoisy, or shaking the doors of their cells (so long as the doors remain secure), or because of anything they may\\\\nsay to or shout at any member of the penitentiary staff.  These and similar rules infractions on the part of inmates\\\\nare properly dealt with by means of the penitentiary disciplinary system, with due process safeguards, rather than\\\\nsummarily. \\\\n20.  As is the case with any use of physical force against inmates, the use of chemical agents must never exceed\\\\nthat reasonably required to effect the legitimate ends of penitentiary officials.  Accordingly, the use of chemical\\\\nagents against inmates, on the rationale that the actual situation is one which could develop into 00 although it has\\\\n97\\\\nnot yet become 00 one in which the use of such agents is permitted, constitutes the excessive use of physical\\\\n97\\\\nforce and is prohibited both by the departmental policy statement of January 4, 1973, and by this Order. \\\\n21.  Every incident involving the use of any chemical agent against any one or more inmates shall be reported in\\\\nwriting by the warden to the director, with copies to all counsel of record in this case, within three days of the\\\\nincident until further order of the Court. A full and complete statement of all relevant circumstances shall be\\\\nincluded in such reports. If, in the opinion of the warden, further investigation is required, he shall denominate the\\\\nreport an interim report and shall submit a final report when the entire investigation is completed, but not less\\\\nthan ten days after the incident.  Any justified modification of the factual statement set forth in the interim report\\\\nshall be included in this final report. \\\\n22.  Within the parameters delineated by this Order, there remains great scope for the proper exercise of\\\\njudgment and sound discretion on the part of penitentiary officials.  The proper exercise of such judgment and\\\\n434 discretion should not be superseded by any Court and will not *434 be by this one.  The contrary proposition is\\\\nequally necessary, however; the unconstitutional use of chemical agents against inmates can neither be\\\\npermitted nor condoned.  What the Court has condemned in this Order is not the use of chemical agents in\\\\nsituations where the use of physical force against inmates is justified, but where reasonable men might differ on\\\\nthe kind or degree of necessary force.  The Court has condemned the use of chemical agents in situations where\\\\nthe use of any physical force is unjustified. \\\\nOrder on Medical Care\\\\n23.  Within 60 days from the date of this Order, the defendants shall formulate a comprehensive plan for providing\\\\nconstitutionally adequate routine and emergency medical care (including psychiatric care) to all inmates at the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary.  This plan shall be submitted to counsel for the plaintiffs and for the plaintiff-\\\\nintervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval. \\\\n24.  This plan shall include, but need not be limited to, the provisions necessary for the operation of an in-patient\\\\nmedical facility within the secured area of the penitentiary (or in such close proximity thereto that security\\\\nconsiderations will not unreasonably delay the receipt of needed medical care by inmates in the security area). \\\\nThis in-patient facility shall comply in its operating procedures, staffing, equipment and physical plant with the\\\\nregulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Health governing the licensure of hospitals and related\\\\ninstitutions, or with some other set of comprehensive standards generally accepted within the medical profession. \\\\nThe staffing provisions of the plan shall provide as a minimum:\\\\n\\\\na. nursing care 24 hours a day, seven days a week;\\\\nb. a full-time Chief Medical Officer;\\\\nc. the equivalent of one additional full-time doctor;\\\\nd. an adequate support staff of qualified generalist or specialist medical para-professionals;\\\\ne. such additional dental and dental support staff as will bring dental care in the penitentiary\\\\nsystem to an acceptable level; and\\\\nf. a designated staff member to be responsible for insuring that adequate in-patient psychiatric\\\\ncare and treatment are provided. \\\\nThe plan shall also specify the extent to which medical facilities and personnel outside the penitentiary system\\\\nare being relied upon to provide medical care for inmates and the specific means by which such outside care will\\\\nbe secured.  Also included will be appropriate provisions pertaining to the control, storage, handling and\\\\ndistribution of all medications. \\\\n25.  Pending the formulation, approval and implementation of such plan, the defendants shall insure that each\\\\ninmate who goes on sick call is seen by a medical doctor or by a fully-qualified health para-professional (e. g.,\\\\nphysician\\\\'s assistant, medical technician, etc.).  No individual member of the staff or inmate population who is not\\\\na fully-qualified health professional or para-professional shall inhibit, prevent or obstruct any inmate from going\\\\non sick call.\\\\nOrder on Correspondence and Publications\\\\n26.  The confidentiality of any inmate\\\\'s outgoing correspondence to any attorney, court, or government official or\\\\nagency shall not be abridged.  This provision is specifically applicable to mail to be sent to any court which is\\\\nrequired by that court to be notarized.  Incoming correspondence from any of these sources may be opened and\\\\ninspected for contraband, but only in the presence of the inmate-addressee, and may not be delayed or read. \\\\n435 27.  With respect to all other correspondence to and from inmates of the *435 penitentiary system, the Court has\\\\npreviously noted with approval the recent, significant improvement in defendants\\\\' policies.  Within 60 days from\\\\nthe date of this decree, defendants shall submit whatever modifications of their existing policies, specific\\\\npractices or operating procedures in this area are deemed by them to be required or warranted in the light of the\\\\nprovisions of Conclusions of Law 29-31, inclusive, supra, or the recent decision of the United States Supreme\\\\nCourt in the case of Procunier v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974).  Such shall be\\\\nsubmitted, together with a written presentation of their unmodified policies, practices and operating procedures in\\\\nthe form of a single, proposed comprehensive regulation for consideration and approval by the Court. Copies of\\\\nthis submission shall also be sent to counsel for the plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment.  No inmate,\\\\nwhether enjoying unrestricted or restricted correspondence status under defendants\\\\' existing policy statement,\\\\nshall be subjected to any arbitrary limitations on the number of approved correspondents, the identity thereof, etc.\\\\n28.  With respect to general circulation publications, such as newspapers and magazines, a comprehensive\\\\nregulation, consistent with all aspects of Conclusion of Law 32, supra, shall be submitted within 60 days from the\\\\ndate of this decree, to counsel for the plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for\\\\nconsideration and approval.  This plan shall include all of the necessary and reasonable rules with which an\\\\ninmate must comply in order to subscribe to any such general circulation publication.  It shall also include those\\\\ndetailed internal operating procedures necessary to insure that any present, continuing effects of past arbitrary\\\\nand capricious practices in this area are overcome. \\\\n29.  No decision shall be made to exclude any publication except as may be required by the needs of security,\\\\ngood order, or rehabilitation; nor shall any such decision be made by any penitentiary official other than the\\\\nWarden or Deputy Warden, and then only after full compliance with the applicable provisions of Conclusion of\\\\nLaw 32, supra, regarding notice, opportunity to submit additional facts, etc. Any decision to exclude shall be\\\\n\\\\nmade solely on the basis of the content of the specific publication in question and the official actually making the\\\\ndecision shall prepare and retain on file a detailed statement of the specific basis for each such exclusion. \\\\nOrder on Access to the Courts\\\\n30.  Within 60 days from the date of this Order, the defendants shall prepare and submit to counsel for the plaintiff\\\\nand plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval, a comprehensive plan for\\\\ninsuring that inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary have adequate and effective access to the Courts.  The\\\\nplan shall consider and address the problem of reasonable access in terms of habeas corpus petitions, \\u00a7 1983\\\\nand other civil rights matters, out-of-time appeals, and such other matters as are addressed more particularly in\\\\nthe Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, supra. In order to insure that effective access is available\\\\nthroughout the penitentiary system, appropriate consideration shall be given to the number of inmates in the\\\\npenitentiary system, the fact of their geographic dispersion, the anticipated number of requests for post-\\\\nconviction legal assistance, and the educational level of the overall inmate population. \\\\n31.  Pending the information, approval and implementation of such a plan, the defendants shall forthwith refrain\\\\nfrom interfering with the acquisition or possession by inmates of legal materials, including transcripts, lawbooks,\\\\nlegal periodicals, paper, etc. They shall also arrange for capable and experienced inmates to be allowed to help\\\\n436 those who require assistance in order to be able effectively to frame and present legal issues *436 and relevant\\\\nfacts for judicial consideration. \\\\n32.  The defendants shall forthwith advise all inmates that they are permitted to subscribe to any legal periodical\\\\nand to seek to obtain lawbooks and legal assistance by mail.  The defendants shall insure that the inmates\\\\nunderstand that they are permitted to purchase and possess legal periodicals and books specifically dealing with\\\\nthe legal problems of inmates and that they are authorized to write to organizations concentrating on such\\\\nproblems in an effort to obtain legal assistance, reference materials, etc.\\\\nOrder on Religious Freedom\\\\n33.  Defendants shall forthwith cease all unreasonable interference with the provision to inmates of spiritual\\\\ncounselling and the opportunity to engage in group religious services. \\\\n34.  Defendant shall forthwith advise all inmates of the penitentiary system that they may subscribe to and receive\\\\nreligious publications, including books, newspapers and magazines, unless any such publication demonstrably\\\\npresents a threat to security, discipline and good order within the institution that cannot otherwise be overcome. \\\\nMuslim inmates shall forthwith be advised specifically that the above authority to subscribe to and receive\\\\nreligious publications extends to the publications entitled \\\"Message to the Black Man\\\" and \\\"Muhammad Speaks.\\\" They shall also be advised of every food item served to the inmates of the penitentiary that is known or believed\\\\nby the defendants to contain pork or pork by-products. \\\\n35.  Within 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall advise the Court, in writing, with copies to\\\\ncounsel for plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor, of the progress to date and of all future plans for providing religious\\\\ncounselling and group services, and of the fact of compliance with the remaining provisions of this portion of the\\\\nCourt\\\\'s decree. \\\\nOrder on Security and Staffing\\\\n36.  The Court has found that there were and are serious deficiencies in the level of overall security within the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary.  In different ways, this involves the security of the institution itself, the personal\\\\nsecurity of the members of the staff and the inmates who, as wards of the state, are entitled to and indeed must\\\\nlook to the state to reasonably insure their safety.  The Court has further found that these security deficiencies are\\\\nin large measure due to both a serious shortage of staff at the penitentiary and to a very high turnover among\\\\nstaff members.  Many of the unconstitutional conditions and practices that exist at the pentitentiary (or which\\\\n\\\\nexisted in the recent past and have present continuing effects) cannot be corrected without a considerable\\\\nimprovement in these areas of security and staffing. \\\\n37.  Accordingly, counsel for the defendants shall, within 60 days of the date of this Order, submit to counsel for\\\\nthe plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval, a plan for\\\\neffecting promptly all necessary improvement in the areas of security and staffing. \\\\n38.  In the interim, the defendants are advised that alleged shortages of staff shall not be deemed to constitute an\\\\nacceptable reason for the failure to comply fully with any provision of this decree.', ' Defendants shall forthwith cease all unreasonable interference with the provision to inmates of spiritual\\\\ncounselling and the opportunity to engage in group religious services. \\\\n34.  Defendant shall forthwith advise all inmates of the penitentiary system that they may subscribe to and receive\\\\nreligious publications, including books, newspapers and magazines, unless any such publication demonstrably\\\\npresents a threat to security, discipline and good order within the institution that cannot otherwise be overcome. \\\\nMuslim inmates shall forthwith be advised specifically that the above authority to subscribe to and receive\\\\nreligious publications extends to the publications entitled \\\"Message to the Black Man\\\" and \\\"Muhammad Speaks.\\\" They shall also be advised of every food item served to the inmates of the penitentiary that is known or believed\\\\nby the defendants to contain pork or pork by-products. \\\\n35.  Within 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall advise the Court, in writing, with copies to\\\\ncounsel for plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor, of the progress to date and of all future plans for providing religious\\\\ncounselling and group services, and of the fact of compliance with the remaining provisions of this portion of the\\\\nCourt\\\\'s decree. \\\\nOrder on Security and Staffing\\\\n36.  The Court has found that there were and are serious deficiencies in the level of overall security within the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary.  In different ways, this involves the security of the institution itself, the personal\\\\nsecurity of the members of the staff and the inmates who, as wards of the state, are entitled to and indeed must\\\\nlook to the state to reasonably insure their safety.  The Court has further found that these security deficiencies are\\\\nin large measure due to both a serious shortage of staff at the penitentiary and to a very high turnover among\\\\nstaff members.  Many of the unconstitutional conditions and practices that exist at the pentitentiary (or which\\\\n\\\\nexisted in the recent past and have present continuing effects) cannot be corrected without a considerable\\\\nimprovement in these areas of security and staffing. \\\\n37.  Accordingly, counsel for the defendants shall, within 60 days of the date of this Order, submit to counsel for\\\\nthe plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval, a plan for\\\\neffecting promptly all necessary improvement in the areas of security and staffing. \\\\n38.  In the interim, the defendants are advised that alleged shortages of staff shall not be deemed to constitute an\\\\nacceptable reason for the failure to comply fully with any provision of this decree.  Unless specifically provided to\\\\nthe contrary herein, alleged security considerations shall also be deemed not to constitute an acceptable reason\\\\nfor the failure to comply fully with any provision of this decree. \\\\nOrder on General Provisions\\\\n39.  Certain difficulties that arose in the course of the trial of this case would have been more readily resolved if\\\\npermanent records had previously been maintained of inmate housing assignments, by cell-block and cell,\\\\n437 beginning with each inmate\\\\'s initial assignment *437 and showing the inclusive dates of it and all subsequent\\\\nassignments.  Furthermore, compliance with certain provisions of this decree will be more readily determined if\\\\nsuch records are maintained.  Accordingly, the defendants are directed to annotate the permanent records kept on\\\\neach inmate with his present housing assignment and to insure that subsequent assignments are also recorded\\\\ntherein. \\\\n40.  Counsel for plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor will have access at all reasonable times to such records as are\\\\nmaintained concerning penitentiary inmates, whether or not required to be kept by this decree.  They shall also\\\\nhave unimpeded access to individual inmates at all reasonable times for purposes of conducting interviews to\\\\nascertain whether there has been compliance with all provisions of this decree.  Counsel for plaintiff-intervenor\\\\nare specifically authorized to utilize Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for these purposes. \\\\n41.  If any of the defendants shall have any doubt or question as to the meaning, scope or application of any\\\\nprovision of this decree, the inquiry shall be submitted to the Court in writing in a communication from counsel for\\\\nthe defendant(s).  The responsive communication from the Court will also be in writing.  Copies of all such\\\\ncommunications shall be placed in the file of this case and concurrently served upon counsel for the plaintiffs and\\\\nplaintiff-intervenor.  The same procedure shall apply to any such inquiries that may be deemed necessary by\\\\ncounsel for the plaintiffs or the plaintiff-intervenor. \\\\nThe defendants are charged with the duty of fully explaining the terms of this decree to all of their agents,\\\\nservants, representatives and employees, including penitentiary staff, guards and other personnel, and to assure\\\\ntheir understanding of the court\\\\'s requirements and the necessity for strict compliance therewith. \\\\n42.  The Court retains jurisdiction of this case for all purposes and specifically reserves the power to issue further\\\\nand supplemental orders in aid of the provisions of this injunction or any of its terms.  The Court also reserves for\\\\ndetermination all issues not dealt with expressly herein. \\\\n43.  In lieu of service by the United States Marshal, the Clerk of this Court is hereby directed to send by United\\\\nStates mail a certified copy of this Order to each of the defendants in this case and to any other individuals\\\\nidentified in the Preliminary Statement as having succeeded in office any of the named defendants. \\\\n[*] For purposes of mailings, counsel of record will include Mary E. Bane, Quinlan J. Shea, Jr. and Paul Crowe. \\\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 108,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 42,\n        \"samples\": [\n          21,\n          23,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(df)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Dqu0mTuf9ovK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747085873853,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Rachel Gao","userId":"10157902458628963651"}},"outputId":"c74f680e-5421-4034-8fe6-cd9df416a5ad"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["800"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["MODEL.to('cuda')\n","\n","BATCH_SIZE = 12\n","\n","for index, row in tqdm(df.iterrows(), total=len(df)):\n","    case_id = row[\"case_id\"]\n","    #print(f\"Processing: \", index)\n","\n","    chunks = ast.literal_eval(row[\"chunks\"])\n","\n","    all_embeddings = []\n","\n","    for i in range(0, len(chunks), BATCH_SIZE):\n","        batch = chunks[i:i + BATCH_SIZE]\n","\n","        # Tokenize and move inputs to GPU\n","        inputs = TOKENIZER(batch, max_length=8192, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n","        inputs = {k: v.to('cuda') for k, v in inputs.items()}\n","\n","        # Run model on batch\n","        with torch.no_grad():\n","            outputs = MODEL(**inputs)\n","            last_hidden_state = outputs.last_hidden_state  # shape: [batch, seq_len, hidden_dim]\n","            #print(\"lhs: \", last_hidden_state.shape)\n","\n","            mean_embeddings = last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)  # shape: [batch, hidden_dim]\n","            all_embeddings.append(mean_embeddings.cpu())\n","\n","        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n","\n","    # Combine all embeddings: [n_chunks, hidden_dim]\n","    all_embeddings_tensor = torch.cat(all_embeddings, dim=0)\n","    final_embedding = all_embeddings_tensor.mean(dim=0).numpy()\n","    #print(\"embed: \", final_embedding.shape)\n","\n","    df.at[index, 'mean_embedding'] = final_embedding.astype(object)\n","\n","    torch.cuda.empty_cache()"],"metadata":{"id":"YGJgZfMpgrPJ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"ab61d41c-5696-457d-81b8-6c7e4618cb8a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747097495517,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":11621663,"user":{"displayName":"Rachel Gao","userId":"10157902458628963651"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["  0%|          | 0/800 [00:00<?, ?it/s]W0512 21:38:05.045000 393 torch/_inductor/utils.py:1137] [1/0] Not enough SMs to use max_autotune_gemm mode\n","100%|██████████| 800/800 [3:13:41<00:00, 14.53s/it]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#df[\"max_embedding\"] = df[\"max_embedding\"].apply(lambda x: x.tolist() if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) else x)\n","df[\"mean_embedding\"] = df[\"mean_embedding\"].apply(lambda x: x.tolist() if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) else x)\n","\n","df.to_json('/content/drive/MyDrive/metadata/embeddings/val_embeddings.json')"],"metadata":{"id":"3sBYm3sR3b8L","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747097496846,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":620,"user":{"displayName":"Rachel Gao","userId":"10157902458628963651"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"ZQcgupWJWNzl","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":328},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747097498973,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2133,"user":{"displayName":"Rachel Gao","userId":"10157902458628963651"}},"outputId":"6695c685-086b-4726-ba68-8ebe6968ae6c"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   case_id                                      clean_content  \\\n","0        3  The case \"David B. v.

As litigants raising\\nthese constitutional issues, Plaintiffs were required by Illinois Supreme Court Rule 19 to serve notice\\nof their Complaint on Attorney General.  To Defendant\\u2019s knowledge, Plaintiffs have not done so to\\ndate.  A copy of Defendant\\u2019s February 13, 2007 letter notice to the Illinois Attorney General\\nproviding the requisite Rule 19 notice is attached as Exhibit A to this motion.\\nA. In support of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, Defendant states as follows:\\n1. This action was commenced in the Circuit Court for the Tenth Judicial Circuit,\\nPutnam County, Illinois on December 20, 2006.  Plaintiffs\\u2019 Complaint asserts that the method\\nprescribed by state law for electing members of Defendant\\u2019s Board of Education has deprived them\\nof equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\\nConstitution.\\nThe Complaint also asserts that the Illinois School Code provisions in question violate Article III,\\nSection 3 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, which states that \\u201c[a]ll elections shall be free and equal.\\u201d\\n   2.  Defendant removed the action to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1441(b) and 1446\\non January 12, 2007.  Subject matter jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1331 in light of the\\nfederal questions presented, and under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1367(a) with respect to the related state claims.\\n3.  The Complaint alleges that pertinent parts of Article 9 of the Illinois School Code \\u2013 and\\nin particular, the section thereof which provides that all voters in certain multi-township school\\ndistricts shall elect all seven members of the board of education, but restricts the membership of the\\nboard to a maximum of three members residing in any single township \\u2013 violates the principle of\\n\\u201cone person, one vote\\u201d as applied to Plaintiffs and other residents of Township 32N, R1W, pleaded\\n\\u2013 2 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 3 of 13 \\nto be the majority population township in Defendant District 535.  See Complaint paragraphs 9\\nthrough 12.  (Although not specifically cited by Plaintiffs in their Complaint, this provision is found\\nin \\u00a7 9-12 of the School Code at 105 ILCS 5/9-12 and more specifically, in Ballot Format 4 set out\\ntherein and applicable to District 535.) \\n4.  The Complaint also alleges that this law unconstitutionally crimps the opportunity of\\nwould-be candidates residing in the majority population township to be elected to the school board.\\n5.  Plaintiffs\\u2019 Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to\\nstate any claim on which relief can be granted, in that controlling case law refutes both of the above\\npropositions.\\n6.  \\u201c[A]s a general rule, whenever a state or local government decides to elect persons by\\npopular election to perform governmental functions,  the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\\nAmendment requires that each qualified voter must be given an equal opportunity to participate in\\nthe election, and when members of an elected body are chosen from separate districts, each district\\nmust be established on a basis that will ensure, as far as practicable, that equal numbers of voters can\\nvote for proportionally equal numbers of officials.\\u201d  Hadley v. Junior Coll. Dist., 397 U.S. 50, 56,\\n90 S.Ct. 791, 795 (1970) (emphasis added) (holding that the \\u201cone man, one vote\\u201d principle applied\\nto the election of the defendant college district\\u2019s trustees).\\n    7.  However, as the Hadley Court went on to state, this holding did not inhibit states from\\nfinding ways to ensure that legitimate political goals of representation are achieved. \\u201cWe have\\npreviously upheld against constitutional challenge an election scheme that required that candidates\\nbe residents of certain districts that did not contain equal numbers of people.  Dusch v. Davis, 387\\n\\u2013 3 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 4 of 13 \\nU.S. 112, 87 S.Ct. 1554 (1967).  Since all the officials in that case were elected at large, the right of\\neach voter was given equal treatment.\\u201d  Hadley, 397 U.S. at 58,  90 S.Ct. at 796.\\n8.  Dusch v. Davis disposes of Plaintiffs\\u2019 one person, one vote argument in this case.  In\\nDusch, the Court rejected an Equal Protection Clause challenge to a so-called \\u201cSeven-Four Plan\\u201d for\\nelecting members of the Virginia Beach City Council.  Under that plan, each of the 11 council\\nmembers was elected by a vote of all the electors in the City.  Four members were elected at large\\nwithout regard to residence.   Each of the remaining seven council members had to reside in the\\nborough from which he or she was elected.\\n9.   Delivering the opinion of the Dusch Court, Justice Douglas explained why this residence\\nrequirement was constitutionally unobjectionable: \\u201cIn upholding a residence requirement for the\\nelection of state senators from a multi-district county we said in Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433,\\n85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 201:  \\u2018 It is not accurate to treat a senator from a multi-district county\\nas the representative of only that district within the county wherein he resides.  The statute uses\\ndistricts in multi-district counties merely as the basis of residence for candidates, not for voting or\\nrepresentation.  Each district\\u2019s senator must be a resident of that district, but since his tenure depends\\nupon the county-wide electorate he must be vigilant to serve the interests of all the people in the\\ncounty, and not merely those of people in this home district; thus in fact he is the county\\u2019s and not\\nmerely the district\\u2019s senator.\\u2019\\u201d  Dusch v. Davis, 387 U.S. at 115, 87 S.Ct. at 1555-56.\\n10.  Likewise in this case, it is not accurate to treat a school board member elected by all the\\nvoters of a district of multiple congressional townships, as the representative of only that township\\nin which the board member resides.  Each school board member must be attentive to the needs and\\ninterests of the entire district electorate which votes the board member into (or out of) office.\\n\\u2013 4 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 5 of 13 \\n11.  Plaintiffs\\u2019 claim that the School Code provisions at issue violate their Fourteenth\\nAmendment rights as voters fails to state a claim, in light of the Supreme Court\\u2019s decision in Dusch\\nv. Davis, handed down nearly 40 years ago and cited and followed in many lower court cases.  See,\\ne.g., La Port County Republic Cent. Comm., 43 F.3d 1126, 1129 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding that\\nresidence districts need not have identical \\u201cor even similar\\u201d populations because voters may cast\\nballots for each of three county board positions, and affirming dismissal of suit on the pleadings);\\nHurlbut v. Scheetz, 804 F.2d 462 (8th Cir. 1986) (approving election system requiring at-large voting\\nin school board elections in sparsely populated North Dakota district, including restriction that\\nballots group candidates by residence and that one candidate be elected from each of five geographic\\nareas:  \\u201c[p]reserving distinct viewpoints of scattered geographical areas within a single governmental\\nentity has been recognized by the Supreme Court [in Dusch] as a sufficient justification for use of\\ngeographic residency requirements in conjunction with an at an-large voting scheme\\u201d);  Jt. Sch. Dist.\\nNo. 2 v. State Appeal Bd., 83 Wis.2d 711, 726, 266 N.W.2d 375, 381-82 (S.Ct. Wis. 1978) (electing\\none board member from each of nine former elementary school districts,  reorganized with a union\\nhigh school into a K-12 district, did not unconstitutionally \\u201cdilute\\u201d votes of residents in more\\npopulous districts: under Dusch, voting districts of unequal population are permissible if board is\\nelected at large and member of board represents the entire district);  Goldblatt v. City of Dallas, 414\\nF.2d 774, 775-76 (1969) (\\u201cappellant wisely does not contend that the Dallas \\u2018six-three\\u2019 city council\\nelection structure is unconstitutional per se\\u201d, the Supreme Court having specifically approved an\\nanalogous plan in Dusch: the one man-one vote principle is automatically complied with because\\nall votes are equal in a city-wide election).\\n\\u2013 5 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 6 of 13 \\n12.  Plaintiffs also assert that the residency restrictions in the challenged School Code\\nprovisions violate their Fourteenth Amendment rights as would-be candidates for the Board of\\nEducation.  They contend the law is fatally flawed in that, as pleaded in paragraph 10 of the\\nComplaint, it \\u201cprohibits plaintiffs and other similarly situated residents of Township 32N, R1W\\n...from being elected to said board despite having received more votes than residents of other\\ntownships in said District\\u201d.\\n13.   This assertion, too, fails to state a claim and should be dismissed pursuant to F.R.Civ.P.\\n12(b)(6).  Under the case law cited above, and to paraphrase Goldblatt v. City of Dallas, 414 F.2d\\nat 776, the possibility that a particular resident candidate wins in his township but loses district-wide\\ndoes not amount to discrimination against either the candidate or against the voters of that township:\\n\\u201cThe election is [district]-wide, and the elected official is a representative of the entire [district], not\\nmerely of a particular [township].\\u201d\\n14.  Even if the residency requirement were to be viewed as a species of ballot access\\nrestriction  \\u2013  which it is not, there being no limit to the number of Township 32N, R1W residents\\nwho may vie for such of the total three school board seats \\u201creserved\\u201d for them as may be open in any\\ngiven school board election \\u2013 the State\\u2019s interest in fostering geographic diversity on school boards\\nof large, multi-township districts is sufficient to justify the calibrated limitations reflected in the\\nprovisions of School Code \\u00a7 9-12.   \\n15.  Courts evaluate ballot access restrictions under a flexible standard that weighs the\\n\\u201c\\u2018character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth\\nAmendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate\\u2019 against \\u2018the precise interests put forward by the\\nState as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,\\u2019 taking into consideration \\u2018the extent to\\n\\u2013 6 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 7 of 13 \\nwhich those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff\\u2019s rights.\\u2019\\u201d  Lee v. Keith, 463 F.3d 763,\\n768  (7th Cir. 2006), quoting Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059 (1992), quoting\\nin turn Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 at 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564 (1983).   \\u201cUnder this standard,\\nthe rigorousness of...inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to\\nwhich a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\\u201d  Burdick, 504 U.S.\\nat 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059.  Restrictions that severely burden the exercise of constitutional rights must\\nbe narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance (such as education, see\\nFumarolo v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 142 Ill.2d 54, 566 N.E.2d 1283, 1299 (1990)), whereas\\n\\u201creasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\\u201d that impose less substantial burdens are generally\\njustified by the state\\u2019s \\u201cimportant regulatory interests\\u201d.  Id.    \\n16.  Unlike Illinois\\u2019 demanding ballot access rules struck down in Lee v. Keith, which in\\ncombination made it well-nigh impossible for independent candidates to run for election to the State\\nlegislature,  the electoral method objected to by Plaintiffs in this case does not severely burden, let\\nalone have the effect of \\u201cthoroughly excluding\\u201d (cf. Lee, 463 F.3d at 769) candidates from the\\nmajority population township entering a school board race.  Far from it:  three of the seven school\\nboard members may be elected from a candidate pool supplied by residents of Township 32N, R1W.\\n17.  Moreover, and as highlighted below, School Code \\u00a7 9-12 read as a whole is carefully\\ncalibrated to serve Illinois\\u2019 important \\u2013 if not compelling \\u2013  interest in bringing about, under\\npolitically palatable conditions, the consolidation of the State\\u2019s smaller school systems into unit\\nschool districts to more efficiently and cost-effectively secure public education of good quality for\\nstudents in grades K through 12. \\n\\u2013 7 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 8 of 13 \\n   18.  District 535's Board of Education is currently elected using the \\u201cFormat 4\\\" Official\\nBallot prescribed by School Code \\u00a7 9-12, which applies (insofar as pertinent for present purposes)\\nto community unit school districts formed prior to January 1, 1975 when the territory of the school\\ndistrict is greater than two congressional townships, or 72 square miles, except for those community\\nunit school districts formed prior to January 1, 1975 that only elect board members at large and\\nwithout restriction by area of residence within the district.  As District 535 does not fall within the\\nlatter excepted category,  its school board elections use the Format 4 ballot,  which provides that \\u201cnot\\nmore than 3 board members may be selected from any one congressional township\\u201d, and which\\napplies \\u201conly when less than 75% of the population. is in one congressional township\\u201d.  105 ILCS\\n5/9-12 \\u201cFORMAT 4\\u201d.1\\n19.   If and when at least 75% but less than 90% of the population of such a district resides\\nin one congressional township, then the number of school board members to be selected from that\\none township increases to four, and the remaining three board members are selected from the district\\n1  Plaintiffs plead the facts which illustrate the applicability of Format 4 only obliquely, in Complaint paragraph\\n10 which asserts, \\u201cUnder the provisions of 105 ILCS 5/11A-8, succeeded by 105 ILCS 5/9, only three of the\\nseven members of the Board of Education of Putnam Community Unit School District # 535 may reside in\\nTownship 32 N R1W of the 3rd Principal Meridian, notwithstanding the fact that a majority of the residents of\\nsaid District reside in said township.\\u201d  (Emphasis added). \\nReferenced \\u00a7 11A-8 of the School Code (105 ILCS 5/11A-8) described the requirements for passage of\\nreferenda  to  create  a  community  unit  school  district  and,  in  the  cases  of  community  unit  districts\\nencompassing more than two congressional townships or 72 square miles, prescribed the geographic\\nrepresentation requirements calibrated to population which are contained in the Official Ballot Formats set out\\nin School Code \\u00a7 9-12, reviewed above.

Plaintiffs are not entitled to such extraordinary equitable relief, nor to any relief at all.\\n The automatic adjustments of school board electoral mechanisms built into School Code \\u00a7 9-12\\nrepresent exactly the type of narrow tailoring  courts look for, in evaluating whether a ballot access\\nrestriction exceeds what is needed to serve a compelling state interest in situations where election\\nlaw restrictions impose a \\u201csevere\\u201d burden on rights of potential candidates. \\n22.  But again, School Code \\u00a7 9-12's election provisions do not place a \\u201csevere\\u201d burden on\\nprospective school board candidates from majority population townships, and find explicit sanction\\nin the U.S. Supreme Court\\u2019s decisions in Dusch and Hadley.   Any judicial evaluation of the election\\nprovisions  in  \\u00a7  9-12  must  proceed  under  the  standard  which  applies  to  \\u201creasonable\\nnondiscriminatory restrictions\\u201d which impose modest \\u201cburdens\\u201d to serve important State regulatory\\ninterests, see Lee v. Keith, above.  The provisions of the School Code challenged by Plaintiffs readily\\nsatisfy that standard.\\n\\u2013 9 \\u2013\\n\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 10 of 13 \\n23.  Last but not least,  the de minimus and constitutionally permissible \\u201cburdens\\u201d assertedly\\nimposed by School Code \\u00a7 9-12's applicable provisions are further alleviated by the fact that School\\nCode \\u00a7 9-22 provides a method by which Plaintiffs and their fellow electors / would-be candidates\\nresident in Township 32N, R1W can initiate a referendum on the proposition of electing school\\nboard members by school board districts if they deem that system preferable, instead of district-wide\\nas is presently done. \\n24.  Section 9-22 authorizes such a referendum if initiated by the board of education, or on\\npetition of the lesser of 2,500 or 5% of registered voters of the district.  The proposition passes if a\\nsimple majority of voters, district-wide, approves it.  Thus, if District 535 voters in Township 32N\\nR1W want to eliminate the alleged unequal burdening of their rights as candidates by adopting an\\nelection-by-district system, then as the most populous group of electors in the district they have\\nample political power to attain this fully adequate remedy at law.\\n25.  Dismissal of Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims insofar as they are founded on the \\u201cfree and fair elections\\u201d\\nprovisions of the Article III, Section 3 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution is also warranted.  The\\nIllinois Supreme Court has equated the Illinois Constitution\\u2019s guarantee of \\u201cequal protection of the\\nlaws\\u201d, and the \\u201cfree and equal\\u201d requirements of Article III, Section 3, with protections afforded by\\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stating that no precedent suggests that\\nthe Illinois Constitution calls for more than the Federal Constitution in relation to equal protection\\nsafeguards.

Because Plaintiffs\\u2019 action contests the validity of Defendant\\u2019s Board of Education as\\nelected pursuant to the challenged statutes, and the right of current Board members to hold their\\noffices, it critically affects not only Putnam County Community Unit School District No. 235 but\\nother Illinois school districts in which elections are subject to the mandatory board representation\\nprovisions of School Code \\u00a7 9-12.   \\n3.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (\\u201cBOP\\u201d) has established two separate systems to \\ncalculate its residents\\u2019 \\u201ccriminal history scores,\\u201d a number that is used to determine Plaintiffs\\u2019 \\nsecurity classification, i.e. the security level of the prisons in which Plaintiffs are placed, and their \\neligibility for home confinement and release to a halfway house. \\n2.  These  two,  separate  criminal  history  scoring  systems  apply  arbitrarily  and \\nunequally to BOP residents based on the court from which they were sentenced \\u2014 federal district \\ncourts or another court system, such as the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, other state \\ncourts, or military tribunals.  This action specifically challenges the application of a different \\ncriminal history scoring rule to the group of individuals that are sentenced by the Superior Court \\nfor the District of Columbia and transferred to BOP custody to serve their sentences, i.e. Plaintiffs \\nand proposed class. \\n3.  The first system \\u2014 which is based on Chapter 4 of the United States Sentencing \\nGuidelines\\u2019 calculation of criminal history points \\u2014 applies to the vast majority of BOP residents \\nwho were sentenced by a federal district court and who enter the BOP with a commitment order, \\na statement of reasons, and/or a presentence report that lists their Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\nhistory points.  For these residents, the BOP simply relies upon their Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 \\ncriminal history points to determine their criminal history score. \\n4.  The second system applies to the small minority of BOP residents who do not enter \\nthe BOP with a Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal history points calculation, including individuals \\nwho were sentenced by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, other state courts, or \\nmilitary tribunals.  See U.S. DEP\\u2019T OF JUSTICE, FED. BUREAU OF PRISONS, PROGRAM STATEMENT \\n  2 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 3 of 33\\n5100.08: INMATE SECURITY DESIGNATION & CUSTODY CLASSIFICATION (\\u201cPS 5100.08\\u201d) 33 (2006).  \\nFor  those  residents,  including  Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members,  the  BOP\\u2019s  Program \\nStatement 5100.08 applies a separate scoring system to tabulate their criminal history points and \\nthen converts those points into a criminal history score. \\n5.  In the overwhelming number of cases, people subject to the second system receive \\nhigher criminal history scores than people subject to the first system.  In other words, the BOP\\u2019s \\nProgram Statement 5100.08 yields more criminal history points \\u2014 and a higher criminal history \\nscore \\u2014 than the criminal history points calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines for similarly \\nsituated incarcerated people. \\n6.  Because the criminal history score is the most significant factor in determining \\nsomeone\\u2019s security classification, individuals with higher criminal history scores are more likely \\nto be incarcerated in a high security facility.  As a result of BOP\\u2019s arbitrary and unequal criminal \\nhistory scoring system, Plaintiffs and proposed class members are more likely to be incarcerated \\nin high security BOP facilities, where they are subjected to greater violence and offered fewer \\nprogramming opportunities, and they are denied opportunities to seek release to home confinement \\nthat might otherwise be available to them. \\n7.  Empirical evidence bears this unequal treatment out.  Twelve percent of BOP \\nresidents overall are incarcerated in high security institutions, whereas 39 percent of \\u201cD.C. Code \\noffenders\\u201d are housed in those institutions.  See COUNCIL FOR COURT EXCELLENCE, ANALYSIS OF \\nBOP DATA SNAPSHOT FROM JULY 4, 2020 FOR THE DISTRICT TASK FORCE ON JAILS AND JUSTICE 4 \\n(2020),  http://www.courtexcellence.org/uploads/publications/Analysis_of_BOP_Data_Snapshot \\n_from_7420.pdf.  Plaintiffs and proposed class members  are three times more likely to be \\n  3 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 4 of 33\\nincarcerated in a high security penitentiary than other BOP residents and could be systematically \\nexcluded from seeking release to home confinement. \\n8.  The  BOP\\u2019s  separate  scoring  system  also  disproportionately  affects  its  Black \\nresidents as 95.6 percent of people who are sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court and who are in \\nBOP custody are Black.  See COUNCIL FOR COURT EXCELLENCE, ANALYSIS OF BOP DATA \\nSNAPSHOT FROM JULY 4, 2020 FOR THE DISTRICT TASK FORCE ON JAILS AND JUSTICE 2 (2020), \\nhttp://www.courtexcellence.org/uploads/publications/Analysis_of_BOP_Data_Snapshot_from_7\\n420.pdf.  By contrast, the majority of individuals sentenced by federal district courts are white.  \\nThe BOP tracks the racial composition of individuals in its custody and at individual facilities and \\nis aware of the racial differences between the two populations.  Applying a harsher criminal history \\nscoring system to the majority-Black population of individuals sentenced by the Superior Court \\nfor the District of Columbia puts them at a significant disadvantage to their majority-white federal \\ncounterparts.  This is doubly concerning because the BOP\\u2019s own regulations make clear that \\u201cstaff \\nshall not discriminate against inmates on the basis of race * * * [in] providing access to work, \\nhousing and programs.\\u201d  28 C.F.R. \\u00a7 551.90. \\n9.  The BOP\\u2019s two-tiered system for calculating criminal history scores is arbitrary, \\ncapricious, and contrary to law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 501 \\net seq., and unconstitutional in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment, \\nU.S. Cons. amend. V.  \\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \\n10.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\nSection 1331 because it arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States. \\n  4 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 5 of 33\\n11.  Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 2201 and 2202, by 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 702, by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and 65, and by the \\ninherent equitable powers of this Court. \\n12.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1391(e)(1) because a substantial \\npart of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred, and continue to occur, in this \\nDistrict. \\nPARTIES \\n13.  Plaintiff Jonathan Blades was convicted of D.C. Code offenses and is serving his \\nsentence in the Bureau of Prisons.  Mr. Blades is Black and currently incarcerated at United States \\nPenitentiary (USP) Pollock, a high security penitentiary located in Pollock, Louisiana.   \\n14.  Mr.  Blades\\u2019  criminal  history  points  were  assessed  under  Program  Statement \\n5100.08, and not the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, because Mr. Blades was sentenced in the \\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia and is serving his sentence in BOP custody.  \\n15.  If Mr. Blades\\u2019 criminal history points were scored under the Sentencing Guidelines, \\nhis criminal history points would be lower than they currently are because the Sentencing \\nGuidelines would not award points for his juvenile probationary sentences or for his 2002 adult \\nprobationary sentences that occurred more than 10 years prior to the instant offense. \\n16.  Plaintiff Antwan Buchanan was convicted of D.C. Code offenses and is serving his \\nsentence in the Bureau of Prisons.  Mr. Buchanan is Black and is currently incarcerated at USP \\nBig Sandy, a high security penitentiary located in Inez, Kentucky. \\n17.  Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s criminal history points were assessed under Program Statement \\n5100.08, and not the Sentencing Guidelines, because Mr. Buchanan was sentenced in the Superior \\nCourt of the District of Columbia and is serving his sentence in BOP custody.  \\n  5 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 6 of 33\\n18.  If  Mr.  Buchanan\\u2019s  criminal  history  points  were  scored  under  the  Sentencing \\nGuidelines, his criminal history points would be lower than they currently are because the \\nSentencing Guidelines would not count a 2002 conviction and a 2004 conviction and he would \\nreceive fewer criminal history points for his 2006 and 2008 convictions. \\n19.  Defendant Michael Carvajal is sued in his official capacity as Director, Federal Bureau \\nof Prisons.  In this capacity, Defendant Carvajal oversees the operations of the Federal Bureau of \\nPrisons. \\nBACKGROUND \\n20.  Congress requires the Bureau of Prisons to consider \\u201cthe history and characteristics \\nof the prisoner\\u201d as well as a \\u201cprisoner\\u2019s security designation\\u201d when designating prisoners to \\ncorrectional facilities.  18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 3621(b). \\n21.  Pursuant to that statutory requirement, the BOP issued Program Statement 5100.08 \\nin 2006, outlining how the BOP would weigh those factors when designating individuals to prisons \\nacross the country.   \\n22.  BOP institutions fall into \\u201cfive security levels\\u201d: \\u201cMINIMUM, LOW, MEDIUM, \\nHIGH, and ADMINISTRATIVE.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 7. \\n23.  To designate prisoners into one of those five security levels of institutions, the BOP \\nrelies on a set of inputs to \\u201ccalculate[] a [security] point score for [an] inmate which * * * is then \\nmatched with a commensurate security level institution.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 8.  \\n24.  Subject to certain caveats, an individual with a security point score between 0 and \\n11 security points is matched to a minimum security facility, between 12 and 15 security points to \\na low security facility, between 16 and 23 security points to a medium security facility, and 24 and \\nover security points to a high security facility.  See PS 5100.08 at 8. \\n  6 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 7 of 33\\n25.  The BOP relies on a set of established factors to determine the security point score, \\nincluding \\u201cvoluntary surrender,\\u201d the \\u201cseverity of current offense,\\u201d \\u201chistory of violence,\\u201d \\u201chistory \\nof escape or attempts,\\u201d \\u201ctype of detainer,\\u201d \\u201cage,\\u201d \\u201ceducation level,\\u201d \\u201cdrug and alcohol abuse,\\u201d and \\n\\u201ccriminal history score.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 30\\u201338.  To calculate the total security point score, the \\nBOP adds up the points assigned to each of these criteria.  Id. at 41.  \\n26.  The BOP explains in Program Statement 5100.08 that the \\u201ccriminal history score\\u201d \\nis \\u201cone of the factors used to calculate the inmate\\u2019s security point total.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 10.  \\n27.  The criminal history score is one of the most influential categories in determining \\nthe total security point total.  For example, while the \\u201cseverity of current offense\\u201d category can \\nincrease the security point by a maximum of seven points for the \\u201cgreatest\\u201d severity offense, the \\ncriminal history score can increase the security point score by ten points \\u2014 a difference large \\nenough on its own to move a prisoner from a low security facility to a high security facility.  See \\nPS 5100.08 at 8, 32\\u201333. \\n28.  Program Statement 5100.08 establishes two systems for deriving criminal history \\nscores. \\n29.  The vast majority of prisoners in BOP custody are convicted of federal offenses \\nand sentenced by federal district courts.  For those individuals \\u2014 referred to here as \\u201cindividuals \\nwith federal sentences\\u201d \\u2014 their \\u201c[criminal history score] is derived from the US Sentencing \\nGuidelines Criminal History Points, as reflected in the final judgment and the [statement of \\nreasons].  If not found in either the Judgment or [statement of reasons],\\u201d the BOP \\u201cuse[s] the points \\nassessed by the [United States Probation Office] in the [Presentence Report].\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n  7 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 8 of 33\\n30.  The BOP converts the Sentencing Guidelines criminal history points into a criminal \\nhistory score using the conversion table depicted below.  That criminal history score is then used \\nto determine the security point score.   \\nCriminal History Points  Criminal History Score \\n0 to 1 point  0 \\n2 to 3 points  2 \\n4 to 6 points  4 \\n7 to 9 points  6 \\n10 to 12 points  8 \\n13 or more points  10 \\n \\nPS 5100.08 at 33.  For instance, based on the table above, a person with five criminal history points \\nreceives a criminal history score of four.  See PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\n31.  For individuals in BOP custody who are sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court1 \\u2014 \\nreferred to here as \\u201cindividuals with D.C. sentences\\u201d \\u2014 the BOP applies a different rule set forth \\nin Program Statement 5100.08 to calculate their criminal history points, which is then converted \\nto a criminal history score pursuant to the conversion table in Paragraph 30.  See PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n32.  Unlike individuals with federal sentences, individuals with D.C. sentences do not \\nenter the BOP with \\u201cUS Sentencing Guidelines Criminal History Points\\u201d that are \\u201creflected in the \\nfinal judgment,\\u201d a judicial statement of reasons, or a Presentence Report.  PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n                                                 \\n1 Pursuant to the Revitalization Act, nearly all individuals sentenced to felonies by the D.C. \\nSuperior Court are immediately transferred to BOP custody to serve out their sentences.  For that \\nreason, individuals with D.C. Code convictions comprise the bulk of individuals affected by the \\nBOP\\u2019s rudimentary and arbitrary scoring scheme.  Because this lawsuit focuses on the unfair \\ntreatment of individuals with D.C. Code convictions, only that group will be referenced throughout \\nthe motion.  It is worth noting, however, that the criminal history scoring of individuals serving \\nother state or military tribunal sentences is equally unfair and arbitrary for the same reasons. \\n  8 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 9 of 33\\n33.  Program  Statement  5100.08\\u2019s  rule  for  calculating  criminal  history  points  for \\nindividuals with D.C. sentences is materially different than the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\nhistory points calculation that the BOP relies on for individuals with federal sentences.   \\n34.  Under Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s rule for individuals with D.C. sentences, the \\nBOP does not rely on any previous calculation of criminal history points and undertakes the \\ncalculation itself after obtaining an \\u201cNCIC III Report,\\u201d a criminal history report derived from the \\nNational Crime Information Center database maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  \\nPS 5100.08 at 33. \\n35.  After obtaining the NCIC III Report, Program Statement 5100.08 instructs the BOP \\nto calculate the criminal history points for individuals with D.C. sentences as follows: \\na. Add 3 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one \\nyear and one month; \\nb. Add 2 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least \\nsixty days not counted in (a); \\nc. Add 1 point for each prior conviction not counted in (a) or (b), up to \\na total of 4 points for this item; and, \\nd. Add 2 points if the instant offense is a revocation accompanied by a \\nnew state or federal conviction, or if the instant offense occurred \\nwhile under federal supervision including incarceration, probation, \\nparole or supervised release. \\n \\nPS 5100.08 at 33. \\n \\n36.  The BOP\\u2019s calculation of criminal history points under Program Statement 5100.08 \\nis then converted to a criminal history score based on the table depicted in Paragraph 30.  \\n37.  The system the BOP uses to calculate criminal history points for individuals with \\nD.C. sentences results in systematically higher criminal history scores than their similarly situated \\nfederal counterparts.  This leads to higher, more restrictive security designations for individuals \\nwith D.C. sentences as compared to individuals with federal sentences that have identical criminal \\nhistories. \\n  9 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 10 of 33\\n38.  The Sentencing Guidelines generally does not award criminal history points for the \\nfollowing categories of offenses and sentences whereas the BOP\\u2019s scoring rule contains no such \\nexceptions or limitations:  \\na.  Stale offenses and sentences \\nb.  Petty offenses \\nc.  Juvenile offenses \\nd.  Suspended sentences \\ne.  Multiple sentences for offenses in the same charging instrument or that were \\nsentenced on the same day \\n \\nStale offenses and sentences \\n \\n39.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards three points for a \\u201cprior sentence of \\nimprisonment exceeding one year and one month\\u201d that was \\u201cimposed within fifteen years of the \\ndefendant\\u2019s  commencement  of  the  instant  offense.\\u201d  United  States  Sentencing  Commission, \\nGuidelines Manual, \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(a), 4A1.2(e)(1) (emphasis added).  This includes any sentence \\n\\u201cexceeding one year and one month, whenever imposed, that resulted in the [individual] being \\nincarcerated during any part of such fifteen-year period.\\u201d  Id. \\n40.  In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards three points for \\n\\u201ceach prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month\\u201d regardless of when that \\nsentence was imposed, PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n41.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards two points for \\u201ceach prior sentence of \\nimprisonment of at least sixty days not counted in [\\u00a74A1.1(a)],\\u201d USSG \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(b), only if that \\nsentence \\u201cwas imposed within ten years of the defendant\\u2019s commencement of the instant offense,\\u201d \\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2) (emphasis added). \\n42.  In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards two points \\u201cfor \\neach prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days [but not greater than one year and one \\nmonth],\\u201d regardless of when that sentence was imposed.  PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n  10 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 11 of 33\\n43.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards one point for \\u201cfor each prior sentence not \\ncounted in [\\u00a7 4A1.1](a) or [\\u00a7 4A1.1](b), up to a total of 4 points,\\u201d USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(c), only if that \\nsentence \\u201cwas imposed within ten years of the defendant's commencement of the instant offense,\\u201d  \\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). \\n44.  In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards one point \\u201cfor \\neach prior conviction not [previously] counted * * * up to a total of 4 points for this item,\\u201d \\nregardless of when that sentence was imposed.  PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\n45.  Consider an individual with a D.C. sentence who committed their \\u201cinstant offense\\u201d \\non January 1, 2015 and had the following criminal history: \\na.  Two-year prison sentence imposed on January 1, 1980 \\nb.  Six-month prison sentence imposed on January 1, 1984 \\nc.  Three-month probationary sentence imposed on January 1, 1986 \\n \\nUnder the BOP\\u2019s rule, that person would receive a total of six criminal history points (three points \\nfor the 1980 sentence, two points for the 1984 sentence, and one point for the 1986 sentence) for \\na criminal history score of four.  See PS 5100.08 at 33; supra \\u00b6 35.  \\n46.  A  similarly  situated  individual  with  a  federal  sentence  who  had  an  identical \\ncriminal history and an identical instant offense would receive zero criminal history points \\u2014 a \\ncriminal history score of zero \\u2014 because each of the three sentences imposed would be considered \\nstale and not count under the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal history points calculation. \\n47.  Because Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s rule does not contain a staleness exception \\nfor individuals with D.C. sentences, unlike the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 points calculation for \\nindividuals with federal sentences, the BOP\\u2019s rule systematically results in higher criminal history \\npoints and higher criminal history scores for Plaintiff and proposed class members, as compared \\nto similarly situated individuals with federal sentences.   \\n  11 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 12 of 33\\nPetty offenses \\n48.  The Sentencing Guidelines also limit the types of offenses for which criminal \\nhistory points are awarded.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c). \\n49.  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, certain \\u201cprior offenses and offenses similar to \\nthem,\\u201d including \\u201c[p]ublic intoxication,\\u201d \\u201c[l]oitering,\\u201d and \\u201c[v]agrancy,\\u201d are \\u201cnever counted\\u201d in a \\ncriminal history score.  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2). \\n50.  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, other \\u201cprior offenses and offenses similar to \\nthem,\\u201d  including  \\u201creckless  driving,\\u201d  \\u201c[t]respassing,\\u201d  \\u201c[c]ontempt  of  court,\\u201d  or  \\u201c[d]isorderly \\nconduct,\\u201d are \\u201ccounted only if (A) the sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or \\na term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an instant \\noffense.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). \\n51.  In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards criminal history \\npoints regardless of type of prior offense.  See PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n52.  For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a prior public intoxication \\noffense would receive criminal history points where as an individual with a federal sentence with \\na similar prior conviction would not. \\n53.  Likewise, an individual with a D.C. sentence with an instant drug sale offense and \\na prior conviction for driving without a license offense for which they received a sentence of 10 \\ndays of imprisonment would receive criminal history points, and potentially a higher criminal \\nhistory score, that a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence would not. \\n54.  As a result of this material difference in treatment of prior offenses, individuals \\nwith D.C. sentences systematically receive higher criminal history points, and therefore higher \\n  12 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 13 of 33\\ncriminal  history  scores,  as  compared  to  similarly  situated  federal  counterparts. \\nJuvenile offenses \\n55.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines limit the awarding of criminal history points for \\nprior offenses committed as a juvenile.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c).  \\n56.  The  Sentencing  Guidelines  award  two  criminal  history  points  for  each  prior \\njuvenile offense that resulted in \\u201cconfinement of at least sixty days\\u201d only when \\u201cthe defendant was \\nreleased from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense.\\u201d \\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(A). \\n57.  The Sentencing Guidelines award one criminal history point for each prior juvenile \\noffense that did not result in confinement of at least sixty days only if the \\u201csentence [was] imposed \\nwithin  five  years  of  the  defendant\\u2019s  commencement  of  the  instant  offense.\\u201d  USSG \\n\\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(B). \\n58.  While the Sentencing Guidelines award criminal history points only for juvenile \\noffenses imposed within a limited period of time, the BOP awards criminal history points for all \\njuvenile offenses without any limitations, see PS 5100.08 at 33.   \\n59.  For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a 1995 juvenile sentence that \\nresulted in ninety days\\u2019 imprisonment will receive two criminal history points, and a higher \\ncriminal history score, than a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence.  \\n60.  As a result of this material difference in treatment of juvenile offenses, individuals \\nwith D.C. sentences systematically receive higher criminal history points, and potentially higher \\ncriminal history scores, as compared to similarly situated federal counterparts. \\n \\n \\n  13 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 14 of 33\\nSuspended sentences \\n61.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines award three, two, or one criminal history points \\nfor each prior conviction depending on the length of sentence for those convictions.  See USSG \\n\\u00a7 4A1.1(a)-(c). \\n62.  To determine the length of sentence for prior convictions where \\u201cpart of a sentence \\nof imprisonment was suspended,\\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines consider only \\u201cthe portion that was \\nnot suspended.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(b)(2).  \\n63.  Like the Sentencing Guidelines, for individuals with D.C. sentences, Program \\nStatement 5100.08 also awards three, two, or one criminal history points for each prior conviction \\ndepending on the length of sentence for those prior convictions.  See PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n64.  Unlike the Sentencing Guidelines, the BOP considers the total length of sentence \\nof those prior convictions regardless of whether a portion of that sentence was suspended.  See PS \\n5100.08 at 33. \\n65.  For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a prior sentence of two years\\u2019 \\nimprisonment, suspended as to all but two months, would receive three criminal history points \\nunder Program Statement 5100.08.  By contrast, an individual with a federal sentence with the \\nsame prior sentence would receive only one criminal history point, and only if that prior conviction \\nwas an applicable offense and did not fall within the staleness exception.  \\n66.  As a result of this material difference in the treatment of suspended sentences, \\nindividuals  with  D.C.  sentences  systematically  receive  higher  criminal  history  points,  and \\ntherefore higher criminal history scores, as compared to similarly situated federal counterparts. \\n \\n \\n  14 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 15 of 33\\nMultiple sentences for offenses in the same charging instrument or that were sentenced on \\nthe same day \\n \\n67.  The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines treat certain prior sentences as a single sentence.  \\n68.  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, prior sentences that were not separated by an \\nintervening arrest are counted as one sentence for purposes of calculating criminal history points \\nif they \\u201cresulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument\\u201d or if \\u201cthe sentences \\nwere imposed on the same day.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). \\n69.  By contrast, Program Statement 5100.08 treats all prior sentences as separate \\nsentences for purposes of calculating criminal history points. \\n70.  For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence who previously received two \\nconcurrent sentences of 24 months\\u2019 imprisonment for two counts of possession of cocaine charged \\nin the same indictment would receive six criminal history points under Program Statement 5100.08 \\nbecause each sentence of 24 months would count as three points.  See PS 5100.08 at 33.  By \\ncontrast, a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence would only receive three criminal \\nhistory points under the same scenario because the Sentencing Guidelines would treat the two \\nconcurrent 24-month sentences as a sentence that \\u201cresulted from offenses contained in the same \\ncharging instrument.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). \\n71.  As a result of this material difference in treatment of sentences contained in the \\nsame  charging  instrument  or  charged  on  the  same  day,  individuals  with  D.C.  sentences \\nsystematically receive higher criminal history points, and therefore higher criminal history scores, \\nas compared to their similarly situated federal counterparts. \\n72.  In addition to greatly determining security designations, the BOP\\u2019s criminal history \\nscore also plays a significant role in determining a prisoner\\u2019s PATTERN risk assessment score. \\n  15 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 16 of 33\\n73.

Jonathan Blades was sentenced in docket number 2014 CF1 002153 in the Superior \\nCourt of the District of Columbia to a term of incarceration to be served in the BOP on March 20, \\n2015, for violations of D.C. Code provisions.   \\n79.  Following his sentencing, the BOP prepared a custody classification form for Mr. \\nBlades to determine his security classification score. \\n80.  As part of the BOP\\u2019s determination of Mr. Blades\\u2019 security classification score, the \\nBOP calculated Mr. Blades\\u2019 criminal history points and resulting criminal history score. \\n  16 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 17 of 33\\n81.  Because Mr. Blades was sentenced by the Superior Court for a D.C. Code offense, \\nthe BOP applied Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s scoring rule to determine Mr. Blades had six \\ncriminal history points, which converted to a criminal history score of four, see supra \\u00b6 30. \\n82.  Mr. Blades was assessed points under Program Statement 5100.08 that he would \\nnot have been assessed under the Sentencing Guidelines. \\n83.  According to Mr. Blades\\u2019 presentence report, he has seven prior convictions: \\na.  A 2002 juvenile conviction for carrying a dangerous weapon for which he received \\nprobation; \\nb.  A 2003 juvenile \\u201cOut of Probation\\u201d conviction for which he received probation; \\nc.  A  2002  adult  conviction  for  possession  of  marijuana  for  which  he  received \\nprobation, which was revoked to time served; \\nd.  A 2002 adult conviction for distribution of marijuana for which he received a \\nsuspended sentence of 180 days imprisonment with 3 years of probation; \\ne.  A 2006 adult conviction for reckless driving for which he received 10 days \\nimprisonment; \\nf.  A 2006 adult conviction for possession of a controlled substance and driving while \\nintoxicated for which he received a 90-day and 30-day suspended sentence with 12 \\nmonths of probation; \\ng.  A 2006 adult conviction for possession of a prohibited weapon for which he \\nreceived a 1-year sentence. \\n84.  Under Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s scoring rule, Mr. Blades received six criminal \\nhistory points.  \\n  17 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 18 of 33\\n85.  Mr.  Blades  likely  received  one  point  each  for  his  2002  and  2003  juvenile \\nconvictions (convictions (a) and (b) in paragraph 83) pursuant to subsection (c) of the BOP\\u2019s \\ncriminal history scoring rule: \\u201cAdd 1 point for each prior conviction not counted in (a) or (b),\\u201d PS \\n5100.08 at 33.  \\n86.  Mr. Blades likely received one point each for his 2002 convictions for possession \\nof marijuana and distribution of marijuana (convictions (c) and (d) in paragraph 83) pursuant to \\nsubsection (c) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule, PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n87.  Mr. Blades received two points for his 2006 adult conviction for possessing a \\nprohibited weapon (conviction (g) in paragraph 83) pursuant to subsection (b) of the BOP\\u2019s \\ncriminal history scoring rule: \\u201c2 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty \\ndays\\u201d and less than one year and one month, PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n88.  Had Mr. Blades been scored according to the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\nhistory points calculation, he would only have received three criminal history points, resulting \\nin a criminal history score of two: \\na.  Mr. Blades would receive one point for his 2006 adult convictions for possessing a \\ncontrolled substance offense and driving while intoxicated offense (conviction (f) \\nin paragraph 83) because there was no intervening arrest and he was sentenced on \\nthe same day for both offenses, see USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). \\nb.  Mr. Blades would receive two points for his 2006 adult conviction for possessing a \\nprohibited weapon (conviction (g) in paragraph 83) pursuant to USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(b). \\n89.  Mr. Blades would not have received any points for his two juvenile adjudications.  \\nSee USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(d) (excluding juvenile convictions unless they were committed close in time \\nto the instant offense). \\n  18 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 19 of 33\\n90.  Mr. Blades would not have received any points for his 2002 convictions for \\npossession  of  marijuana  and  distribution  of  marijuana.    See  USSG  \\u00a7  4A1.2(e)  (excluding \\nconvictions that did not result in more than one year and one month of incarceration unless the \\nsentence was imposed \\u201cwithin ten years of the defendant\\u2019s commencement of the instant offense\\u201d).  \\n91.  Mr. Blades would not have received any points for his 2006 conviction for reckless \\ndriving.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c) (\\u201creckless driving\\u201d not counted unless sentence was a term of \\nimprisonment of at least 30 days or was similar to instant offense). \\n92.  In part because of Mr. Blades\\u2019 arbitrarily higher criminal history score, he is being \\nincarcerated in a high security facility (USP) in the BOP. \\n93.  As a result of his incarceration in a high security facility, Mr. Blades is stigmatized \\nand treated worse than identically situated incarcerated people solely because of the court in which \\nhe was convicted. \\n94.  Mr. Blades has less access to educational and vocational programming at a high \\nsecurity facility compared to people incarcerated at lower security facilities. \\n95.  Because he is incarcerated at a high security facility, Mr. Blades is afforded fewer \\nliberties than BOP residents at medium or low security facilities, including less time out of his cell, \\nless time outside, and less freedom of movement. \\n96.  Because  he  is  incarcerated  at  a  high  security  facility,  Mr.  Blades  has  fewer \\nopportunities to speak with his family and his loved ones than BOP residents at medium or low \\nsecurity facilities \\n97.  Because he is incarcerated at a high security facility, Mr. Blades is subjected to \\nmore violence and disciplinary incidents than BOP residents at medium or low security facilities. \\n  19 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 20 of 33\\n98.  Because  he  is  incarcerated  at  a  high  security  facility,  Mr.  Blades  cannot  be \\nconsidered for release to home confinement.  \\n99.  Mr. Blades is seeking a transfer to a medium or low security facility and is seeking \\nrelease to home confinement. \\n100.  Mr. Blades\\u2019 PATTERN score is also higher than similarly situated BOP residents, \\nmeaning that Mr. Blades will earn fewer good time credits, not be eligible for home confinement, \\nand be negatively impacted by an incorrect risk recidivism assessment. \\nPlaintiff Antwan Buchanan \\n101.  Antwan Buchanan was sentenced in docket number 2016 CF1 016142 in the \\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia to a term of incarceration to be served in the Bureau of \\nPrisons on December 14, 2018, for violations of D.C. Code provisions.   \\n102.  Following his sentence, the BOP prepared a custody classification form for Mr. \\nBuchanan to determine his security classification score. \\n103.  As part of the BOP\\u2019s determination of Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s security classification score, \\nthe BOP calculated Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s criminal history score. \\n104.  Because Mr. Buchanan was sentenced by the Superior Court for a D.C. Code \\noffense, the BOP applied Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s scoring rule to determine Mr. Buchanan \\nhad 20 criminal history points, which converted to a criminal history score of 10.   \\n105.  Mr. Buchanan was assessed points under Program Statement 5100.08 that he would \\nnot have been assessed under the Sentencing Guidelines. \\n106.  According to Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s presentence report, he has six prior convictions: \\n  20 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 21 of 33\\na.

A 2002 adult conviction for possession of marijuana for which he received a time \\nserved sentence; \\nc.  A 2004 adult conviction for one count of operating a vehicle with a suspended \\nlicense and one count of operating an unregistered vehicle for which he received a \\nsuspended sentence of 90 days of incarceration; \\nd.

Mr. Buchanan received one point for his 2002 adult conviction for possession of \\nmarijuana (conviction (b) in paragraph 106) pursuant to subsection (c) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal \\nhistory scoring rule: \\u201cAdd 1 point for each prior conviction not counted,\\u201d PS 5100.08 at 33. \\n110.  Mr. Buchanan received one point each for the two counts of his 2004 conviction \\n(conviction (c) in paragraph 106) pursuant to subsection (c) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring \\nrule. \\n111.  Mr. Buchanan received a total of five points for his 2006 conviction (conviction (d) \\nin paragraph 106): one point for the simple assault (because he received 45 days imprisonment), \\nand two points each for the possession of a controlled substance counts (because he received 60 \\ndays imprisonment each), pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring \\nrule. \\n112.  Mr. Buchanan received a total of six points for his 2008 conviction (conviction (e) \\nin paragraph 106): three points for the aggravated assault and three points for the carrying a \\ndangerous weapon counts (because he received more than one year and one month in prison for \\neach count), pursuant to subsection (a) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule.  \\n113.  Mr. Buchanan might have received an extra point for his 2014 possession with \\nintent to distribute marijuana (conviction (e) in paragraph 106) pursuant to subsection (c) of the \\nBOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule even though he had already reached the total of 4 points that \\ncan be awarded under subsection (c), see PS 5100.08 at 33 (\\u201cAdd 1 point for each prior conviction \\nnot counted * * * up to a total of 4 points for this item\\u201d). \\n114.  Mr. Buchanan received two points because he was under supervision at the time of \\nthe instant offense pursuant to subsection (d) of the BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule, PS \\n5100.08 at 34. \\n  22 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 23 of 33\\n115.  Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s score under Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring \\nrule should have been 19 criminal history points, but the BOP incorrectly calculated and awarded \\nMr. Buchanan 20 criminal history points. \\n116.  Had Mr. Buchanan been scored under the Sentencing Guidelines, he would only \\nreceive 12 criminal history points, which converts to a criminal history score of 8. \\na.  Mr.  Buchanan  would  have  received  three  points  for  his  1992  conviction  for \\npossessing a firearm during a violent offense because he was \\u201cincarcerated during \\nany part of\\u201d the 15-year period before his instant offense.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(1). \\nb.  Mr. Buchanan would have received only two points for his 2006 conviction for one \\ncount of simple assault and two counts of possession of a controlled substance \\nbecause they are part of a single sentence that resulted in a sentence of incarceration \\nof 60 days, see USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). \\nc.  Mr. Buchanan would have received four points for his 2008 conviction for one \\ncount of aggravated assault and one count of carrying a dangerous weapon \\u2014 three \\npoints for the carrying a dangerous weapon count, because that count resulted in a \\nsentence of incarceration over one year and one month, see USSG \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(a), \\n4A1.2(e)(2), and one point for the aggravated assault under the catch-all provision \\nthat \\u201c[a]dd[s] one point for each prior sentence resulting from a conviction of a \\ncrime of violence that did not [already] receive any points * * * because such \\nsentence was treated as a single sentence,\\u201d USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(e). \\nd.  Mr. Buchanan would have received one point for his 2014 conviction for possession \\nwith intent to distribute marijuana.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(c). \\n  23 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 24 of 33\\ne.  Mr. Buchanan would have received two points for committing the instant offense \\nwhile under supervision.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(e). \\n117.  Mr. Buchanan would not receive any points under the Sentencing Guidelines for \\nhis 2002 conviction for possession of marijuana because it is outside the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 \\n10-year look-back period.  See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). \\n118.  Mr. Buchanan would not receive any points under the Sentencing Guidelines for \\nhis 2004 convictions for one count of operating a vehicle with a suspended license and one count \\nof  operating  an  unregistered  vehicle  because  those  convictions  are  outside  the  Sentencing \\nGuidelines\\u2019 ten-year look-back period, see USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). \\n119.  Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s criminal history score is unjustifiably higher than what it would be \\nif he were scored under the Sentencing Guidelines and has contributed to his incarceration in a \\nhigh security USP.   \\n120.  As  a  result  of  his  incarceration  in  a  high  security  facility,  Mr.  Buchanan  is \\nstigmatized and treated worse than identically situated incarcerated people solely because of the \\ncourt in which he was convicted. \\n121.  Mr.  Buchanan  has  significantly  less  access  to  educational  and  vocational \\nprogramming at a high security facility compared to people incarcerated at lower security facility.  \\n122.  Mr. Buchanan has sought to enroll in a forklift operation course at his high security \\nfacility, but one is not available at that facility while it is available at medium and low security \\nfacilities.  \\n123.  Mr. Buchanan is unable to earn as much money at his prison job in his high security \\nfacility than he would be if he were held at a medium or low security facility. \\n  24 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 25 of 33\\n124.  Mr. Buchanan has fewer opportunities to speak to his family and loved ones at his \\nhigh security facility than residents at medium or low security facilities have to speak to their \\nfamilies and loved ones. \\n125.  Mr. Buchanan has fewer opportunities to leave his cell and to breathe fresh air \\noutside than residents at medium or low security facilities.  \\n126.  Mr. Buchanan is unable to practice his religion to the same extent as residents at a \\nmedium or low security facility are able to practice the same religion, in part because high security \\nfacilities  have  fewer  chaplains  and  fewer  religious  resources  than  medium  or  low  security \\nfacilities.  \\n127.  Mr. Buchanan is seeking transfer to a medium or low security facility and release \\nto home confinement.  \\n128.  Mr.  Buchanan\\u2019s  PATTERN  score is  also  higher  than  similarly  situated  BOP \\nresidents, meaning that Mr. Buchanan will earn fewer good time credits and serve a longer prison \\nsentence  than  residents  whose  criminal  history  scores  are  calculated  under  the  Sentencing \\nGuidelines. \\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \\n129.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), Jonathan Blades \\nand Antwan Buchanan bring this action as a class consisting of all people who are or will be \\nconvicted of District of Columbia code offenses who were sentenced from the Superior Court of \\nthe District of Columbia and who are held in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. \\n130.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend the class definition or to establish sub-classes \\nas appropriate if discovery or further investigation reveals that the class should be expanded  \\n  25 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 26 of 33\\n131.  Numerosity: The class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable.  While the \\nprecise size of the class is unknown and is constantly changing, Plaintiffs believe that roughly \\n3,500 people currently fit the class definition, although the composition of the class changes daily.   \\n132.  Joinder of these thousands of people is impractical because the number of unnamed, \\nfuture class members who will be subject to the challenged policy is unknown and unknowable.   \\n133.  Proposed class members are highly unlikely to file individual suits on their own \\nbehalf given the practical, legal, and monetary difficulties that prevent incarcerated people serving \\nsentences in the BOP from accessing independent counsel. \\n134.  Commonality: The claims of the class share common issues of law, including but \\nnot limited to whether the challenged policy violates the APA and the Fifth Amendment. \\n135.  Typicality: The claims of Jonathan Blades and Antwan Buchanan are typical of \\nthose of the class as a whole because their criminal history points were assessed under the \\nchallenged policy and they would receive lower criminal history points, a lower criminal history \\nscore, and lower security point score, if they were scored the same as similarly situated BOP \\nresidents who were sentenced by a federal district court. \\n136.  Adequacy: Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives who meet all requirements \\nof Rule 23(a)(4).  They have no conflict of interest with other class members and will fairly and \\nadequately protect the interests of the class. \\n137.  Plaintiffs\\u2019 counsel will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class, and counsel \\nhave experience with the factual and legal issues litigated in this case, as well as with representing \\nplaintiffs in federal civil rights class actions.  \\n138.  Defendant has acted and will act on grounds generally applicable to the class, \\nthereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a whole.  This is \\n  26 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 27 of 33\\nbecause Defendant\\u2019s actions were taken pursuant to a policy and practice of the BOP.  A permanent \\ninjunction of the policy will therefore benefit all class members. \\nCAUSES OF ACTION \\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTION IN VIOLATION OF THE \\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\n \\n139.  The APA requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful and set aside agency \\naction\\u201d that is \\u201carbitrary,\\u201d \\u201ccapricious,\\u201d or \\u201can abuse of discretion.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(A).   \\n140.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is an \\u201cagency\\u201d under the APA.  5 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 551(1). \\n141.  The  BOP\\u2019s  criminal  history  scoring  scheme,  set  forth  in  Program  Statement \\n5100.08, is final agency action that is reviewable under the APA because it represents the end of \\nthe agency\\u2019s decisionmaking process and creates legal consequences, namely, the increased \\nlikelihood  of  more  restrictions  on  liberty,  unconstitutionally  disparate  treatment  and \\nstigmatization, and other harmful effects on Plaintiffs and proposed class members. \\n142.  Program  Statement  5100.08\\u2019s  criminal  history  scoring  rule  for  individuals \\nsentenced by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse \\nof discretion because the BOP failed to consider significant disparities between its scheme and the \\nU.S. Sentencing Guideline\\u2019s scoring rules for individuals with federal sentences.  The BOP also \\nfailed to consider how these differences result in systematically higher criminal history scores and \\nsecurity  point  scores  for  individuals  with  D.C.  sentences,  which  contributes  to  their \\ndisproportionate placement in higher security facilities. \\n143.  The BOP also failed to consider the discriminatory racial impacts of such a policy \\nas the overwhelming majority of individuals sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court are Black, and \\n  27 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 28 of 33\\nthe BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule contributes to these individuals having higher criminal \\nhistory scores, higher security classifications, and more restrictive housing placements.   \\n144.  Defendants\\u2019 decision, in the challenged policy, to treat Plaintiffs and proposed class \\nmembers more harshly than their federal counterparts is arbitrary and capricious. \\n145.  Defendants\\u2019 policy causes Plaintiffs and proposed class members injuries because \\nit subjects them to unconstitutional and discriminatory treatment, unduly restricts their liberty, \\ndenies them programming opportunities, and subjects them to institutions with greater incidents \\nof violence.   \\n146.  The challenged policy violates the APA because it is arbitrary and capricious and \\nit therefore must be set aside. \\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nACTION CONTRARY TO LAW, IN VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE \\nPROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\n \\n147.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful \\nand set aside agency action\\u201d that is \\u201cotherwise not in accordance with law.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(A).   \\n148.  The BOP\\u2019s Criminal History Score policy violates the APA because it is \\u201cnot in \\naccordance with law\\u201d\\u2014in this case, the BOP\\u2019s own regulation that it \\u201cshall not discriminate \\nagainst inmates on the basis of race * * * [in] the making of administrative decisions and providing \\naccess to work, housing and programs.\\u201d 28 C.F.R. \\u00a7 551.90. \\n149.  The overwhelming number of individuals sentenced by D.C. Superior Court \\u2014 \\nover 95 percent \\u2014 are Black.  The BOP closely maintains statistics on the race of its residents and \\nis aware that policies affecting individuals with D.C. sentences would impact a majority Black \\npopulation.  Therefore, Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule \\u2014 which \\nresults in higher criminal history scores and more restrictive housing \\u2014 disproportionately affects \\n  28 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 29 of 33\\nBlack residents in BOP\\u2019s custody as compared to its majority-white federal population, in violation \\nof the BOP\\u2019s own anti-discrimination housing regulations. \\n150.  Because Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule violates the \\nBOP\\u2019s own regulation, it violates the APA\\u2019s lawfulness requirement and must be set aside. \\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nACTION CONTRARY TO CONSTITUITONAL RIGHT, IN VIOLATION OF THE \\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\n \\n151.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful \\nand  set  aside  agency  action\\u201d  that  is  \\u201ccontrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or \\nimmunity.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(B).   \\n152.  The BOP\\u2019s Criminal History Score policy violates the APA because it is \\u201ccontrary \\nto constitutional right\\u201d\\u2014in this case, the Fifth Amendment\\u2019s right to equal protection.   This claim \\nincorporates all of the points raised with regards to the Constitutional claim, see infra \\u00b6\\u00b6 154\\u2013160.   \\n153.  Because Program Statement 5100.08 violates the Fifth Amendment, it also runs \\nafoul of the APA\\u2019s requirement that rules not conflict with constitutional rights and privileges. \\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE \\nFIFTH AMENDMENT \\n \\n154.  The Fifth Amendment precludes the federal government from treating similarly \\nsituated parties differently for no rational reason.  See 3883 Connecticut LLC v. District of \\nColumbia, 336 F.3d 1068, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Fraternal Order of Police v. United States, 152 \\nF.3d 998, 1002 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (\\u201cEqual protection analysis is substantially identical under the \\nFifth Amendment and the Fourteenth.\\u201d), reh\\u2019g granted on other grounds, 173 F.3d 898 (D.C. Cir. \\n1999). \\n  29 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 30 of 33\\n155.  Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members,  who  were  sentenced  to  a  term  of \\nimprisonment by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, are similarly situated to other \\nBOP residents who were sentenced to a term of imprisonment by any of the federal district courts.  \\nBy law, individuals \\u201csentenced pursuant to the D.C. Code * * * shall be subject to any law or \\nregulation applicable to persons committed for violations of laws of the United States * * * and \\nthe Bureau of Prisons shall be responsible for [their] custody[.]\\u201d  D.C. Code \\u00a7 24-101.  Therefore, \\npursuant to District of Columbia law, individuals sentenced by the Superior Court are intended to \\nbe \\u201csubject\\u201d to the same treatment as individuals sentenced by any of the federal district courts \\nand the BOP is charged with their custody and equal treatment. \\n156.  There is no rational basis to treat Plaintiffs and proposed class members differently \\nthan BOP residents sentenced by federal district courts with regards to housing, programming \\nopportunities, and eligibility for home confinement.   \\n157.  Defendants\\u2019  policy  violates  the  Fifth  Amendment  because  it  treats  similarly \\nsituated parties disparately without a rational basis to do so.   \\n158.  The BOP acted without rational basis and contrary to equal protection principles \\nwhen it implemented a policy that significantly and disparately impacted the 95 percent Black \\npopulation of individuals with D.C. sentences.  By subjecting the majority Black population of \\nindividuals with D.C. sentences to a harsher criminal history scoring system, these individuals \\nhave systematically higher criminal history scores, higher security classifications, and more \\nrestrictive housing placements, than their majority-white federal counterparts.   \\n159.  Because of Defendants\\u2019 policy, Plaintiff and proposed class are more likely to be \\ndesignated to higher security level facilities with more rigorous constraints on their liberty, less \\n  30 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 31 of 33\\naccess to programming and work opportunities, less access to religious services, and more \\nviolence.  \\n160.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants\\u2019 conduct, Plaintiff and the proposed \\nclass have suffered and will continue to suffer harm that is irreparable because the BOP\\u2019s criminal \\nhistory scoring rule is controlling and Plaintiff and the proposed class are unable to challenge their \\ncriminal history score, security classification, or facility designation in court. \\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\nACTION WITHOUT OBSERVANCE OF PROCEDURE REQUIRED BY LAW IN \\nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\n \\n161.  The APA requires the reviewing court \\u201cto hold unlawful and set aside\\u201d agency \\naction promulgated \\u201cwithout observance of procedure required by law.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(D). \\n162.  The APA requires that legislative rules undergo a notice and comment period as \\npart of the rulemaking process.  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 553. \\n163.  The Defendants\\u2019 criminal history scoring rule (Program Statement 5100.08) is a \\nbinding,  legislative  rule  that  has  the  force  and  effect  of  law  because  it  provides  concrete, \\ncontrolling, singular guidance for calculating criminal history score, which has a direct and \\nsignificant impact on security classifications and places of imprisonment.   \\n164.  Defendants did not undergo a notice and comment period when adopting Program \\nStatement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule, and thus, the public, key stakeholders, including \\nfederal and D.C. agencies involved in criminal justice work, and those subject to the rule, could \\nnot participate or comment on the rule or its wide-ranging effects. \\n165.  The challenged policy violates the APA and must be set aside because the BOP did \\nnot observe the required notice and comment process before adopting the policy.   \\n \\n  31 \\n\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 32 of 33\\nRELIEF REQUESTED \\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \\na.  Declare that the criminal history scoring rule for individuals with D.C. sentences \\npresented in Program Statement 5100.08, ch. 4, \\u00a7 8, is: \\n\\u2022  An arbitrary and capricious action, in violation of the Administrative Procedure \\nAct, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\n\\u2022  An action not in accordance with the law, in violation of the Administrative \\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\n\\u2022  An  action  not  in  accordance  with  the  Constitution,  in  violation  of  the \\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\n\\u2022  An action promulgated without observance of procedure required by law, in \\nviolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; and \\n\\u2022  Unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \\nb.  Vacate and set aside the separate criminal history scoring rule set forth in Program \\nStatement 5100.08, ch. 4, \\u00a7 8; \\nc.  Grant a preliminary injunction and permanent injunction preventing Defendant, its \\nsubordinates, agents, and employees from assessing the criminal history score of \\nindividuals sentenced by D.C.

The district court held that conditions in the\\nOklahoma prison system violated the Eighth Amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. The\\n[1]\\nsubsequent history of the controversy is detailed in the opinions cited in the margin.\\nIn April, 1982, the district court entered an order that defendants \\\"should have and do hereby have the authority\\nindefinitely but not permanently to double-cell where necessary,\\\" 708 F.2d 1523 at 1526, following increases in\\nthe Oklahoma prison population. In October, 1982, the district court issued an opinion following an evidentiary\\nhearing on its orders that had previously been entered. The court stated that although it would not conclude from\\nthe evidence that the system had become unconstitutional in its operation, it was clearly in a state of decline. 708\\n1423 F.2d at 1539. The court continued jurisdiction over the case to insure that the Oklahoma prison system did *1423\\nnot revert to an unconstitutional condition. Id. The court ordered that a statement of penal policy and detailed plan\\nof action be filed.\\nThis court affirmed, one judge dissenting. Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d 1523 (10th Cir.1983),cert. dismissed,465\\nU.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1019, 79 L.Ed.2d 248 (1984). The majority of the panel held that the district court did not\\nabuse its discretion in continuing its jurisdiction to assure compliance with past decrees and to prevent a\\nrecurrence of unconstitutional conditions despite its finding that the system was then currently constitutional. Id.\\nat 1537-40.\\nThe instant controversy concerns events following that decision. In compliance with the district court's order, the\\nState filed a detailed \\\"Plan of Measures to be Taken to Assure Continued Constitutionality of Oklahoma's Prisons\\\"\\nin June, 1983, and in July the State filed a supplement to the Plan. In September, 1983, the court held an\\nevidentiary hearing on the State's Plan and the State's motion to dismiss the case. Judge Bohanon recused in\\nDecember, 1983, and the case was assigned to Chief Judge Seay. Following review of a portion of the record, he\\nentered the order on appeal herein on December 30.\\n\\nThe court concluded that \\\"since October 1982 to the present date the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma\\nprison system are constitutional and are not cruel and unusual punishment.\\\" X Jt.App. 237. The court noted that\\nthere had been \\\"disturbances, problems, and inadequacies in the Oklahoma prison system since the court's last\\nfindings.\\\" Id. at 235. The court noted that there were four subjects of previous court orders still found to be\\ninadequate and not in compliance 00 racial integration, access to the courts, equal protection guarantees for\\n97\\nwomen, and vacating for human habitation the East and West Cellhouses of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\nMcAlester. Id.\\nThe court concluded nevertheless that the system was constitutional and \\\"each area of continued violation has\\nbeen specifically addressed by the State and is subject to a specifically planned remedy.\\\" Id. The court found that\\nthe State legislature and prison officials were aware of and sensitive to the constitutional requirements and that\\nthe court was satisfied \\\"that there is no reasonable expectation that unconstitutional practices will recur in the\\nconditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system.\\\" Id. at 238. Concluding that it was mindful of its\\nobligation to enforce the constitutional rights of all persons, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the\\ncase in its entirety. However, the court concluded that \\\"[a]ll of this court's orders and injunctions as modified\\nheretofore remain in full force and effect.\\\" Id. at 239.\\nIn May, 1984, the district court denied a motion by plaintiffs to stay the dismissal order. Responding to a\\ncomplaint that the judge had not had the full record to review, the judge noted that he had had four of seven\\ntranscripts from the September hearing for review before entering the order; that he had all the transcripts\\ncontaining plaintiffs' case-in-chief; and that he had earlier had the transcript volume with the testimony of the\\nGovernor and the Director of the Corrections Department. In denying the request for a stay, the court concluded\\nthat \\\"[a]fter a careful review and study of the entire transcript, the court finds no reason to change its order of\\nDecember 30, 1983, and the court reaffirms that order.\\\" Id. at 248. The court stated that \\\"[a]lthough the court\\nnoted problems of compliance in certain areas, those areas were not held to be constitutional violations.\\\" Id.\\n(emphasis in original).\\nOn April 25, 1984, a panel of this court denied an application by the plaintiffs for a stay of the dismissal order,\\npending appeal. On May 25, 1985, plaintiffs filed a further motion for a stay of the dismissal order, pending\\nappeal, contending that the State was housing inmates in the East and West Cellhouses in violation of the district\\ncourt's order of May, 1979. The State responded that the inmates were temporarily housed in those cellhouses\\n1424 on May 13, 1985, as a result of a disturbance at another *1424 State prison, and that the inmates were removed\\nfrom them on May 28. Plaintiffs did not dispute these facts but did request that this court stay the dismissal order\\nnevertheless. We denied the renewed application for a stay, stating that we would \\\"consider the propriety and\\nscope of the district court's December 30, 1983, order in our disposition of the pending appeal in this cause.\\\" A\\nmotion to reconsider that ruling was filed, but in view of our disposition of the case the motion becomes moot.\\nWe turn now to the appellate arguments challenging the correctness of the district court's order of dismissal.\\nII\\nPlaintiffs challenge the district court's holding that the prison system is constitutional. They argue that the system\\nis unconstitutional with respect to access to the courts, racial integration, and equal protection guarantees for\\nwomen 00 areas that the district court found to be \\\"inadequate and not in compliance\\\" with previous court orders.\\n97\\nPlaintiffs also contend that the Oklahoma prison system, considering the totality of the circumstances, is in\\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.\\nA.\\n\\nAccess to the courts\\n[2]\\nPlaintiffs attack the defendants' reliance on inmate law clerks to provide meaningful access to the courts.

We have previously noted, however, that \\\"[u]nder Bounds,\\nthe State is free to make a choice between affording law library facilities on a reasonable basis, or the alternative\\nmeans of having available counsel on a reasonable basis.\\\" Ward v. Kort, 762 F.2d 856, 860 (10th Cir.1985). The\\ndistrict court's dismissal order stated:\\nThe court finds that the mandated minimums of adequate library facilities has not yet been met. \\nBounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 [97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72] (1976). However, testimony from\\nMr. Larry Meachum, Director of the Department of Corrections of Oklahoma, at the September\\n1983 hearing, indicates and assures this court that libraries will be fully stocked and that plaintiffs\\nhave and will be assured continued access to courts.\\nX Jt.App. 235. In this connection, the defendants' Plan stated that the State intended \\\"to continue their current\\napproach to access to courts by providing both law libraries and trained inmate law clerks to assist inmates in\\nframing legal issues for presentation to the court.\\\" X R. 113; see id. at 113-14.\\nThere is record evidence that the Department of Corrections has a large or small library at each of the prison\\nfacilities. Inventories were admitted in evidence as Defendants' Exhibits 29, 30, and 31 respecting the major law\\nlibraries at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center, and the Joseph Harp\\nCorrectional Center. V Jt.App. 1041. Each library has a supervisor. The fact finder appointed by the district court\\nhad found an \\\"appalling lack of essential legal books and reference materials at both major and minor law\\nlibraries.\\\" VIII Jt.App. 119. However, we note that the inventories do list a substantial volume of basic materials in\\nthe libraries. See, e.g., Defendants' Exhibit 29 (containing extensive listing of law books at Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary Library). Further, defendants' Plan represented to the court that \\\"the Department is continually\\n[3]\\nupdating and supplementing its law library inventories.\\\" X Jt.App. 114.\\n1425 *1425 In light of the testimony, the documentary evidence, and the representations accepted by the district court,\\nwe hold that the finding of the court that there was no constitutional violation in this respect is not in error.\\nB.\\nThe claim of racial discrimination\\nEarlier practices of racial discrimination in the Oklahoma prison system were chronicled in Battle v. Anderson,\\n376 F.Supp. at 410-11. In that opinion, the district court made conclusions of law on these practices, id. at\\n420-21, and entered orders designed to remedy the discrimination. Id. at 428-30. The State has endeavored\\nsince those orders to comply with the constitutional requirements.\\nIn the instant proceeding there are numerous allegations of racial discrimination and segregation in the\\nOklahoma prison system, including discrimination in job assignments, dining hall seating, and cell assignments.\\nNumerous examples are contained in the fact finder's March 1983 final compliance report, VIII Jt.App. 25-43, and\\nin the arguments and record citations in the briefs of the plaintiffs-appellants in this phase of the controversy.\\nBrief of Appellants 15-16, 43; Reply Brief of Appellants 12-14. The State and the United States as intervenor\\nargue that the evidence supports a finding of nondiscrimination. Brief of State Defendants-Appellees 101-02;\\nBrief for the United States as Appellee 26-28.\\nIn addition, the plaintiffs-appellants argue that the trial court did not address these issues in the December 30,\\n1983 order of dismissal. In that regard, we note that the district court did make the following findings and\\nconclusions respecting this claim of racial discrimination:\\n\\nRacial integration of the occupants of double cells is found to be almost non-existent in the\\nOklahoma prison system. Racial integration of cells is strictly by voluntary action only. However, a\\ncommitment by defendants to fully integrate is contained in the Defendants' Plan. The court finds\\nthe Defendants' Plan to be of sufficient remedial effect and has previously, in this order, approved\\nand ordered its adoption.\\nX Jt.App. 235.\\nIn view of the findings quoted above, we cannot agree with the plaintiffs-appellants that the trial court did not\\naddress the racial discrimination claim at all. Nevertheless, because of the several distinct questions clearly\\nraised by the fact finder's findings and the specific issues joined by the parties, we must agree that the findings of\\nthe district court are not sufficient under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. We cannot perform our appellate function\\nwithout adequate findings and conclusions by the trial court on this issue of fundamental constitutional\\nimportance. Battle v. Anderson, 614 F.2d 251, 256 (10th Cir.1980); Squirtco v. Seven-Up Co., 628 F.2d 1086,\\n1902 (8th Cir.1980). Without expressing any view on the validity of the constitutional claim of racial discrimination,\\nwe hold that the findings and conclusions thereon are not sufficient due to the sharp conflict on the several claims\\nof specific discriminatory treatment not addressed by the trial judge.\\nAccordingly, with respect to this claim of racial discrimination, the judgment of dismissal must be vacated and the\\ncase remanded on that claim for such further proceedings as the district court deems proper. In view of the\\nintervening time lapse it may well be desirable that further evidence on this claim be received. After the further\\nproceedings which the trial court finds proper are held, the district judge should then find the facts specially and\\nstate separately his conclusions thereon in detail, dealing with the various claims of racial discrimination in\\naccordance with Rule 52(a).\\nC.\\nThe claim of sex discrimination\\n1426 Under the Equal Protection Clause, the plaintiffs-appellants argue vigorously *1426 that women inmates in the\\nOklahoma prison system are subjected to discrimination in conditions of confinement, job assignments, training\\nprograms, mental and medical health services, and recreation. These were objections made by the plaintiffs to\\ndeficiencies in the fact finder's final compliance report. X Jt.App. 58-61. The specific claims arise from the fact\\nthat the State in a stipulation had agreed not to discriminate against inmates on various grounds, including sex,\\nand had agreed further to provide equal access to various programs and work assignments. Brief of Appellants\\n22; Brief for the United States as Appellee 30 n. 22.\\nThe district court's order of dismissal contains the following discussion of this issue:\\nThe court finds that equal protection guarantees for women inmates are inadequate in terms of\\nprograms, medical care, and exercise. However, Director Meachum testified there is a $62,000.00\\ncurrent special appropriation for women's programs and detailed the specific remedies outlined in\\nthe Defendants' Plan. The court finds the proposed measures will continue constitutionality.\\nX Jt.App. 236.\\nWith respect to the claim of violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the treatment of women inmates, we feel\\nthat the findings are not inadequate. The trial court specifically found inadequacies in terms of programs, medical\\ncare, and exercise. We feel that the remaining claims of inadequate housing were thus implicitly rejected.\\nFurthermore, the trial judge specifically identified the testimony which he credited, that of Director Meachum. His\\ntestimony concerning a $62,000 current special appropriation for women's programs was identified. Moreover,\\nthe court concluded that the program laid out by Director Meachum would be constitutionally sufficient. We note\\nthat Director Meachum's testimony explained the reason for not having an intermediate health unit for the Mabel\\n\\nBassett facility in the Oklahoma City area. He pointed out that they had a psychiatrist assigned to the Mabel\\nBassett facility addressing the mental health needs of women. VII Jt.App. 95-97.\\nOn consideration of the evidence relied on by the plaintiffs, the evidence cited by the trial judge, and the resolve\\nshown in the testimony of Director Meachum to solve the problem, we cannot say that the findings and\\nconclusions of the trial judge on this constitutional claim were in error.\\nD.\\nThe Eighth Amendment claim\\nPlaintiffs further vigorously challenge the findings and conclusions of the district court which rejected their claim\\nthat the totality of the circumstances in the Oklahoma prison system amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in\\nviolation of the prohibition of the Eighth Amendment. More specifically, they seriously complain about\\novercrowding, food and kitchen facilities, ventilation, educational and training programs, medical and mental\\nhealth services, and the occupation temporarily of the East and West Cellhouses at the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary in violation of the May 4, 1979 order of Judge Bohanon.\\nIn connection with this constitutional claim and the detailed complaints made, the district court's findings and\\nconclusions against the plaintiffs were as follows:\\n[T]he court finds that management problems exist in the Oklahoma system. Problem areas can be\\ndetermined in food preparation and service, maintenance of equipment and facilities, distribution\\nof clothing and essential supplies, and inmate idleness. These management problems exist\\ndespite the extremely professional staff of the Oklahoma prison system. These problems are\\nfound to be primarily a direct result of increases in prison population.\\nUnfortunately, there will always be problems and inadequacies. We are considering a large,\\nconfined population of convicted felons, not a nursery school. As noted by Judge Barrett, \\\"The \\n1427 Rhodes majority observed that harsh or restrictive *1427 conditions of confinement are part of the\\npunishment criminal offenders justly receive because the Constitution does not mandate\\ncomfortable prisons. Justice Powell wrote that `To the extent that such conditions [of confinement]\\nare restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their\\noffenses against society.' 452 U.S. [337] at p. 347 [101 S.Ct. 2392 at p. 2399, 69 L.Ed.2d 59].\\\" \\nBattle v. Anderson, supra at page 1535.\\nThe court finds, considering the totality of circumstances, these inadequacies, problems, and\\nshortcomings do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the test of Rhodes. Rhodes v.\\nChapman, supra at page 347 [101 S.Ct. at page 2399]. The court finds no evidence at this time to\\nshow that the plaintiffs' present conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system have\\nchanged from one of constitutionality to unconstitutionality. Thus, the court finds that since\\nOctober 1982 to the present date the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system\\nare constitutional and are not cruel and unusual punishment.\\nX Jt.App. 236-37.\\nFor reasons we will outline generally, from our review of the record testimony and exhibits, and from the\\narguments about the record evidence by plaintiffs, we conclude that the district court's findings were not clearly\\nerroneous, that the conclusions drawn were supported by the findings and record, and that the determination of\\nthe court to dismiss the cause in its entirety, retaining in full force and effect the prior orders and injunctions\\nagainst constitutional violations, was not in error.\\nWe have noted that there are specific complaints concerning conditions of confinement, including overcrowding,\\nfood and kitchen facilities, ventilation, educational and training programs, medical and mental health services,\\nand the temporary occupancy of the East and West Cellhouses. See Brief of Appellants 4-22, 30-36. However,\\n\\nthe ban on cruel and unusual punishment prohibits conditions that \\\"involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction\\nof pain, [or are] grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment.\\\" Rhodes v.\\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2399, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); see Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312,\\n___-___, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 1082-86, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). Although prison inmates may not be deprived of the\\n\\\"minimal civilized measure of life's necessities,.. conditions that cannot be said to be cruel and unusual under\\ncontemporary standards are not unconstitutional. To the extent that such conditions are restrictive and even\\nharsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.\\\" Rhodes v.\\nChapman, 452 U.S. at 347, 101 S.Ct. at 2399.\\nA little over two years ago a panel of this court agreed that the overall conditions of the Oklahoma prison system\\nat that time were constitutional. Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d at 1533, 1537. We have considered the plaintiffs'\\ncomplaints and the arguments in their briefs concerning the evidence in this subsequent case and are not\\nconvinced that the findings of the district court are clearly erroneous. The State defendants and the intervenor\\nUnited States have persuasively argued that the evidence of record does not demonstrate conditions of\\nconfinement constituting cruel and unusual punishment under the strict standard of Rhodes v. Chapman. See\\n[4]\\nBrief of Defendants-Appellees 2-88; Brief for the United States as Appellee 15-23.\\n1428 *1428 We note one item in particular, the complaint that facilities at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary were not air-\\nconditioned. The complaint concerning the heat was covered by the testimony of Mr. Hutto. The testimony was\\nthat the new housing units at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary were air-conditioned. IV Jt.App. 597. The East and\\nWest Cellhouses were not air-conditioned, but as discussed below, they were vacated, except for limited\\nemergency use, in compliance with the orders of Judge Bohanon.\\nWith respect to the East and West Cellhouses, the May 4, 1979 order of Judge Bohanon was that the State no\\nlonger house inmates at those East and West Cellhouses due to the inadequate facilities there. In the dismissal\\norder of December 30, 1983, the district court noted that the State was not in compliance with that order, but was\\nsatisfied from the assurances of Director Meachum and Governor Nigh that the cellhouses would be vacated as\\nsoon as feasible. X Jt.App. 236.\\nOn May 25, 1985, plaintiffs filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in this court stating that inmates were being\\nhoused in the East and West Cellhouses in violation of the May 4, 1979 order. The State responded to that\\nmotion, representing that the inmates were placed in the cellhouses on May 13, 1985, as the result of a\\ndisturbance at another state prison and that the inmates were removed from these East and West Cellhouses on\\nMay 28. Plaintiffs did not challenge these representations.\\nThere was a further motion for a stay filed December 27, 1985, in which the plaintiffs again represented that\\nsome inmates had been placed into the East and West Cellhouses. However, this was again related to a riot\\nproblem and the defendants informed the plaintiffs' counsel that the forty-three inmates housed in the East\\nCellhouse following the riot were all removed by January 6, 1986. See Response of the United States to\\nAppellants' Motion to Reconsider Order Denying Stay Pending Appeal 3. There was no dispute of those facts\\nconcerning the removal of the inmates from the East Cellhouse after the problem of temporary occupancy. We\\ntherefore conclude that the complaint concerning the East and West Cellhouses is not supported in our record,\\nand we are not persuaded that these temporary emergency uses of the cellhouses should be held a\\nconstitutional violation.\\nIn sum, we are not persuaded by the arguments of the plaintiffs and the evidence that the findings of the district\\ncourt that there was no violation of the Eighth Amendment were clearly erroneous. In addition, we are not\\nconvinced that there was an abuse of discretion by the district court in determining to dismiss the cause as he\\n[5]\\ndid, retaining in force and effect the prior orders and injunctions against constitutional violations.  The majority\\nin Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d at 1537, concluded that \\\"a court should exercise supervisory power over the suit\\nuntil it can say with assurance not only that eighth amendment violations do not presently exist but there is no\\nreasonable expectation that unconstitutional conditions will recur.\\\" In dealing with the various issues before him,\\nthe district judge concluded that he was satisfied that the defendants intended permanent compliance with\\nconstitutional conditions in the Oklahoma prison system. X Jt.App. 232, 234-37. The Memorandum Opinion and\\n\\n1429 Order *1429 stated that \\\"this court finds that it is now satisfied that there is no reasonable expectation that\\nunconstitutional practices will recur in the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system.\\\" Id. at 238.\\nWe are convinced that the district court's conclusion was based on findings supported by the record and that the\\ndetermination to dismiss in these circumstances was not in error or an abuse of discretion.\\nIII\\nAs noted, there was a motion for a stay of the district court's dismissal order filed on May 25, 1985, by the\\nplaintiffs. This court denied that motion, as noted, stating that we would consider the propriety and scope of the\\ndistrict court's December 30, 1983 order of dismissal in our disposition of the pending appeal. On December 27,\\n1985, the plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider that order denying the May 25, 1985 motion for a stay. Because of\\nthe disposition we are making in this opinion, we find that motion now to be moot.\\nIn addition, on February 4, 1986, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial remand for the district court to make an\\nappropriate award of attorney's fees pendente lite. In view of the fact that this court was proceeding to disposition\\nof the case, we have deferred a ruling on that motion. Since we are making a partial remand of the case, the\\nplaintiffs will have the opportunity to have the district court consider a further application of attorney's fees when\\nthose proceedings on remand occur. The trial judge should entertain any such motion with those proceedings.\\nIV\\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated we make the following determinations and order as follows:\\n1. The order of dismissal of December 30, 1983, by the district court, which retained in full force and effect the\\nprevious orders and injunctions protecting the rights of the plaintiffs against constitutional violations, is\\nAFFIRMED except with respect to the claim of racial discrimination discussed in Part II-B of this opinion. The\\nplaintiffs may by further proceedings in the district court seek relief from any violations of those previous orders\\nand injunctions protecting their constitutional rights.\\n2. The order of dismissal of December 30, 1983, is VACATED with respect to the claim of racial discrimination in\\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; as discussed in Part II-B of this opinion,\\nthe cause is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings and the entry of findings and conclusions by\\nthe district court on that constitutional claim as directed by this opinion.\\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\\n[*] The Honorable William E. Doyle heard the argument in this appeal but did not participate after December 31,\\n1985, in this matter.\\n[1] Since the district court held that conditions in the Oklahoma prison system violated the Eighth Amendment's\\nproscription of cruel and unusual punishment in Battle v. Anderson, 376 F.Supp. 402 (E.D.Okla.1974), the\\nlitigation concerning constitutional compliance has been ongoing. See Battle v. Anderson, 447 F.Supp. 516\\n(E.D.Okla.),aff'd,564 F.2d 388 (10th Cir.1977); Battle v. Anderson, 457 F.Supp. 719 (E.D.Okla.1978),remanded\\nfor further hearings,594 F.2d 786 (10th Cir.1979); Battle v. Anderson, 614 F.2d 251 (10th Cir.1980); Battle v.\\nAnderson, 708 F.2d 1523 (10th Cir.1983) (per curiam), cert. dismissed,465 U.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1019, 79\\nL.Ed.2d 248 (1984); see also Battle v. Anderson, 541 F.Supp. 1061 (E.D.Okla.1982) (award of attorneys' fees).\\n[2] The constitutional right of access to the courts has been found to rest on the guarantees of the Due Process\\nClauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. See Ward v. Kort, 762 F.2d 856, 858 (10th Cir.1985).\\n[3] In addition to the inventories of materials at the libraries, we note that the handbook \\\"Civil Procedure for\\nInmate Legal Research Assistants\\\" itself covered basic principles on federal habeas corpus with chapters on the\\nexhaustion doctrine, procedural default, issues cognizable, pleadings, preliminary procedure, and evidentiary\\n\\nhearings. Statutory materials and summaries on various cases from the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals\\non habeas proceedings were also included.\\n[4] The plaintiffs argue that they were denied due process when Chief Judge Seay entered his order of dismissal\\nafter having received only four of seven transcripts of the hearing held earlier before Judge Bohanon. Judge\\nSeay had before him at the time of his dismissal the transcripts of the plaintiffs' entire case in chief, among other\\nthings, and the testimony of Governor Nigh and Director Meachum, and the exhibits were apparently available,\\nincluding those we have cited earlier concerning access to the courts. In addition, in his ruling a few months later\\non the motion to stay his order, which was denied, the judge stated that he had at that time reviewed the entire\\ntranscript of all the proceedings before Judge Bohanon.\\n[5] As noted, the district court here expressly stated that \\\"[a]ll of this court's orders and injunctions as modified\\nheretofore remain in full force and effect.\\\" X Jt.App. 239. This is in accord with the principle that \\\"[i]t has long\\nbeen settled that the court's power to grant injunctive relief survives discontinuance of the illegal conduct. E.g., \\nUnited States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1952).\\\" Battle v. Anderson,\\n708 F.2d at 1538 n. 4. If the district court had intended any dissolution of the prior orders, its order \\\"should have\\ncontained a definite provision for the dissolution\\\" of those provisions. Tucker v. Baker, 185 F.2d 863, 865 (5th\\nCir.1950). We are convinced that it is unmistakenbly clear that the orders and injunctions protecting the inmates\\nagainst constitutional violations, as previously modified, were in no way intended to be relaxed and that they\\nremain in full force and effect.\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar.\\n\\nDocument Title: Opinion\\nDocument Content: \\n564 F.2d 388 (1977)\\nBobby BATTLE, Plaintiff-Appellee,\\nv.\\nPark J.

The State of Oklahoma, following its filing of its\\nNotice of Appeal, moved this court for a stay of the Order of June 14, 1977, which was granted and is yet in force\\nand effect. The appeal and motion for stay were combined for hearing before this court which was held on August\\n23, 1977. The Stay Order has been continued pending disposition of the appeal on the merits.\\nThe genesis of the District Court's Order of June 14, 1977, is a Motion for Emergency Supplemental Relief filed\\nby plaintiff Bobby Battle wherein he alleged \\\"overcrowding\\\" of the inmate population at the state penitentiary. The\\nchallenged Order was entered following full evidentiary hearing. It contains specific findings, inter alia, relative to\\nthe minimum amount of cell space required per prison inmate and, measured thereby, the District Court specially\\nfound that as of the May 23 hearing the Oklahoma prison system contained about 4,600 inmates in a system\\ndesigned for 2,400, constituting an overcrowding situation of 191 percent. In addition to the overcrowding crisis,\\nthe Court found various and sundry physical and environmental conditions existing throughout the system which\\nwere offensive and substandard. The Court specially found that the overcrowding condition had reached such\\nproportions that it constituted a per se unconstitutional condition violative of the Eighth Amendment commands\\nprohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. The Order and Judgment required the State of Oklahoma to achieve\\nspecific goals in the reduction of inmate population commencing August, 1977, more fully hereinafter set forth.\\nOn appeal, the appellant, State of Oklahoma, alleges error on the part of the District Court in that: (1) the\\nevidence does not support a finding that there is a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States\\nConstitution, (2) appellants were denied a fair hearing, (3) findings of fact were erroneously made because the\\n\\ntrial court was misled and unduly swayed by the consideration of inadmissible exhibits and, further, because the\\nfacts were for the most part unsubstantiated by competent testimony of the witnesses, and (4) the court should\\nhave accepted the State's Plan as consented per agreement reached between the State and the appellees.\\nThe seriousness of this matter is recognized by all parties concerned. This court, just as the trial court, is\\ncognizant of the strain placed upon the federal-state relationship. We echo the consistent emphasis of the District\\nCourt relating to its reluctance to usurp or interfere with an area historically within the domain and control of the\\nsovereign states. It is in this context that we must judge whether, from the record before us, there exists such a\\ncompelling interest in the protection of federal constitutional rights that the Order of the District Court must be\\nupheld. A somewhat detailed recital of the factual-procedural background leading to this opinion should help in\\nplacing this difficult case in proper perspective.\\nThe initial complaint alleged civil rights deprivations under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 challenging the Oklahoma State\\n392 Penitentiary and penal system. It was filed by Bobby *392 Battle, pro se, on April 24, 1972, when he was a\\nprisoner at the penitentiary. He complained on behalf of himself and other inmates that they were deprived of\\nrights secured by the federal constitution and civil rights laws. The action sought injunctive relief to correct the\\nclaimed deprivations and to obtain monetary damages. The defendants were various Oklahoma officials\\nperforming duties relating to the state's penal and correctional institutions and system. Upon motion and hearing,\\nthe United States was permitted to intervene on March 5, 1974. The complaint in intervention filed by the United\\nStates alleged that the defendants (the State of Oklahoma, in effect) had discriminated against black inmates in a\\nnumber of instances. The trial of said cause commenced March 14, 1974, and concluded on March 15th. It had\\nbeen preceded by extensive pre-trial discovery including depositions, inspections and investigations conducted\\nby attorneys, FBI agents and experts in penology. The District Court made extensive findings and conclusions\\nleading to its Order, generally finding for the plaintiffs. The Order directed the defendants to undertake certain\\nremedial steps, granting them adequate opportunity within which to comply. Nothing in that proceeding, however,\\ninvolved the general contention of prison inmate overcrowding, per se. The Court did deal with conditions existing\\nin the \\\"solitary confinement\\\" or \\\"the hole\\\" isolation area of the penitentiary, noting that those confined in such\\ndark, unventilated and unsanitary isolation cells were being subjected to intolerable treatment. The Order also\\nreached and disposed of contentions going to racial discrimination and segregation, disciplinary rules,\\npunishment and procedure, administrative lockup, use of chemical agents, medical care, correspondence rights,\\npublications, access to the courts, and religious freedom. In apparent reliance on the rule that a \\u00a7 1983 civil rights\\naction in Federal District Court is supplemental to any other available remedy, no challenge to the federal court's\\njurisdiction has at any time been raised or urged on the grounds of exhaustion of available state remedies or as a\\nmatter of abstention. At oral arguments before this court, counsel for the State of Oklahoma did state belief that\\nsimilar remedies are available to the inmates under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. It was acknowledged,\\nhowever, that at no time or in anywise was the Federal District Court below moved or requested to invoke\\nabstention or exhaustion of available state remedies. At oral argument, counsel for Bobby Battle, et al.,\\ncontended that there are no remedies available under the laws of Oklahoma comparable to the class action\\nremedies which may be compelled in a \\u00a7 1983 proceeding. In any event, it is clear that the parties have acceded\\nto the District Court's jurisdiction throughout these proceedings.\\nThe District Court expressed the reluctance of federal courts to intervene in matters of prison administration, but\\nobserved that the United States Supreme Court had held that a policy of judicial restraint on the part of the\\nfederal courts in refraining from interference with state penal authorities in their administration of a state's penal\\nsystem was not a justifiable basis for failure to take cognizance of valid federal constitutional claims relating to\\nrights secured to inmates by the federal constitution and the laws of the United States. Procunier v. Martinez, 417\\nU.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263\\n(1972); Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969). The District Court retained\\njurisdiction, including that for \\\"determination of all issues not dealt with expressly herein.\\\" The trial court's\\nmemorandum opinion consumed 30 pages, reported as Battle v. Anderson, 376 F.Supp. 402 (1974).\\nWe, too, abhor any situation or circumstance requiring the intervention of the federal courts in matters involving\\nthe administration, control and maintenance by the sovereign states of their penal systems. It is a delicate role\\nassigned to the federal courts to display that restraint so necessary \\\"in the maintenance of proper federal-state\\n393 relations.\\\" Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). We are *393 cognizant of the\\n\\ncomplexity of problems confronting the states in upgrading not only a host of state institutions and facilities but in\\nproperly maintaining them both physically and with adequate personnel. If we were to close our eyes to the\\nfinancial burdens a variety of \\\"piecemeal\\\" federal court orders would impose upon the states and their taxpayers\\nwe would refuse to come to grips with reality. We are in sympathy with the ever increasing budgetary demands\\nupon state taxpayers. There are constitutional and statutory limits on a state's capacity to finance capital outlays.\\nNo one state governmental body is authorized to dictate a specific course of action. The governmental wheels\\noften turn slowly simply as a result of pressure generated by a multitude of needs. Those charged with the\\nadministration of state government must pick and choose, set priorities and goals, many of which must later be\\nabandoned or delayed because of unforeseen emergencies. Thus, it is in recognition of these problems and\\npressures that this court is sincerely reluctant to enter the arena involving the issues presented. The fact is,\\nhowever, that the issues are jurisdictionally before us, just as they were jurisdictionally before the District Court.\\nThey have not been invited or solicited. We are guided by the fact that the United States Supreme Court has not\\nwavered in its holding that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibiting the imposition of\\ncruel and unusual punishment is, inter alia, intended to protect and safeguard a prison inmate from an\\nenvironment where degeneration is probable and self-improvement unlikely because of the conditions existing\\nwhich inflict needless suffering, whether physical or mental. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50\\nL.Ed.2d 251 (1976); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976).\\nThe District Court made particular reference to a serious riot which occurred at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary\\nin 1973 when it entered its Supplemental Order of June 14, 1977, following Plaintiff's Motion for Supplemental\\nRelief as to Crowding:\\nThe conditions which precipitated and caused the disastrous riot of 1973 at McAlester now prevail\\nthroughout the system. In the hearings conducted by the court in 1974 prior to its May 30, 1974\\nOrder (376 F.Supp. 402) the court heard the shocking details of the conditions existing prior to the\\nriot and became convinced that the neglect, apathy and deliberate disregard for human decency\\nand rights contributed directly to the tragic loss of lives and $20 million in state property damages.\\nIt is now equally convinced that the inmate conditions now existing present an immediate and\\nintolerable threat to the safety and security of inmates, prison personnel and the people of the\\nState of Oklahoma with attendant monetary losses and costs of staggering proportions.\\nIn its 1974 opinion in Battle v. Anderson, supra, the District Court noted that during a period of seven months prior\\nto the 1973 riot at the penitentiary the inmate population at the main facility averaged about 1778; that two of the\\ngeneral population cellhouses were constructed in 1907 and the third and fourth units were added in 1932 and\\n1935, providing a design capacity of 1200 inmates.\\nIn its Memorandum Opinion of June 14, 1977, from which this appeal was generated, the Trial Court observed\\nthat the State of Oklahoma made significant progress in many of the concerned areas included in the original\\norder, while failing to do so in other areas; that since the May 30, 1974, order the court had conducted periodic\\nhearings at approximately six month intervals; and that evidence concerning the problem of overcrowding and\\nconditions of confinement was entertained and presented on May 4, 1976, and October 14-15, 1976, and that\\neven though the Court did not issue any orders at those times, \\\"it clearly indicated to the defendants that the then\\nexisting population levels and conditions were intolerable and that the court was considering the issuance of an\\n394 injunction\\\" and \\\"In the interim the problem kept going.\\\" The court found that as of May 23, *394 1977, the State of\\nOklahoma was housing inmates at seven (7) separate facilities totalling 4,600 in facilities with design capacity not\\nin excess of 2,400. Much of this data was obtained from an exhibit constituting a letter from the Director of the\\nOklahoma Department of Corrections dated March 22, 1977. The court observed that it had deferred since May\\n30, 1974, from entering specific orders in the hope that the commended vigorous leadership of Warden Crisp and\\nDirector Benton would, in effect, move the \\\"powers that be\\\" to correct those abuses, but that the court learned in\\nOctober, 1976, that even though the State Board of Corrections in its FY78 Budget had labeled conditions within\\nthe Department a \\\"shame and disgrace\\\" to the State of Oklahoma, the crisis was still such that the physical and\\nmental health of each inmate was impaired. The court found that each resident living in a cell should have a\\nminimum of 60 square feet of sleeping space and each resident of a dormitory should have 75 square feet, as\\nfound by the State Department of Corrections to be the absolute minimum; that certain facilities then in being\\nwere woefully inadequate, rendering treatment of inmates there imprisoned cruel and unusual. The Trial Court\\n\\nlent considerable credibility to the expert testimony of Theodore James Gordon, an environmental health\\nspecialist, Frederick D. Moyer, an architect, and Charles Robert Sarver, a professor of law and sociology and a\\nformer correctional administrator. The court recited in detail the conditions of confinement at each prison facility, i.\\ne., the McAlester complex, Granite, Lexington, Quachita, McLeod and Stringtown. The Court's Conclusions of\\nLaw and Order and Judgment of June 14, 1977, are as follows:\\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\\n1. The Court has the authority and duty to insure that the Constitution does not stop at the prison\\ngate, but rather inures to the benefit of all, even to those citizens behind prison walls, Jackson v.\\nGodwin, 400 F.2d 529, 532 (5th Cir. 1968),Finney v. Arkansas Board of Education [Correction],\\n505 F.2d 194 (8th Cir. 1974).\\n2. In implementing the Constitution, courts have required that certain penal facilities be closed, \\nRhem v. Malcolm, 371 F.Supp. 594 (S.D.N.Y. 1974)aff'd507 F.2d 333 (2nd Cir. 1974),Gates v.\\nCollier, 390 F.Supp. 482 (N.D.Miss. 1974), and Hamilton v. Landrieu, 351 F.Supp. 549 (E.D.La.\\n1972); that inmates be housed in single cells, instead of multiple inmates in a cell, Inmates of\\nSuffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, 360 F.Supp. 676 (D.Mass. 1973)aff'd,494 F.2d 1196 (1st Cir.\\n1974), and Valvano v. Malcolm, 520 F.2d 392 (2nd Cir. 1975) that prison population be limited to a\\nfixed number, e. g., Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, 406 F.Supp. 649 (S.D.Tex. 1975); or that\\ninmates be afforded a fixed minimum amount square footage (see cases cited at conclusion of law\\n6).\\n3. Courts have also evaluated quality of life in penal facilities and demanded a healthy\\nenvironment with adequate sanitation, ventilation, lighting and utilities, Williams v. Edwards, 547\\nF.2d 120 [1206] (5th Cir. 1977); regarding ventilation Rhem v. Malcolm, supra, Hamilton v. Love,\\n328 F.Supp. 1182 (E.D.Ark. 1971) and Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, supra. Vermin\\ninfestations, Miller v. Carson, 401 F.Supp. 835, (M.D.Fla. 1975) and Hamilton v. Landrieu, supra.\\nSee also Rozechi v. Gaughan, 459 F.2d 6 (1st Cir. 1970) and Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 387\\n(M.D.Ala. 1972)aff'd sub nom. Wyatt v. Aderholt, 523 [503] F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1974).\\n4. Courts have grappled with the problems and the conditions of confinement in three ways.\\nConditions have been found to be per se unconstitutional. E. g., Rhem, supra, conditions as\\nexacerbated by overpopulation have found to be unconstitutional, E. g., Williams v. Edwards,\\nsupra, Finney v. Arkansas Board of Corrections, supra, and Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp. 318\\n(M.D.Ala. 1976). Overcrowding per se has been found to be unconstitutional, Gates v. Collier,\\nsupra, McCray v. Sullivan, supra, and Finney v. Arkansas Board of Corrections, supra. This Court\\n395 finds that all three of these *395 cases are existent within the Oklahoma Department of\\nCorrections.\\n5. In the original Order the Court ordered the closing of certain cells at McAlester. Likewise, the\\nwooden facility at Lexington with its severe environmental and fire hazards shocks the Court's\\nconscience and must be closed upon completion of the new Lexington A & R unit.\\n6. The crowding in Oklahoma has reached such proportions that this Court could easily find, as\\nother courts have, that the crowding is per se unconstitutional. Certainly where prisoners are\\nforced to sleep in garages, barber shops, libraries and stairwells; and where they are placed in\\ndormitories without any toilet and shower facilities the crowding has passed the constitutional\\nthreshold. The Court is equally or more offended by the housing of two men within a little 35-40\\nsquare foot \\\"cubbyhole\\\". Such crowding offends the contemporary standards of human decency, \\nTrop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, [78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630] (1958).\\nThe effects of the crowding as it relates to the conditions of confinement with regard to the health,\\nsafety, and security of the inmates is unconstitutional. The crowding has caused the kitchen, water\\nand sewer systems to be overtaxed. The dining facilities, if they were outside the prison walls\\nwould be closed down as immediate health dangers. Individuals are housed in substandard living\\n\\nquarters which are firetraps. However, there is no plan or possibility of putting out the fire if a\\nmajor one occurred.\\nThere is a direct correlation between overcrowding and violence, see finding of fact 16, supra.\\nDefendants acknowledge that the 1973 McAlester riot was caused by the then existing\\novercrowded conditions at the O.S.P. This court would be remiss in its duties if it did not move to\\nact on the problems, but rather sat idly by until the increasing crowding caused another major\\nincident to sweep the Oklahoma Prison system.\\n7. The court adopts the standards of the American Public Health Association for living space and\\nenvironmental matters. APHA calls for 60 square feet in a cell and 75 square feet in a dormitory. In\\nadopting the APHA 60'/75' standards respectively, the Court is mindful that most other\\norganizations and many of the courts who have faced this problem have adopted higher\\nstandards.6\\n6 Organizational standards:\\n70 sq. feet: National Sheriff's Association at 63 (1975)\\n70 sq. feet: Building Officials and Code Administrators, Inc., BOCA Basic Building Code, 1975 \\u00a7\\n201.3\\n70 sq. feet: National Clearinghouse for Criminal Justice Planning and Architecture.\\n75 sq. feet: The American Correctional Association Manual of Correctional Standards 49\\n80 sq. feet: National Advisory Commission for Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Corrections,\\nStandard 11.1, page 353\\n90 sq. feet: The International Conference of Building Officials, Uniform Building Code \\u00a7 1307B, p.\\n83\\nCases:\\n60 sq. feet: Pugh v. Locke, supra.\\n75 sq. feet: Ambrose v. Malcolm, 414 F.Supp. 485 (S.D.N.Y. (1976).\\n88 sq. feet: Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, supra.\\n8. In adopting the APHA environmental standards, the Court points out that a prison facility is a\\nclosed ecosystem. Persons are sent to prison as punishment, not for punishment. It is incumbent\\non the incarcerating body to provide the individual with a healthy habilitative environment.\\nAnything less would be to subject the individual to further punishment than was given by the\\nsentencing trial court. With habilitation assured, then possibly or probably the inmate can decide\\nto rehabilitate himself.\\nBut if the basic habilitative needs of the individual are not met then rehabilitation, reformation or\\nredemption are not possible. Water, fire protection, air and food are necessities of life. Minimum\\nspace to call one's own is a primary psychological necessity. Without the basic minimums prisons\\nare doomed to failure, with both society and the inmates incarcerated therein the losers.\\n9. This Court is well aware of the financial restraints placed on the Defendants and their efforts to\\n396 comply with the *396 Constitution. But the good will shown by the Defendants cannot serve as a\\ndefense. Finney v. Arkansas Board of Correction, supra; Rozechi v. Gaughan, supra; Holt v.\\nSarver, 309 F.Supp. 362, 385 (E.D.Ark., 1972); and Davis v. Lindsay, 321 F.Supp. 1134, 1139\\n(S.D.N.Y., 1970). Nor is the lack of financing a defense to a failure to provide minimum\\nconstitutional standards. Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 580 (8th Cir. 1968); Finney v. Arkansas\\nBoard of Correction, supra at 199; Gates v. Collier, supra, [501 F.2d 1291,] at 1319, 1320 (5th Cir.\\n\\n1974); Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, supra, at 669; and Hamilton v. Love, supra, at 1194. If\\nthe State of Oklahoma wishes to hold the inmates in institutions, it must provide the funds to\\nmaintain the inmates in a constitutionally permissible manner.\\n10. This Court cannot, on the other hand, allow the Defendants to violate the constitutional rights\\nof the Plaintiffs' class and without acting to alleviate the unconstitutional conditions.\\nBased upon the foregoing reasons of unconstitutional confinement of inmates, the Court deems it\\nnecessary to enter the following order to alleviate the unconstitutional treatment of inmates.\\nORDER AND JUDGMENT\\nDefendants are directed to achieve the following goals:\\n(a) Commencing in August, 1977, defendants shall reduce the inmate population at Oklahoma\\nState Penitentiary, McAlester, Oklahoma, at the rate of 100 inmates that month and a like number\\neach succeeding month until the population is reduced to 800 inmates.\\n(b) Commencing in August, 1977, defendants shall reduce the inmate population at the Oklahoma\\nState Reformatory, Granite, Oklahoma, at the rate of 50 inmates that month and a like number\\neach succeeding month until the population is reduced to 450 inmates.\\n(c) The Court does not require the abandonment or discontinued use of any confinement facility at\\nthis time, but within 15 months from the date hereof\\nIn accordance with the trial court's instructions issued on May 24, 1977, the State of Oklahoma submitted to the\\ncourt a proposed plan, as follows:\\nDEFENDANTS' PROPOSED PLAN\\nCome now the defendants above named and in accordance with the Court's instructions issued\\non May 24, 1977, submit the following proposed plan:\\nDefendants, admitting no wrongdoing or violation of any inmate's constitutional rights, submit a\\nsummary of their ongoing plans to the Court to alter the population concentrations existing within\\nthe Oklahoma Department of Corrections. This plan is entered upon with the intent of insuring that\\nno inmate is deprived of his constitutional right. In addition the plan will increase the security within\\nthe institutions and to afford the inmates more opportunity for individualized treatment.\\n1. Within a short time, the Department will open a community treatment center in the Oklahoma\\nCity area with a capacity of up to 100;\\n2. At the beginning of 1978, the Department will open a 400 person Assessment and Reception\\nCenter at Lexington;\\n3. At the beginning of 1978, the Department will establish two additional community treatment\\ncenter with a capacity of up to 100 for each center, enabling more than half of the prisoners\\nreleased from the system to undergo several months of work release programming;\\n4. In the spring of 1978, the Department will open another 400 person institution at Lexington;\\n5. In the spring and summer of 1978, the Department will open 450 bed spaces within housing\\nunits to be constructed, two at Stringtown, two at Quachita, and one at McLeod;\\n6. Early in 1978, the Department will open a 120 person institution at Sulphur for women;\\n7. Immediate implementation of new procedures for parole docketing and new criteria for parole\\n397 consideration will enable *397 a larger number of qualified inmates to see the Pardon and Parole\\nBoard.\\n\\n8. The Department will continue their plan to upgrade utilities in the prison system. This plan will\\nbe accelerated by a $300,000 appropriation currently under consideration by the Legislature;\\n9. Funds have been appropriated or are committed for new construction and facility acquisition\\nwhich will result in development of entirely new bed space during the next 18 months as follows:\\nOklahoma City Community\\n  Treatment Center                        100\\nTwo additional community\\n  treatment centers                       200\\nHodgens housing units                     150\\nMcLeod housing units                      100\\nStringtown housing units                  200\\nLexington Assessment and\\n  Reception Center                        400\\nLexington Correctional Center             400\\nHominy Correctional Center                400\\nSulphur Women's Facility                  120\\n                                           _____\\nTOTAL NEW BED SPACE:                       2,070\\n10. On or before January 1, 1979, each inmate under the Department of Corrections shall have a\\nminimum of 60 square feet in a room, cell, or dorm. The only exception shall be within the walls at\\nthe Penitentiary and the Reformatory where no more than one man will be housed per cell, except\\nin the large cells in the F-cellhouse at the Penitentiary where two inmates will be permitted to\\noccupy each cell.\\nThe State of Oklahoma filed a Notice of Appeal from the Trial Court's Order of June 14, 1977, and in conjunction\\ntherewith moved the Trial Court for an order staying enforcement of that Order and any further proceedings\\npending appeal. The motion for stay was denied by the district court on July 5, 1977, after consideration of and\\ndetailed recitals directed to the criteria to be considered and treated governing the propriety of a stay order\\npending an appeal, as follows: (1) whether the appellant has made strong showing that he is likely to prevail on\\nthe merits of the appeal, (2) whether the appellant has shown irreparable injury if the stay is not granted, (3)\\nwhether a stay will substantially harm the other parties to the litigation, and (4) where the public interests lie. In\\ntreating these tests leading to the denial of the Motion for Stay, the Trial Court found:\\nThe defendants made certain conclusory allegations in their Application that there is a substantial\\nlikelihood that they will prevail on appeal. They cite no cases or other law to show that they have\\nany likelihood of success at all. To put the appeal in proper perspective it is necessary to\\nremember what this appeal is really about. It really does not relate to the merits of the case but\\nonly to what relief the Court should afford the plaintiffs' class. Unconstitutional conditions now, and\\nfor a long time, have prevailed in the Oklahoma State penal system. This was judicially\\ndetermined by the Court in its May 30, 1974 Order herein. 376 F.Supp. 402. That Order was not\\nappealed by defendants and is unchallenged today. It is undenied that the overcrowded conditions\\nwhich were the focus of the May, 1977, hearings amount to cruel and unusual punishment. There\\n\\nis no evidence to the contrary and counsel for the defendants has never seriously argued to the\\ncontrary.\\nSince the unconstitutionality of the conditions is undisputed the only real question is how much\\nlonger plaintiffs' class must endure their constitutional deprivations. Given the history of the case\\nand the magnitude of the violations this Court believes that it is improbable that any court would\\nconclude that it is arbitrary and capricious to grant immediate relief to the victims who are helpless\\nand who are now suffering the cruel and unusual punishment which is now being imposed by the\\ndefendants by virtue of the unconstitutional conditions.\\nIn their Application the defendants further claim irreparable harm because the Order allegedly\\nmandates \\\"transfers, paroles, releases, or restrictions by [state] District Judges against\\n398 confinement of convicted felons, without due regard for *398 the safety of the general public and\\nthe employees and officers of the institutions of the State of Oklahoma and the health and well-\\nbeing of the inmates incarcerated therein.\\\" This is an extravagant and unsupported statement.\\nThe Court mandated only the reduction in population levels at the two institutions. It did not\\npurport to dictate or mandate the means by which the defendants can accomplish the established\\ngoals. Similarly, defendants allege \\\"the Court has adopted a posture of administering the\\nOklahoma Correctional System in abuse of its constitutional authority and jurisdiction.\\\" The Court\\nhas only decreed that the overcrowded conditions in the two particular facilities must be eliminated\\nwithin a prescribed time period. The details and administration of a program are left solely to the\\ndiscretion of the defendants. The Court is interested in ends and not means so long as they are\\nlawful. Defendant further contends that the Order \\\"will unduly disrupt the orderly operation of the\\npenal institutions of the State of Oklahoma.\\\" This presumes that the prolongation of the\\nunconstitutional conditions is essential to the \\\"orderly operation\\\" of the system. The Court rejects\\nthe idea that constitutionality is incompatible with orderliness and that a constitutional operation is\\nby definition disorderly. Defendants also raise the fear that the Order may result in the premature\\nrelease of inmates. This fear should be abandoned. The Order specifically provides that no inmate\\nshall be prematurely released; that the defendant may apply for a release of the timely schedule of\\ndepopulation of the two institutions at any time.\\nThe Order itself has a built-in safeguard to permit the defendants to avoid any irreparable injury.\\nAll that is required of the defendants is that they undertake in August, 1977, and each succeeding\\nmonth thereafter, in good faith, and with due diligence, an attempt to comply with the schedule in\\nthe Order. If they do so, \\\"with all the means and resources available to them,\\\" the Court expects\\nand demands no more. If the threat of irreparable injury becomes real rather than speculative, the\\ndefendants may apply to the Court for temporary relief and delay. By its terms the Order does not\\ndecree the impossible and does protect the free majority. If the defendants will avail themselves, if\\nnecessary, of this provision of the Order and make the required showing of impossibility or\\n\\\"demonstrably dangerous\\\" threat, defendants can avoid any irreparable harm. Defendants should\\nnot object to being required to demonstrate rather than merely imagine the consequences of\\nimplementing the schedule.\\nThe third burden which defendants have in order to justify a stay is to show that no substantial\\nharm will come to the other interested parties if the stay is granted. North Central Truck Lines,\\nInc., v. United States, 384 F.Supp. 1188 (W.D.Mo.1974), aff'd., 420 U.S. 901 [95 S.Ct. 820, 42\\nL.Ed.2d 832.] The defendants largely ignore this requirement. The evidence of existing\\nenvironmental health and safety problems in the system is overwhelming. There is no doubt that\\nthe overcrowding increases the incident of both infectious communicable diseases (e. g., flu,\\nhepatitis, tuberculosis, etc.,) and stress related diseases (e. g., rashes, asthma, hypertension,\\netc.). Defendants offer no assurances that in the do-nothing interim requested by them, that\\ninmate fatalities or permanent impairment of the physical and mental health of inmates will not\\nresult from these causes. It is a harsh thing to say that the lives and health of inmates must be\\nsacrificed to the administrative convenience of the defendants.\\n\\nFinally, where does the public interest lie? This is never an easy question to resolve. It is\\nespecially difficult in this type of case, where the plaintiffs' class are generally a feared and\\ndespised class. Frequently the issue is confused by the political posturing of public officials. The\\nCourt does not purport to be an oracle, able to foresee the future with a clear vision, but it does\\n399 know that in July *399 1973 a public disaster occurred at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\nMcAlester. Lives were lost. It cost the public many millions of dollars of property destroyed by fire\\nand the public is still paying a high price for the actions and neglect of defendants' predecessors.\\nFrom the complex of factors involved, the overriding cause must be ascribed to the inhuman and\\nunconstitutional conditions which then prevailed. This is not to justify the riots, but only to state a\\nfact. Similar conditions now exist. The public interest obviously would be badly served by a repeat\\nof that catastrophe. The risk of a stay is very great. If, however, the Order is properly executed the\\nrisk is greatly reduced. The Court has not required or ordered the premature release of any\\nprisoner. The defendants must exercise their expertise and good judgment in the matter of\\nprisoner release. The Court has to believe that in the immediate as well as in the long run the\\npublic interest in best served by adherence to the Constitution and the protection of the rights of\\nall helpless human beings.\\nAs evidenced by the foregoing analysis the defendants have failed to make a strong showing that\\nsuccess on the merits of the appeal is likely, that unless a stay is granted irreparable harm will\\nresult; that no substantial harm will come to the plaintiffs' class; that granting of the stay will do no\\nharm to the public interest. Therefore the Application for Stay should be denied.\\nThereafter, on July 20, 1977, the State of Oklahoma filed with this court a Motion for Stay, invoking the provisions\\nof Rule 8 of the Fed.Rules of Appellate Proc., 28 U.S.C.A. That Motion was granted and has been subsequently\\nextended and continued to date. The contentions raised in relation thereto are considered by this court as part\\nand parcel of the issues on the merits to be decided on appeal. In the Motion for Stay the State of Oklahoma\\nalleges, inter alia, that (a) the subject order requires the transfer of inmates to less secure institutions within the\\nsystem, (b) the State of Oklahoma has previously presented the trial court with a plan for accomplishing the\\norderly reduction in inmate population at certain institutions, increasing the capacity at other institutions as well as\\npurchasing and constructing new facilities, (c) the aforesaid plan or program has been funded and approved by\\nthe Governor and the State Legislature of the State of Oklahoma and mutually agreed to by all of the parties, and\\n(d) that if this court fails to stay the Order, the State of Oklahoma must choose between two unacceptable\\nactions: first, order inmates transferred to other institutions which have less security, or operating with greater\\npopulations than are desirable, place violent and passive inmates in close association, reduce supervision,\\nincrease the likelihood of escape and subject the citizens of Oklahoma to increased danger, or, second, to follow\\nall the recognized practices of accepted penology, protect the lives and rights of employees, inmates and\\ncitizens, but to incur the legal contempt of the court. Finally, the State of Oklahoma points out that the movement\\nof inmates necessitates staff transfers, budgetary changes, construction of additional facilities, contracts and\\nbidding procedures which must follow state laws, and numerous other administrative problems which require\\nseveral months of advanced planning to accomplish, which has, in fact, been considered and incorporated into\\nthe State's plan for new institutions, as well as the reduction of inmate population at the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary and the Oklahoma State Reformatory. The State of Oklahoma complains that Battle, et al., and the\\nUnited States, as intervenor, presented \\\"absolutely no evidence concerning medical problems, increased\\nviolence level, brutality, use of trustee guards, inadequate food and clothing or an excessive amount of time\\nspent in cells\\\" while acknowledging that \\\"the testimony concerning these critical areas was solicited on cross-\\nexamination from the defendants, Director Benton and Warden Crisp.\\\" [Brief of Defendants-Appellants, p. 10.]\\n400 Such does not support the contention that the trial court was without *400 substantial evidence to support its\\nfindings. The record indicates otherwise. Nor are we impressed with the State of Oklahoma's contention that the\\nTrial Court denied it a fair hearing or that the court was \\\"misled and unduly swayed\\\" by its consideration of\\nalleged inadmissible exhibits and unsubstantiated facts. As to the \\\"fair hearing\\\" contention, the record establishes\\nthat even though proper notice was submitted by the court, the State of Oklahoma did not request a pre-trial\\nconference or any request of the court to obtain a list of witnesses or other matters. [R., Vol. I, pp. 8-11.] While\\nthe entire record does indeed reflect that certain hearsay and/or questionable exhibits (from an evidentiary point\\nof view) were presented, there is nothing indicating that they \\\"misled or unduly swayed\\\" the Trial Court or even\\n\\nthat the Trial Court in fact relied upon them. We observe that even though the \\\"foundation\\\" challenges to certain\\nexhibits are not without substance, there is no doubt from the record that most of them were in fact documents\\nprepared by agencies and/or departments of the State of Oklahoma. [For example, see Vol. I, pp. 254-265.]\\nWe are satisfied that the State of Oklahoma has, since the 1973 disastrous riot, made significant progress in\\nupgrading its penal system. The State contends that the 1974 Oklahoma Legislature appropriated\\n$16,285,090.00 to the penal system, representing an increase of 46.9% over the previous year; that the 1976\\nLegislature appropriated $44,000,000.00, an increase of 534% over the 1973 appropriation. There can be no\\ndoubt that the State of Oklahoma has, as the District Court acknowledged, made significant strides and efforts to\\nremedy the serious deficiencies. Even so, the Court's finding that the presently existing overcrowding condition at\\nthe two facilities, when considered with other circumstances, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is not\\nclearly erroneous. We hold that there is substantial evidence supporting the finding. It was made, to be sure,\\nnotwithstanding the comprehensive Plan prepared and submitted to the Court by the State of Oklahoma and\\napproved by all parties to this litigation. That Plan established a priority goal by the State in the commitment of its\\nfiscal and administrative resources to expeditiously upgrade its entire penal-correctional system. We commend\\nthe State of Oklahoma and its people for the actions taken. Even so, we must hold that the Trial Court did not err\\nin its order here challenged. We cannot, on the basis of the record before us, arbitrarily substitute our judgment\\nfor that of the resident federal district judge who has given so much of his time, conscience and effort to this on-\\ngoing case. His concern for the protection of the constitutional rights of the inmates goes to the \\\"heart\\\" of their\\nphysical and mental well being. We believe that the Trial Court has endeavored to diligently accommodate the\\nconcurrent problems confronting the State of Oklahoma. We agree with the District Court that the exigencies\\nweigh in favor of the inmates.\\nWe have carefully considered the State of Oklahoma's request for the additional time required to effectuate its\\ncomprehensive Plan which the State deems necessary in order to fashion a solid basis for future planning and\\nadministration of the state's penal system. In relation to the Stay Order, the State of Oklahoma alleges that the\\nTrial Court has mandated an arbitrary reduction of the inmate population with fixed schedules in the face of a\\nreasonable and feasible State plan already adopted and designed to remove the conditions complained of which\\nhas met with the consent of all of the parties. The State of Oklahoma does not challenge or dispute the fact of\\novercrowding at the two penal facilities affected by the reduction order, but it does emphatically argue that those\\nconditions are not such as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\\nDuring oral argument, counsel for the State of Oklahoma emphasized that the record simply does not support the\\nTrial Court's findings that the inmates at the two affected facilities are being subjected to cruel and unusual\\npunishment. On the contrary, it was contended that they are not in anywise ill treated.\\n401 *401 Bobby Battle, et al. (the inmate class), by and through the American Civil Liberties Union, have resisted the\\nMotion for Stay, pointing to the uncontroverted facts of overcrowding and the intolerable conditions of\\nconfinement found by the Trial Court to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Battle contends that the facts\\nfound are not denied by the State of Oklahoma and that the \\\"defendants totally ignore the danger which these\\npractices [overcrowding in cells, inadequate ventilation, fire protection and sanitation] place the inmate population\\nin.\\\" Battle argues that the Trial Court's order was issued after careful, deliberate proceedings and consideration,\\non the basis of overwhelming evidence of unconstitutional prison conditions. Further, Battle alleges that the State\\nof Oklahoma is not entitled to a stay simply because it must go to some extra effort in order to comply. Battle\\nargues that the State fails on each of the four factors this Court must consider in granting the requested stay: (1)\\nwhether the State has made a strong showing that it is likely to prevail on the merits of the appeal, (2) whether\\nthe State has shown irreparable injury if the stay is not granted, (3) whether a stay will substantially harm the\\nother parties to the litigation, and (4) where the public interest lies. Battle contends that the State of Oklahoma\\nhas virtually ignored these requirements.\\nThe United States of America, as Plaintiff Intervenor, by and through the Attorney General, Department of Justice,\\nhas moved to deny State's Motion for Stay, alleging, inter alia, that the State of Oklahoma has not specifically\\naddressed itself to the four (4) elements of the criteria above referred to in determining the propriety of a stay\\norder pending compliance with the Plan. Furthermore, the United States argues that even had the State done so,\\nit could not have prevailed in the face of the continuation of physical conditions and practices at the two\\ninstitutions which the District Court found to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in relation to the inmate\\n\\npopulation. The United States urges that the stay be denied in that the continuation of the intolerable conditions\\nwill require inmates to suffer substantial harm by being forced to live in less than 20 square feet and to be housed\\nin facilities which are unfit for human habitation. Further, the United States argues that the State's Plan,\\nconsented to by the parties, was not submitted at or during any of the three hearings dealing with the issue of\\novercrowding and that, in fact, the Plan was not written until after the trial court's May 24, 1977, bench ruling and\\nwas not presented to the parties until June 13, 1977. The record confirms this contention. The United States also\\nalleges that the inmate reduction order was orally communicated by the Court on May 24, 1977 and that the\\nparties were directed to confer upon the timetable, knowing that the Court was considering a range of 90 to 180\\ndays. Again, the record bears this out. [R., Vol. I, p. 282.] However, the United States does agree that the parties\\ndid present to the Court a draft order which contained the Plan's recommended construction timetable, but which\\ndid not deal with either the numerical or time limitations ordered by the Trial Court from the bench. Accordingly,\\nthe United States contends that the Trial Court's order requiring a reduction of inmate population on a timetable\\nbasis is clearly within the equitable power of the Court and a matter directly addressed by the Court at the\\nconclusion of the May 24, 1977 hearing.\\nDISPOSITION\\nWe hold that the challenged Order of the District Court is supported by substantial evidence. We direct that the\\nStay Order Pending Appeal entered by this Court as thereafter extended and continued, be and the same is\\nhereby vacated.\\nWe hold that the Trial Court's finding that the overcrowding inmate population at the two subject Oklahoma\\ninstitutions constitutes cruel and unusual punishment proscribed under the Eighth Amendment to the United\\nStates Constitution, is supported by substantial evidence. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50\\n402 L.Ed.2d 251,supra. In that case the Court held that a state prisoner's civil rights complaint *402 lodged under 42\\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment for inadequate treatment of a back\\ninjury while engaged in work in the Texas penitentiary must be entertained, and that deliberate indifference by\\nprison personnel to a prisoner's serious injury or illness constitutes cruel and unusual punishment contravening\\nthe Eighth Amendment. The court there reviewed the history of the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual\\npunishment. It noted that the primary concern of the constitutional drafters was to proscribe \\\"tortures\\\" and other\\n\\\"barbarous\\\" methods of punishment. The court then related:\\nOur more recent cases, however, have held that the Amendment proscribes more than physically\\nbarbarous punishments. See, e. g., Gregg v. Georgia, supra [428 U.S. 153] at 171, [96 S.Ct. 2909\\nat 2924] (plurality opinion); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-101, [78 S.Ct. 590, 597, 598, 2\\nL.Ed.2d 630] (1958); Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 373 [30 S.Ct. 544, 551, 54 L.Ed.\\n793] (1910).

Utah, supra, [996 U.S. 130] at 136, [25\\nL.Ed. 345].\\nThese elementary principles establish the government's obligation to provide medical care for\\nthose whom it is punishing by incarceration. An inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his\\nmedical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met. In the worst cases, such\\na failure may actually produce physical \\\"torture or a lingering death,\\\" In re Kemmler [136 U.S. 436,\\n10 S.Ct. 930, 34 L.Ed. 519,] supra, the evils of most immediate concern to the drafters of the\\nAmendment.

Georgia, supra, [428 U.S.\\n153] at 171-74, [96 S.Ct. 2909 at 2924-25] (plurality opinion). The infliction of such unnecessary\\nsuffering is inconsistent with contemporary standards of decency as manifested in modern\\nlegislation codifying the commonlaw view that \\\"[i]t is but just that the public be required to care for\\nthe prisoner, who cannot, by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, care for himself.\\\"\\nIn Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) the Supreme Court stated, inter alia:\\nOf course, the requirements of the Eighth Amendment must be applied with an awareness of the\\nlimited role to be played by the courts. This does not mean that judges have no role to play, for the\\nEighth Amendment is a restraint upon the exercise of legislative power.\\n\\\"Judicial review, by definition, often involves a conflict between judicial and legislative judgment as\\nto what the Constitution means or requires. In this respect, Eighth Amendment cases come to us\\nin no different posture.

Georgia, 408 U.S. [238]\\nat 313-314, [92 S.Ct. 2706, 2825, 33 L.Ed.2d 346] (White, J. concurring.)\\n428 U.S. at p. 174, 96 S.Ct., at p. 2925.\\n403 *403 It is the obligation of the federal courts to be ever alert not to intrude into the affairs of state prison\\nadministration unless there is displayed a clear failure by the State to take cognizance of an inmate's valid federal\\nconstitutional rights. We are satisfied that in the instant case neither this court nor the District Court has interfered\\nwith matters in the sole discretion of state officials. We believe that while an inmate does not have a federal\\nconstitutional right to rehabilitation, he is entitled to be confined in an environment which does not result in his\\ndegeneration or which threatens his mental and physical well being.\\nThe State of Oklahoma argues that if this Court affirms the Trial Court's order and if the inmates are transferred to\\nother institutions \\\"which have less security, or operating with greater populations than are desirable\\\" that such\\naction will place violent and passive inmates in close association, reduce supervision, increase the likelihood of\\nescape and subject the people of Oklahoma to increased danger. We would wish such risks away if wishing\\nserved the purpose. We agree with the Trial Court finding, that while the State of Oklahoma has made significant\\nprogress in correcting many of the abuses and/or providing for new or additional facilities, personnel and\\nprograms within its penal system, still the State has not prevented the degenerated overcrowding conditions\\nwhich have come to pass at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester and at the Oklahoma State\\nReformatory at Granite. The transfer of the inmates as ordered by the Trial Court is, of course, subject to change\\nor modification if the District Court deems such action necessary and proper in the future. Viewing the facts and\\ncircumstances contained in the record in their totality, we hold that the Order here challenged must be affirmed.\\nWhile neither this Court nor the District Court holds to the proposition that prisoners subjected to the punishment\\nof incarceration are entitled to the rights and privileges of one who has not committed a crime against person or\\nproperty crying out for retribution, still the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment cannot be countenanced in\\nan orderly society. While the rights and privileges necessarily lost 00 and, in effect, surrendered 00 by prisoners in\\n97 97\\npunishment for crimes committed are many and varied, they cannot be denied all rights and privileges.

The\\ncomplaint seeks injunctive relief, on behalf of all members of the plaintiff class, to remedy the alleged misconduct\\nof the defendants as well as monetary damages for plaintiff Battle.\\nNamed as defendants were Leo McCracken, Director of Corrections, Park J. Anderson, Warden, and Sam C.\\nJohnston, Deputy Warden of the State Penitentiary at McAlester. Since the commencement of this action, Leo\\nMcCracken has been replaced by John Grider, who now serves as Acting Director of Corrections, and Park J.\\nAnderson has been replaced by Sam C. Johnston, who now serves as Acting Warden of the State Penitentiary at\\nMcAlester, and Mr. Pete Douglas has replaced Sam C. Johnston as Acting Deputy Warden. Mr. Roy Sprinkle,\\nDeputy Director of Corrections in charge of Institutions, Captain Black, Danny Nace and Otis Campbell,\\nCorrectional Officers at the State Penitentiary, have been added as defendants.\\nOn March 15, 1973, the late Judge Edwin Langley granted the United States' Motion to Intervene pursuant to\\nTitle IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000h-2. The complaint in intervention alleged segregation by\\nrace in housing assignments and certain other aspects of penitentiary operations.\\n\\nOn March 5, 1974, the Court granted the United States' motion to amend its complaint in intervention which now\\nalleges, in addition to the allegations of the original complaint in intervention, that the defendants have\\ndiscriminated against black inmates in making job assignments and in the operation of the penitentiary\\ndisciplinary system; and that they have, with regard to all inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, without\\nregard to race, subjected them to disciplinary procedures and taken disciplinary action against them without\\nproviding due process of law; subjected those inmates in disciplinary segregation to cruel and unusual\\n408 punishment by depriving them of food, clothing, bedding, light and necessary *408 personal hygiene items;\\nplaced inmates in non-disciplinary administrative segregation without providing them with due process of law and\\nsubjected them to unreasonable conditions of confinement; inflicted upon inmates summary punishment without\\ndue process of law and cruel and unusual punishment by the use of chemical agents, including mace and tear\\ngas; inflicted upon inmates cruel and unusual punishment by maintaining and operating a medical care delivery\\nsystem that is incapable of providing and has failed to provide adequate medical care; imposed upon inmates\\narbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on mailing privileges, including censorship and rejection of mail to and\\nfrom attorneys, courts, government officials, family members and religious ministers; refused inmates the right to\\nsubscribe to or receive personal legal reference materials, as well as certain other periodicals; and denied\\ninmates adequate access to the courts by failing to provide an adequate law library or any reasonable and\\nadequate alternative thereto and by specifically refusing to permit inmates to have in their possession any\\npersonal legal reference materials or to assist each other on legal problems.\\nThe parties have conducted extensive pretrial discovery consisting of depositions, inspections and investigations\\nconducted by attorneys, FBI agents and experts in penology.\\nAt the final pretrial conference held on March 4, 1974, counsel orally stipulated and agreed and the court ordered\\nthat all depositions taken prior to trial be admitted into evidence and made a part of the record.\\nTrial on the merits was heard at McAlester, Oklahoma, on March 14 and 15, 1974. At the outset, counsel for all\\nparties stipulated and agreed to the authenticity of copies of documents marked exhibits 1 through 161 and\\ncontained in 18 bound volumes previously tendered to counsel and the court by the United States. It was further\\nstipulated and agreed and the court ordered that the said exhibits be admitted into evidence and made a part of\\nthe record in this case.\\nUpon the basis of the depositions and exhibits and the oral testimony heard at the trial of this case and the cases\\nof Holland et al. v. Anderson (No. 73-324) heard on March 12, 1974, and the consolidated cases of Barnett et al.\\nv. Hall (No. 73-237), Johnson v. Anderson (No. 74-8), Barnett et al. v. Pontesso (No. 70-97) and Johnson et al. v.\\nAnderson (No. 72-90) heard on March 13, 1974, the court makes its findings of fact and conclusions of law as\\nfollows:\\nFindings of Fact\\n1. The Oklahoma State Penitentiary system consists of a main maximum security facility at McAlester and\\nseveral subsidiary institutions located at McAlester and other locations throughout the southeastern and western\\nportion of Oklahoma. These subsidiaries include a dual unit women's ward and a male trusty unit which are also\\nlocated at McAlester; a medium security vocational training school located at Stringtown, Oklahoma, about 40\\nmiles south of McAlester; a smaller minimum security facility for vocational training located near Hodgens,\\nOklahoma; and an Honor farm near Farris, Oklahoma.\\n2. The Oklahoma State Penitentiary System was established by law for the purpose of housing persons\\ncommitted to the custody of the Department of Corrections under the administrative direction and control of the\\nDivision of Institutions, Title 57 O.S.A. \\u00a7 509.\\n3. The Board of Corrections, composed of seven members appointed by the Governor, appoints the Director of\\nthe Department of Corrections. The Board has statutory authority to establish policies for the operation of the\\nDepartment. Title 57 O.S.A. \\u00a7\\u00a7 503, 504. The Director of the Department of Corrections is vested by statute with\\nthe authority and responsibility for the operation of all facilities within the department, for prescribing rules\\n\\n409 pertaining to the management of said institutions *409 and for the control, care and treatment of inmates\\nremanded to the custody of the Department of Corrections. Title 57 O.S.A. \\u00a7\\u00a7 507 and 510. Such rules, when\\nreduced to writing, are customarily promulgated in the form of departmental policy statements, but may also be\\nissued in the form of operations memoranda.\\nThe Deputy Director of Corrections in charge of Institutions is appointed by the Director and is charged with the\\nadministrative responsibility for the operation of all facilities within the Department of Corrections. Title 57 O.S.A.\\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 508, 509.\\nThe Warden of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester is vested by statute with the responsibility for\\nperforming all duties pertaining to the penitentiary as are fixed by the Director of Corrections. Title 57 O.S.A. \\u00a7\\n510. The established duties of the Warden include supervisory responsibility for the government and operation of\\nthe Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester, Oklahoma, and its subsidiary units. Written rules issued pursuant\\nto the authority of the Warden are promulgated in the form of memoranda, directives, etc.\\n4. All persons convicted of felonies and sentenced by duly constituted courts of the State of Oklahoma to a term\\nof imprisonment which is not to be served in a county jail are committed to the custody of the Oklahoma\\nDepartment of Corrections to be confined in one of the facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Department. Title\\n57 O.S.A. \\u00a7 521.\\n5. Between January, 1970 and July 27, 1973, the total population in the penitentiary system averaged about\\n2,990 male and 120 female inmates. The largest concentration of inmates in the system was \\\"behind the walls\\\" at\\nthe main facility at McAlester.\\n6. On July 27, 1973, a riot occurred at the McAlester facility which resulted in the destruction of some physical\\nfacilities and damage to others. Following the riot, many programs, procedures, practices and operations that had\\nbeen in effect at the penitentiary were either eliminated or curtailed. The general inmate population was placed\\non a twenty-four-hour lockdown which continued with only minor modifications at the time of the trial in this case.\\nNumerous examples could be cited from the record of practices and conditions which were justified as\\nemergency measures in the immediate aftermath of the riot and even for some time thereafter, but which were\\nstill in substantial effect at the time of the trial of this case, long after their justification had ended.\\n7. During the 7 months of 1973 prior to the riot, the inmate population at the main facility averaged about 1778 or\\n57% of the total penitentiary population. The racial composition of the population at the main facility averaged\\n29.5% Black and 70.5% non-Black inmates. Many of these inmates were transferred to subsidiary institutions and\\nto municipal and county holding facilities and commitments to McAlester were suspended following the riot. The\\npopulation at McAlester dropped to 1338 in August 1973, and after several additional reductions has leveled off\\nat approximately 900 inmates since the first of this year.\\n8. Prior to the riot, the facilities at the main penitentiary consisted of an administration building, four general\\npopulation cellhouses and a mess hall radiating from a central rotunda, a maximum security unit and combination\\nhospital-gymnasium and a series of industrial and maintenance buildings, some of which were located in the\\n\\\"industrial area\\\" north of the main walls. Two of the general population cellhouses were constructed in 1907. The\\nthird and fourth units were added in 1932 and 1935. The design capacity of the penitentiary was approximately\\n1,200.\\n9. The civilian staff level of about 350 at the main McAlester facility has remained fairly constant. Out of this total\\ncivilian staff, about 242 have been employed as security personnel holding the rank of Correctional Officer I\\n410 (about 160 men); Correctional Officer *410 II (about 65 men); Correctional Officer III or Lieutenant (about 11\\nmen); and Correctional Officer IV or Captain (about 6 men). Under the normal conditions as they existed before\\nthe riot, the security staff provided 24 hour, 7 day a week supervision and surveillance over the cellhouses,\\nlockup areas, guard towers and hospital complex. The staff also provided daytime supervision and surveillance\\nover the work areas (industrial, maintenance and administrative), the yard and special inmate work gangs. They\\nalso supplied the supervision required for the transfer of inmates to other Oklahoma penal facilities, to outside\\nmedical facilities and to the courts. Their post-riot activities have generally consisted of carrying out such security\\nfunctions as were deemed necessary, from time to time, by penitentiary authorities.\\n\\n10. The security force at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester is understaffed and spread far too thin.\\nThe continuing deficiencies in needed personnel have been at least 30 to 35 percent less than the level required\\nto maintain adequate supervision and control. This limited staff is inadequately trained and poorly supervised.\\nThere is a high turnover among correctional officers; the monthly rate reaching 8 to 9 percent, particularly among\\nlower echelon security personnel. Proper training may well be impossible with this shortage of personnel\\naccompanied by such a continuing turnover rate.\\nThe available security force is simply inadequate to maintain proper order and carry on even minimally effective\\ncorrections operations. Staffing deficiencies have been a causative factor in the conditions which existed and still\\nexist at the penitentiary. The level of violence inside the penitentiary has been alarming. From January 1970 until\\nJuly 27, 1973, defendants' own records reflect a total of 19 violent deaths. In addition, there were 40 stabbings\\nand 44 serious beatings of inmates. Some of the violence occurred in the cellhouses where frequently only one\\nguard was available for an entire cellhouse. Some violence occurred on the prison yard where frequently only\\none or two guards were available to supervise and control the entire general population.\\n11. Since the riot, lack of adequate security has been used continously as an excuse for the confinement of the\\nmajority of inmates in their cells 24 hours a day, in complete idleness and without any form of exercise or other\\nrecreation. As previously indicated, this massive and almost total lockdown has continued for over 8 months, with\\nthe limited exception that inmates not confined in disciplinary maximum security have recently been granted the\\nmeager privilege of eating one or two meals in the mess hall every other day provided adequate security is\\navailable. Only a limited number of inmates are regularly permitted out of their cells to perform penitentiary\\nmaintenance and housekeeping chores such as preparing food and repairing or maintaining the physical\\ncomplex.\\nRacial Discrimination and Segregation\\n12. Prior to the July riot, the policy and practice at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary was to maintain a prison\\nsystem segregated by race and by means of which black inmates were subjected to discriminatory and unequal\\ntreatment. Except for the maximum security unit, where inmates under disciplinary punishment were confined in\\nsingle cells, all inmates were routinely assigned to housing units on the basis of race. The reception center, the\\nmess hall, the recreation yard and barber facilities were racially segregated. Black inmates were discriminated\\nagainst in job assignments and were subjected to more frequent and disparate punishment than white inmates.\\nThe guard force was and remains predominantly white. A policy statement issued by the Department of\\nCorrections on October 20, 1972, declared the official departmental policy to be that all of its correctional facilities\\nwould be integrated in order to insure equal rights and equal opportunity to all persons confined therein. This\\n411 policy *411 statement also directed correctional administrators to formulate, implement and follow up procedures\\nto insure that discrimination did not occur in practice. The need to increase minority personnel at every level was\\nmade clear and it was suggested that each correctional facility appoint an official to be directly responsible for\\nsupervising the recruitment and fair treatment of minority employees. A departmental operations memorandum\\nissued on the same date set forth specific requirements for the implementation of the departmental policy\\nstatement. Wardens at each state penal facility were directed to prepare plans for complete integration, to take\\nimmediate action to inform and instruct all employees regarding the official policy on racial segregation and of\\ntheir obligations thereunder, to implement an objective and fair classification system for inmates with respect to\\nall aspects of institutional life, to inform the inmates of the racial segregation policy, and to make telephonic\\nprogress reports each Monday morning to the Deputy Director of Institutions or the Director of the Department of\\nCorrections detailing the percentages of integration at each location and any major problems encountered. Both\\nthe policy statement and accompanying operations memorandum were completely ignored by the Warden at the\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester. Racial segregation, as had been practiced prior to the issuance of\\nthese directives, continued unabated. Not until the July riot did any noticeable changes occur. Only at that time,\\noperating under emergency conditions, were inmates randomly lined up and ordered into cells. At the present\\ntime the housing units are not racially segregated. Due to perceived emergency conditions the prison population\\nis temporarily confined to single cells under 24 hour lockdown. The defendants have instituted a security\\nclassification system under which inmates are assigned either a medium, maximum, or close custody grade and\\n\\nseparated into various housing units according to their respective classifications. The new grading system does\\nnot, however, provide for specific cell assignments and transfers on a non-racial basis. Accordingly, there is no\\npresent assurance that housing units will not become resegregated when normal operations are restored.\\nDisciplinary Rules, Punishment and Procedure\\n13. Prior to the July 27, 1973, riot, defendants administered a disciplinary program which could result in punitive\\nsanctions including punitive segregation as well as loss of incentive time and other privileges. These sanctions\\nwere imposed pursuant to a disciplinary process which is described in departmental policy statements and in the\\nmost recent inmate manual. Viewing the disciplinary process as a whole, to include both policies and practices,\\ndefendants have failed to afford inmates the procedural safeguards which are minimally necessary to insure\\nfundamental fairness. The record discloses the following:\\n(a) Inmates are not fairly adequately apprised of the conduct which can lead to disciplinary action.\\nSome, but not all, punishable conduct is contained in various rule books and manuals. There is,\\nhowever, no policy limiting punishment to listed infractions; some infractions are specified in\\nemployee manuals, but excluded from inmate rule books; some of the most common, minor\\ninfractions are nowhere listed or defined although punishment routinely results in the event of\\nviolations. In some instances, inmates have been punished for violating unwritten rules against\\nconstitutionally protected activity (e. g., assisting or being assisted by one another in legal matters\\nin the absence of reasonable alternatives).\\n(b) In the event that disciplinary charges are filed, the applicable Department of Corrections policy\\nstatement provides for pre-hearing detention in \\\"serious cases\\\" only. It was formerly the official\\n412 O.S.P. practice *412 to segregate only those charged with \\\"major\\\" offenses, as described in the\\nemployee manual. This practice was later changed by O.S.P. officials, and, thereafter, all inmates\\ncharged with any rule infraction(s) were automatically confined in segregation, prior to a hearing,\\nin the punishment work gang lockup area located in New Cellhouse or the new jail in the West\\nCellhouse. Because the Disciplinary Committee usually met only once a week, inmates could\\nroutinely be held in segregation for up to six days without a hearing, regardless of the seriousness\\nof the offense charged. Inmates have in fact been so held for up to six weeks before receiving\\ntheir hearings.\\n(c) The Department of Corrections has published rules governing the procedures to be followed at\\ndisciplinary hearings. They do not require, however, that the disciplinary committee be comprised\\nof disinterested persons. In practice, hearings have been and are held on occasion before\\ncommittees with a member or members who have either brought the charges against the inmate\\nor otherwise participated in the preparation or processing thereof.\\n(d) The official policy is to afford inmates a prehearing interview and an opportunity to appear and\\nbe heard at the hearing itself. Inmates are, however, denied the right to call witnesses on their\\nown behalf or to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. No representation is provided by\\nthe institution and outside assistance from counsel or any other source is prohibited.\\n(e) There are no departmental rules, criteria or standards governing the type or duration of\\npunishment which the disciplinary committee may impose for any given infraction. It has been the\\npolicy and practice at the penitentiary to impose indefinite sentences to the various lockup\\nfacilities. As a result of this practice, inmates have in fact often been held on punitive segregation\\nfor prolonged terms (which frequently reached six months to a year) under extremely harsh\\nrestraints and conditions.\\n(f) It is the written policy of the Department of Corrections to afford a weekly review of all persons\\non lockup by the Deputy Warden or his designee. The Standard to be applied and the procedures\\nto be followed during these review sessions are not, however, set forth. In practice, there is no\\nmeaningful independent review by the Deputy Warden or other high-ranking, responsible\\n\\nadministrative officer or panel. Instead, the responsibility for determining length of confinement\\nhas been abdicated to the correctional officers in charge of the individual lockups.\\n(g) The officer in charge of the Maximum Security Unit has been permitted to punish inmates\\nsummarily, without a hearing or any other procedural safeguards for conduct which takes place in\\nthe unit. Accordingly, inmates have had the minimal privileges afforded on M.S.U. further reduced\\nfor conduct deemed objectionable by the officers in charge. Similarly, inmates may be transferred\\nto one of several isolation cells on M.S. U. at the sole discretion of the officer in charge, without\\nany procedural safeguards other than the informal requirement that the Deputy Warden or chief of\\nSecurity be notified.\\n14. Inmates confined in disciplinary lockup, particularly in the Maximum Security Unit, have been held for\\nprolonged periods in close confinement. Exercise was limited to 15 minutes twice a week prior to the riot. Since\\nthat time all exercise was being denied as recently as the date of this trial. Sleeping accommodations consist of\\nmattresses placed directly on the floor or on a concrete slab. There were and are no beds. The cells are vermin\\ninfested. Lighting throughout the lockup areas was and is inadequate.\\n413 The isolation cells have the same dimensions and fixtures as other M.S.U. *413 cells. They are, however, sealed\\noff from the rest of the unit by a dividing wall. These isolation cells have only a small window or \\\"bean hole\\\" which\\ncan be closed to isolate the occupant completely and to seal out all light and ventilation. Such inmates receive no\\nexercise, reading material or any other form of recreation.\\nInmates who were sentenced to that form of disciplinary status officially referred to as \\\"72 hour detention,\\\" were\\ndeprived of food, clothing, bedding and necessary hygienic materials and confined in cells generally known and\\ncommonly referred to as \\\"hole\\\" cells. These are totally dark and stripped of all fixtures other than latrines and\\nfaucets. Penitentiary officials published rules for such \\\"72 hour detention,\\\" but there were no published\\ndepartmental policies governing the use of these \\\"hole\\\" cells. Confinement in these \\\"hole\\\" cells was discontinued\\nin the fall of 1972, pursuant to an unwritten administrative directive. The actual cells have been maintained and\\nremain available in substantially the same condition as before for future use at any time this or any subsequent\\nadministration so decides.\\nAdministrative Lockup\\n15. Prior to the riot, a large number of inmates were confined in administrative segregation on the top floor of the\\nwest cell house and on the top floor of the new cell house. Although some inmates were held in the administrative\\nsegregation areas for disciplinary punishment due to a lack of space in the maximum security unit, the majority\\nwere so held for a variety of reasons such as protection from other inmates, observation, investigation, awaiting\\ncourt action and pre-hearing detention. These inmates had been convicted of no infractions or offenses and had\\nbeen provided no hearings or other procedural safeguards. In spite of this, they were subjected to conditions of\\nconfinement which were punitive in nature. They were held in close confinement for prolonged periods with\\nminimal lighting and ventilation. They received no exercise. Their privileges were restricted and they were denied\\nthe oportunity to participate in the prison work programs, to earn work time or to engage in any self-improvement\\nprograms. They were not considered for trusty status or parole eligibility. Following the riot, administrative\\nsegregation as previously practiced was dispensed with. Instead, through the process of custody grading and the\\n24 hour lockdown, essentially the entire prison population is now confined in administrative segregation under\\nconditions which can still only be described as punitive. Inmates classified as \\\"maximum custody,\\\" are not\\nconfined in the maximum security unit, and the first floor of East Cellhouse although they have been provided no\\ndisciplinary hearings. Inmates classified as \\\"close custody\\\" are now confined on the second and third floors of\\nEast Cellhouse. Inmates classified \\\"medium custody\\\" are confined on the fourth floor of East Cellhouse and\\nthroughout the West Cellhouse. A limited number of medium security inmates who have work assignments are\\nalso housed on the first floor of New Cellhouse. Inmates with different custody grades received different\\ntreatment. Those maximum custody inmates assigned to the maximum security unit receive the fewest privileges.\\nAt the other extreme are the medium custody inmates who have been afforded work privileges.\\n\\nUse of Chemical Agents\\n16. The use of chemical mace and tear gas normally causes physical pain and discomfort and, on several\\noccasions appearing in this record, the use of such chemical agents has caused serious physical injury and even\\ndeath of inmates. Pursuant to his statutory authority, the Director of the Department of Corrections issued Policy\\nStatement No. 7302.1 dated January 4, 1973, regarding the use of force including chemical agents at all\\n414 Oklahoma Correctional Facilities. Under this policy, only such force was to be *414 employed as was reasonably\\nnecessary under all attendant circumstances. Definite guidelines for implementing the policy included the\\nfollowing:\\n(a) No person was to lay hands on a prisoner, except in self defense, to prevent an escape, to\\nprevent injury to persons or damage to property, or to quell a disturbance. In controlling or moving\\nan unruly prisoner, sufficient personnel were to be used to preclude the necessity for striking or\\ninflicting bodily injury. Gas was not to be used on an individual prisoner except to prevent serious\\ninjury or loss of life. Accordingly, physical force was not to be used to force compliance with rules\\nor regulations other than under the foregoing circumstances.\\n(b) When the use of force was necessary, it was to be exercised according to the priorities of force\\nand limited to the minimum degree necessary under the particular circumstances. When firepower\\nwas utilized, the aim would be to disable rather than to kill. The application of any or all of the\\npriorities of force listed below, or the application of a higher numbered priority without first\\nemploying a lowered numbered one, was dependent upon and required to be consistent with the\\nsituation encountered during any particular disorder. Priorities of force were:\\n1) Physical restraint;\\n2) Show of force;\\n3) Use of physical force other than weapons fire (Riot Squads);\\n4) Use of high pressure water;\\n5) Use of chemical agents;\\n6) Fire by selected marksmen;\\n7) Use of full fire power.\\nThe policy statement required that whenever a chemical agent was used on an inmate and/or\\ninmates, the Warden would immediately telephone the Director of the Department of Corrections\\nor, in his absence, the Deputy Director of Institutions. The telephonic report was to be followed by\\na written report containing all facts and circumstances concerning the incident.\\nNotwithstanding these directives, the wardens and other high-level officials at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\nMcAlester have approved or acquiesced in the use of chemical agents as a purely punitive measure against\\ninmates, including even inmates locked in their cells, in violation of the limitations imposed by the Department of\\nCorrections. Mace and tear gas have been used on inmates for such conduct as loud singing in cells, refusing to\\nget haircuts or to shave, possession of contraband (such as instant coffee) in cells, destruction of state property\\n(such as breaking plastic spoons), cursing an officer, talking in a loud voice or yelling, screaming for a doctor and\\nshaking or rattling cell doors. None of the incidents discussed above were shown to have presented any real or\\nimmediate threat to the security of the institution and certainly did not rise to the level of threatening serious injury\\nor loss of life. The Court finds as a fact that most, if not all, of these incidents were precisely the type of rules\\ninfractions concerning which the use of any type of physical force was intended to be prohibited by the\\ndepartmental policy statement. They were, rather, incidents that should have been dealt with officially, if at all, by\\nmeans of the use of the disciplinary system. Accordingly, it is clear that a pattern and practice exists of using\\nchemical agents against inmates when inadequate (if any) consideration was given by the officials involved to the\\n\\nthreshold question of whether a given situation warranted the use of any physical force at all, whether chemical\\nagents or otherwise.\\nChemical agents, such as mace and tear gas, have as an inherent characteristic the affecting of individuals other\\nthan those against whom they are specifically directed. This is a fact that has not been given adequate\\nconsideration by the defendants and their agents in determining whether such agents should be used in given\\n415 situations. The record reveals incidents in which these various *415 chemical agents were used against\\ndisorderly inmates under appropriate circumstances, but in excessive amounts. The Court finds that while the\\nuse of chemical agents was not wholly unjustified, the manner and extent of their use was improper.\\nThe record also reveals incidents in which chemical agents were used against specific individual inmates under\\ncircumstances justifying the use of physical force as a behavior control measure, but where other reasonable\\nmeans of controlling the behavior of the specific inmates existed and where the chemical agents could not be\\nused without visiting their effects on other, innocent inmates. The Court finds that the choice of chemical agents\\nas the behavior control device in such instances was not justified.\\nThe wardens and other high level officials at the penitentiary have routinely received reports of the improper use\\nof chemical agents by correctional officers, but have failed and refused to take any corrective action. The Director\\nof the Department of Corrections is either unaware of or condones the continued violations of the Department's\\npolicy, since the evidence of record reflects no action having been taken to seek to compel adherence to the\\nlimitations imposed by the Department's own regulations.\\nMedical Care\\n17. Defendants have maintained and operated a medical care delivery system at the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary which was and is incapable of providing, has failed to provide, and continues to fail to provide\\nadequate medical care for the inmates.\\nThe medical staff and facilities which are located at the main penitentiary at McAlester are relied upon to\\ndiagnose and treat the medical, dental and psychiatric problems of inmates throughout the penitentiary system.\\nPrior to the riot of July 27, 1973, the on-site medical staff, facilities, equipment and procedures at the Penitentiary\\nare systemically incapable of meeting the routine or emergency health care needs of the inmate population. This\\nfacility and the equipment and records it contained were destroyed during the riot. A temporary hospital ward has\\nbeen established in a former cellhouse and the security Captain's office is now used as an examination room.\\nPortions of the medical research facility adjacent to the penitentiary have also been converted to use as an\\nexamination area for trustees. It is obvious, however, that those inadequacies in plant and equipment which\\nexisted prior to the riot were aggravated by the riot and that no effective solution has been formulated.\\nProfessional dental care was supplied to the entire population by a series of part time dentists until July of 1973.\\nThough a full time dentist was hired at that time, no trained civilian support personnel have been hired to assist\\nhim. This level of dental staffing is unable to meet the routine dental care needs of the population intended to be\\nserved. Indeed, even if there were two dentists and they were provided minimal paradental support, they could\\nstill only be expected to treat 50 percent of the dental pathology involved.\\nThough approximately one half of the average in-patient population at the penitentiary is hospitalized for\\npsychiatric reasons, there is no professional psychiatric staff available for treatment on a regular basis. A visiting\\npsychiatrist makes weekly visits pursuant to an informal agreement, but he has not assumed responsibility for the\\ncare of these patients. The only \\\"treatment\\\" available at the penitentiary consists of temporary relief from\\n\\\"distress\\\" through sedation.\\nThe professional medical staff available to the inmate male population at the time of trial consisted of one fully\\nlicensed, part-time M.D., serving as chief medical officer, and two additional doctors who have institutional\\nlicenses which permit them to practice in state institutions, but only under the supervision of a fully licensed\\n416 physician. The *416 services of the institutional licensed physicians have been equally divided between health\\ncare of inmates and operation of the plasmaphersis program at the penitentiary so that the services of only one of\\n\\nthem are normally available at any given time. The actual services supplied by the chief medical officers have\\nvaried. The chief medical officer at the time of the riot was supplying full time services. Since his resignation, only\\npart-time services are provided by his successor, Dr. Karl Sauer, who also maintains an active, private\\northopedics practice in McAlester. Part of Dr. Sauer's time at the penitentiary is required to be spent on\\nadministrative matters.\\nFor many years, the penitentiary system has, for all practical purposes, been without any professionally trained\\nmedical support personnel whatsoever. Due to shortages in staff, defendants have continuously relied on\\nunlicensed, untrained and unqualified correctional officers and other penitentiary employees, as well as inmate\\npersonnel, to perform clinical and related medical services which should be performed solely by licensed and\\nqualified professionals. Such services performed by unqualified inmate and civilian personnel include, for\\nexample, screening medical complaints to determine which inmates on sick call will actually get to see a doctor,\\nas well as providing actual treatment and nursing care. Subsequent to the riot, defendants have placed even\\ngreater reliance on such unqualified personnel at the main facility where almost the entire inmate population was\\nbeing held on 24 hour lockdown as recently as the time of this trial. The lockdown has in fact seriously\\nexacerbated previously existing problems in the medical area.\\nDefendants have endeavored, both before and since the riot, to supply some medical services by referrals to\\nvarious outside facilities. This system of referrals, however, has failed to compensate for on-site deficiencies in\\nstaff and facilities and does not and cannot adequately meet the medical needs of the inmates.\\nThe past and present systemic medical deficiencies at O.S.P. have resulted in instances of actual impairment of\\ninmate health and continue to pose an actual and potential threat to the physical health and well-being of the\\nO.S.P. inmate population.\\nCorrespondence Rights\\n18. Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of arbitrary and unreasonable restriction, interruption and\\ndelay of mail to and from inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.\\nDefendants have unduly restricted the inmates' opportunity to conduct sealed or privileged correspondence with\\ncounsel, the courts and other governmental agencies. Incoming sealed correspondence has never been\\npermitted from any source and, until quite recently, all such incoming mail was opened and read. Outgoing\\nsealed correspondence with attorneys, other than the correspondent's single \\\"attorney of record,\\\" and to federal\\ncourts and government officials has also been denied privileged treatment, even after defendants purported to\\nrecognize limited \\\"privileged\\\" correspondence on or about February 2, 1973. Accordingly, at least some letters to\\nand from courts, attorneys and government agencies continued to be opened, read, copied, recorded, and/or\\nrejected. Furthermore, defendants' policy on privileged correspondence was never fully implemented. In apparent\\ncontravention of that policy, the established practice of officers in charge of the various lockup facilities at the\\npenitentiary was to deny any sealed correspondence privilege to their charges.\\nAn additional barrier to the confidentiality of such correspondence has been the failure to provide notary services\\nwithin the secured areas of the pentitentiary. Accordingly, legal documents which required notarization could not\\nbe sealed by the inmates, inasmuch as they were required to turn these matters in for notarizing, which was\\neffected outside their presence.\\n417 *417 At the supplemental pretrial conference held on December 6, 1973, counsel for the defendants tendered to\\nthe Court and opposing counsel a new Department of Corrections policy statement governing inmate\\ncorrespondence. Implementation of the policy statement was not undertaken until very recently and the record is\\nunclear as to the exact manner in which the new policy has been applied in practice. On its face the document\\npermits sealed out-going correspondence without restrictions. All incoming mail is still to be opened. Only\\ninspection for impermissible enclosures is expressly authorized, but reading is not actually prohibited. Any\\ninspection is required to be conducted in the presence of the inmate addressee, if the mail is from an attorney.\\nThis procedure is expressly extended to inmates on lockup or \\\"segregated\\\" status.\\n\\nUnder the new policy no privilege is recognized with respect to mail from courts and government officials. There\\nis no provision for solving the problem on confidentiality of outgoing mail requiring notarization. Moreover, any\\ninmate whom unidentified officials determine has violated \\\"certain imposed guidelines\\\" will apparently be reduced\\nto the limited opportunity to conduct sealed correspondence, as recognized under the old policy.\\nThe new mail policy also eliminates a number of restrictions formerly applied to unprivileged mail. Prior to and\\nduring most of the time this case has been pending, defendants severely restricted personal correspondence to\\nfive immediate family members, as approved by the penitentiary classification office. No other \\\"personal\\\"\\ncorrespondence was allowed. Mail of a non-personal nature was permitted, but only if the inmate's classification\\nofficer made a determination that the particular communication was of a \\\"business\\\" nature. No written rules or\\nguidelines defining \\\"business\\\" mail were ever established or made available either to the inmates or to the\\nemployees who were required to make such evaluations. In practice, classification officers exercised this\\nundefined authority in a manner that rejected letters to and from ministers, attorneys, government officials and\\nother similar correspondents.\\nUnder the new mail policy, inmates may not correspond with outside businesses or institutions for the purpose of\\nsoliciting catalogues, fee samples or educational material, or for the purpose of conducting their own business.\\nRegardless of purpose, they may not conduct any correspondence with persons known to them only through\\nnewspaper or magazine ads, or with persons in prison who are not immediate family members. There is a\\nseparate departmental policy statement governing the practice of religion which prohibits inmates from\\ncommunicating with ministers who are exconvicts.\\nIn addition to the foregoing expressed limitations, evidence in the record shows that certain inmates have not\\nbeen permitted to correspond with a San Francisco, California, prisoner aid group, believed by the inmates to be\\na possible source of legal services. There is no indication of change in defendants' continuous, but unwritten,\\npolicy of prohibiting correspondence of any kind in a foreign language.\\nAs indicated above the new policy authorizes inspection, but neither authorizes nor prohibits the reading of\\nincoming mail. On the other hand, there was never any express authority to read inmate mail under the prior\\npolicy. Nevertheless, the actual practice at the penitentiary routinely involved the reading of inmate mail for the\\npurpose of discovering and rejecting mail containing \\\"gossip\\\" and \\\"improper language.\\\" There was no expressed\\npolicy, purpose, direction or standards for such censorship, so the employees authorized to censor such mail did\\nso on an entirely subjective basis.\\nPublications\\n418 19. Defendants have in the past prohibited and continue to prohibit inmate *418 subscriptions to, receipt and/or\\npossession of certain magazines and newspapers.\\nIn the past, the official written rule was that subscriptions could be obtained to any periodicals on the approved\\nperiodical list. In fact, such a list did not exist. Decisions on individual requests to subscribe to various periodicals\\nwere made on a case-by-case basis, by penitentiary personnel, guided by essentially no promulgated standards\\nor procedures.\\nAfter the riot, a practice was instituted that prevented inmates from subscribing to any newspapers or periodicals.\\nQuite recently, there has actually been promulgated an approved periodicals list. As will be set forth in greater\\ndetail, this list still operates to exclude legal and religious periodicals. No procedure has been promulgated\\nwhereby inmates may seek to obtain approval for subscriptions to periodicals not on the approved list. In fact,\\nthey have been advised that all periodicals not on the list are contraband. The Court takes judicial notice that\\ninnumerable publications containing protected speech have not been included on the current approved list.\\n\\nAccess to the Courts\\n20. The defendants have failed to provide an adequate law library or any reasonably and adequate alternative\\nthereto. The library, such as it is, is located in a wood frame shelter attached to the wall of the main rotunda.\\nBecause of its size, approximately ten feet by six feet, only two or, at most, three inmates can use the facility at\\nany one time. The facility is so lacking in legal reference books and publications as to constitute no library at all.\\nFor example there are no reports of decisions by the United States Supreme Court or lower Federal Courts.\\nInmates are prohibited from assisting one another on legal matters and in preparing their legal papers since such\\nassistance may permissibly be provided only by a law librarian. In practice, penitentiary officials have also\\nfollowed a policy of preventing inmates from acquiring legal books. In addition, inmates have been and are now\\nprohibited from subscribing to any legal periodicals and have been denied the right to have in their possession\\nany personal legal materials or other assets belonging to them and acquired for the purpose of working on their\\nlegal problems, although the latter prohibition has recently been relaxed.\\nFor extended periods of time, the law library has been closed to inmates because no librarian was available. It is\\nnoted that during the year 1973, except for approximately six weeks, no law librarian was employed by the\\npenitentiary. During such periods an inmate could use the library only if a classification officer was available to\\naccompany him and to and open the library for him. Approximately 15 percent of the inmate population is illiterate\\nand the sixth or seventh grade average reading ability of the population is less than that which is required for\\neffective use of the more common legal reference materials. As is noted above, only the institutional \\\"law\\nlibrarian\\\" may permissibly assist these and other inmates on legal matters. The use of the term \\\"law librarian\\\" is\\nmisleading since no librarian employed by the penitentiary has had any legal training. When such a librarian has\\nbeen available he has been able to assist only three or five inmates per day. Inmates frequently must wait up to\\nfive weeks to receive assistance, if it is available at all. Inmates on lockup, regardless of the length of\\nconfinement, are prohibited from using the law library. They are only provided with legal forms which may be\\nused to file petitions with the courts. Male inmates from subsidiary facilities must request transfers to the main\\nfacility at McAlester in order to use the library facilities. Women inmates are afforded no library privileges and\\nmust depend upon visits from the law librarian, when one is employed and is available. Recently a new employee\\n419 was hired to perform the functions *419 of a law librarian. This employee is classified as a correctional officer I,\\nbut due to illness, has been unavailable for some time. It is heartening to note from the record that the\\ndefendants have made plans for upgrading the law library facilities, employing a full-time attorney and engaging\\nthe services of law students to provide legal assistance to inmates. However, such plans have not as yet been\\nimplemented and the conditions mentioned above still prevail.\\nReligious Freedom\\n21. Inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary who follow the Muslim faith do not, because of their religious\\nbeliefs, eat pork or any food mixed with pork or pork by-products. Said inmates have on numerous occasions\\npetitioned penitentiary officials to provide them with pork free meals. Penitentiary officials have refused and still\\nrefuse to provide the pork free meals so requested. Defendants have failed to provide special diets, even when\\nrequested by the medical staff for medical patients, and nutritional analyses of penitentiary menus show that\\nthere are vitamin and protein deficiencies in the diet generally provided inmates.\\nIt is common knowledge that many meals are prepared with pork or pork by-products. However, the Court cannot\\ndetermine with specificity, from the menus placed in the record, the extent to which pork or pork by-products are\\nused in the food now served to the inmates. Of course, pork served in its natural state is easily discernible, but\\nmeals seasoned with pork are often difficult of detection. The record is devoid of any evidence indicating that\\ninmates are advised of foods actually prepared with pork or pork by-products. It naturally follows that those\\ninmates whose religious beliefs prevent the eating of pork in any form, are often forced either to chance that the\\nfood they eat is free of pork or to refuse the food altogether. Because of the dietary deficiencies found to exist in\\nthe regular meals now being prepared and served to all inmates, the Court finds that inmates who follow the\\nMuslim teachings cannot obtain an adequate diet by foregoing the eating of food prepared with pork and will, if\\n\\nthey attempt to follow the tenets of their faith, receive a diet even more deficient than that received by other\\nprisoners.\\nMuslim inmates have also been deprived of the oppportunity to gather together for group religious services. It is\\nunclear for what periods this condition prevailed prior to the riot, since there is evidence in the record that some\\narrangement for such meetings had been made through the auspices of the Catholic Chaplain. Subsequent to\\nthe riot, there has been a total ban on group religious services regardless of denomination. This prohibition\\nappears to have had a greater impact on the Muslims, because such services provide their only opportunity for\\nreligious guidance. Protestants and Catholics at the penitentiary have at least the services of a civilian chaplain\\nwith whom individual consultations may be arranged however brief or unsatisfactory they may be.\\nReligious periodicals have not been included on the various official and unofficial approved periodical lists that\\nhave been in effect at the penitentiary at diverse times. Moreover, Muslim publications entitled \\\"Elijah Muhammad\\nSpeaks\\\" and \\\"The Message to the Black Man in America\\\" have been and are specifically prohibited by a\\ndepartmental policy statement dated April 25, 1968. No factual justification for the exclusion of these two specific\\npublications is shown. Likewise, no justification whatsoever is shown for the failure to include religious\\npublications generally on the various approved periodicals lists.\\nMembers of the Muslim sect at McAlester have earnestly urged this Court that their religious principles have been\\noffended by their integration with non-Muslim inmates. For the reasons set forth in the Court's discussion of racial\\nintegration this aspect of the Muslim complaint will not be honored and must be rejected.\\n420 *420 It is also claimed that none of the guards presently employed at the penitentiary are followers of Muslim\\nfaith. The Court has no reason to doubt this assertion, but finds no evidence that this condition has been the\\nresult of or has resulted in any direct or covert discrimination based upon religion or race.\\nFinally, the Muslim plaintiffs have complained that following the July 27 riot, they were locked up because of their\\nreligious beliefs. The Court notes that the entire population at McAlester was and continues to be locked up\\nunder punitive conditions which it finds deplorable. There is, however, no evidence that Muslims, because of their\\nbeliefs, have been subjected to conditions or restrictions more punitive than other inmates of the Penitentiary.\\nPrior Findings of this Court\\nThe trial in this case was heard on March 14, and 15, 1973, following a series of individual pro se cases\\npresented to the court during the week of March 11. At the close of this trial, the Court entered a series of\\npreliminary findings which dealt in general terms with the numerous unconstitutional conditions and practices\\nwhich have been described in greater detail herein. The Court further found from the totality of the record, that\\nplaintiff as well as the other inmates at McAlester are entitled to such injunctive and mandatory relief, as is\\nnecessary to correct the deprivations of rights which have occurred in the past and will continue unless enjoined\\nby order of this Court.\\nThe requests for additional relief were, however, denied because of evidence of contributing fault on the part of\\ninmates. Accordingly, it was and is the determination of this Court that the record does not support the award of\\nmoney damages to any prisoner nor is there evidence which would warrant the release of any prisoner from\\nconfinement prior to serving his full sentence.\\nConclusions of Law\\nJurisdiction\\n1. This Court has jurisdiction of this case. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1343(3) & (4).\\n2. The Attorney General of the United States was authorized to intervene in this action on behalf of the United\\nStates pursuant to Section 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000h-2.\\n\\n3. \\\"Federal courts sit not to supervise prisons but to enforce the constitutional rights of all `persons,' which\\ninclude prisoners. We are not unmindful that prison officials must be accorded latitude in the administration of\\nprison affairs, and that prisoners necessarily are subject to appropriate rules and regulations. But persons in\\nprison, like other individuals, have the right to petition that Government for redress of grievances.\\\" Cruz v.\\nBeto, 405 U.S. 319, 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 1081, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972). While federal courts are \\\"reluctant to\\nintervene in matters of prison administration,\\\" Hoggro v. Pontesso, 456 F.2d 917 (C.A. 10, 1972), the record in\\nthis case has led this Court to conclude that the defendants have been and are operating the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary in a manner which violates many rights secured to inmates by the Constitution and laws of the\\nUnited States. \\\"[A] policy of judicial restraint cannot encompass any failure to take cognizance of valid\\nconstitutional claims whether arising in a federal or state institution. When a prison regulation or practice offends\\na fundamental constitutional guarantee, federal courts will discharge their duty to protect constitutional rights. \\nJohnson v.

Sigler, 327 F.Supp. 829 (D.Neb.1971) aff'd, 456 F. 2d 1266 (C.A. 8, 1972) (per\\ncuriam).\\n5. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits racial discrimination in any aspect of\\nprison administration. Privileges must be afforded equally to prisoners of all races. Rivers v. Royster, 360 F.2d\\n592 (C.A. 4, 1966); Jackson v. Godwin, 400 F.2d 529 (C.A. 5, 1968); Owens v. Brierley, 452 F.2d 640 (C.A. 3,\\n1971). Specifically, prison officials may not discriminate on the basis of race when making job assignments or\\nadministering discipline. Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881, 901 (N.D.Miss., 1972) (appeal\\npending).\\n6. The present cessation of segregation in inmate housing coming subsequent to the filing of a lawsuit due to\\nemergency conditions beyond defendants' control is insufficient grounds upon which to conclude there is \\\"no\\nreasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.\\\" N.

Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed.\\n1303 (1953).\\nIn light of the prolonged practice of segregation prior to the riot in contravention of stated policy, and because of\\nthe uncertainty of post-riot conditions and the importance of the rights at stake, judicial relief continues to be both\\nappropriate and necessary. Rowe v. General Motors Corp., 457 F.2d 348 (C. A. 5, 1972); United States v. West\\nPeachtree Tenth Corp., 437 F.2d 221, 228 (C.A. 5, 1971).\\nProcedural Due Process\\n7. The due process clause proscribes any serious disciplinary sanctions against an inmate unless he is found to\\nhave violated written rules which are adequately promulgated prior to the commission of the infraction charged\\nand which describe punishable conduct with reasonable precision. Sinclair v. Henderson, 331 F.Supp. 1123\\n(E.D.La.1971); Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss. 1972) (appeal pending).\\n8. Summary punishment is unconstitutional; serious disciplinary sanctions may not be imposed on inmates\\nwithout a hearing. Inmates who are charged with infractions must be given official written notice of the specific\\ncharges against them. This notice must be given a reasonable time prior to conducting the hearing. Sinclair v.\\n\\nHenderson, supra; Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971); Nolan v. Scafati, 430 F.2d 548 (C.A. 1, 1970)\\n; Landman v. Royster, 333 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Va.1971); see also, Black v. Warden, 467 F.2d 202 (C.A. 10, 1972).\\n9. The determination to impose serious disciplinary sanctions on prisoners must be made by an impartial\\ndecision-maker Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971), cert. denied sub nom. Sostre v. Oswald, 404\\nU.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972).\\n10. The impartial disciplinary tribunal may not in effect abdicate sentencing responsibility by permitting line\\nofficers to determine the length of confinement. Accordingly, a denial of procedural due process results where\\nindefinite lockup sentences are imposed without a regular, meaningful and independent review reasonably\\ndesigned to enable the disciplinary tribunal or some other responsible disinterested administrative official or body\\n422 to make its own *422 determination regarding duration of confinement.\\nSee, Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973); Gray v. Creamer, 465 F.2d 179 (C.A. 3, 1972); United\\nStates ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, 467 F.2d 51 (C.A. 2, 1972).\\n11. The imposition of significant additional restrictions or sanctions on inmates who have already been placed on\\ndisciplinary lockup requires the same procedural safeguards as apply at the time of the original punishment. \\nAdams v. Carlson, supra; Palmigiano v. Baxter, 487 F.2d 1280, 1284-1285 (C.A. 1, 1973).\\n12. Automatic detention of inmates prior to disciplinary hearings can result in a denial of procedural due process.\\nWhether awaiting institutional or judicial proceedings or both, such inmates should be segregated only if a\\nreasonable basis exists therefore (e. g., their continued presence in general population status poses an actual\\nthreat to the security of the institution) and then only for a reasonable time until the disciplinary committee can\\nconvene to hear the case. The pre-riot practice at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary of having the disciplinary\\ncommittee meet weekly is not an adequate one for this purpose. Such hearings must be held as soon as is\\npracticable under the circumstances. Absent unusual and reasonably sufficient extenuating circumstances,\\nprehearing detention in excess of 48 hours (72 hours if a weekend intervenes) is presumptively unreasonable. \\nLandman v. Royster, 354 F.Supp. 1292, 1294 (E. D.Va.1973).\\n13. Even where the confinement of an inmate under punitive conditions is denominated and processed as an\\nadministrative, rather than a disciplinary matter, the indefinite confinement of inmates under such conditions,\\nwithout standards or criteria, and without minimal procedural safeguards, violates the due process clause of the\\nFourteenth Amendment. United States ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, D.C., 338 F.Supp. 311, affirmed, 467 F.2d 51\\n(C.A. 2, 1973); Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973); Gray v. Creamer, 465 F.2d 179 (C.A. 3, 1973); \\nHoward v. Smyth, 365 F.2d 428 (C.A. 4, 1966); Diamond v. Thompson, 364 F.Supp. 659 (M.D.Ala.1973); Allen v.\\nNelson, 354 F.Supp. 505 (N.D.Cal.1973); Bowers v. Smith, 353 F.Supp. 1339 (D.Vt.1972).\\nCruel and Unusual Punishment\\na. In General\\n14. The prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment is applicable to the State of\\nOklahoma through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660,\\n82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962).\\n15. It is established that the Eighth Amendment does not have fixed, settled and definite limits. The \\\"Amendment\\nmust draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\\\" \\nTrop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). This Court subscribes to the view\\nof the Eighth Circuit:\\n\\\"In summary, then so far as the Supreme Court decisions are concerned, we have a flat\\nrecognition that the limits of the Eighth Amendment's proscription are not easily or exactly defined,\\nand we also have clear indications that the applicable standards are flexible, that disproportion,\\nboth among punishments and between punishment and crime, is a factor to be considered, and\\n\\nthat broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency are useful\\nand usable.\\\"\\nJackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 579 (C.A. 8, 1968). In short, the parameters of the constitutional prohibition are\\nnot rigidly defined and are, in effect, discernible only in the context of specific factual situations.\\n423 16. \\\"Cruel and unusual punishment may be inflicted by the unconscionable *423 penalty imposed by statute or by\\nthe inhumane execution of a permissible penalty imposed under a constitutionally permissible statute.\\\" Bethea v.\\nCrouse, 417 F.2d 504, 507-508 (C.A. 10, 1969). While the great majority of cases involving the Eighth\\nAmendment have involved one or more specific acts directed at selected individuals (e. g., Trop v. Dulles, supra),\\nthe constitutional prohibition is equally applicable to general conditions of confinement. Holt v. Sarver, 309\\nF.Supp. 362, 372-373 (E.D. Ark.1970), aff'd 442 F.2d 304 (C.A. 8, 1971); Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621\\n(E.D.Va.1971); Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss.1972) (appeal pending).\\nb. Use of Chemical Agents\\n17. Chemical mace and tear gas inevitably inflict physical pain and discomfort upon, and can cause permanent\\nphysical injury and even death to the individual(s) against whom they are used. Accordingly, the use of such\\nchemical agents to punish inmates constitutes a form of corporal punishment.\\n18. At least in a State such as Oklahoma where State law clearly proscribes the use of corporal punishment, Title\\n57 O.S.A. \\u00a7 31, the use of corporal punishment on inmates is also cruel and unusual within the meaning of the\\nEighth Amendment.\\n19. Whether or not proscribed by State law, the use of chemical agents such as mace or tear gas as a punitive\\nmeasure rather than a control device results in the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the\\nEighth Amendment. Landman v. Royster, 333 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Va.1971). See also Morales v. Turman, 364\\nF.Supp. 166, 173 (E.D.Tex.1973) (involving Texas juvenile detention facilities).\\n20. That chemical agents have been used as a punitive measure may be inferred from evidence showing that\\nsuch agents are employed unnecessarily (i. e., without proper justification based on a reasonable concern for the\\nsecurity of the institution) or with justification, but in excessive amounts. See Landman v. Royster, supra.\\n21. The established pattern of unreasonable and excessive use of chemical agents at the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary has resulted in summary, as well as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and\\nFourteenth Amendments.\\nc. Conditions of Confinement\\n22. Solitary confinement per se does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661\\n(C.A. 5, 1971); Graham v. Willingham, 384 F.2d 367 (C.A. 10, 1967). Such confinement may constitute cruel and\\nunusual punishment, however, if it is maintained in a manner fairly characterized as foul, inhuman and violative of\\nbasic concepts of human decency, Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 526 (C.A. 2, 1967). In most of the cases in\\nwhich the conditions in solitary confinement have been condemned, the inmates were held in dark cells where\\npersonal hygiene was impossible due to the lack of materials necessary for personal sanitation and/or the\\ninability to properly dispose of body waste. See e. g., LaReau v. MacDougall, 473 F.2d 974 (C.A. 2, 1972) cert.\\ndenied, 414 U.S. 878, 94 S.Ct. 49, 38 L.Ed.2d 123 (1973); Wright v. McMann, supra; Hancock v. Avery, 301\\nF.Supp. 786 (M.D.Tenn. 1969); Jordan v. Fitzharris, 257 F. Supp. 674 (N.D.Cal.1966). Such conditions have\\nprevailed in the subterranean isolation area referred to as \\\"the hole.\\\" The conditions found to exist in the isolation\\ncells in the maximum security unit approach, but do not, standing alone, reach the level of cruel and unusual\\npunishment. Nevertheless, confinement in dark, unventilated and unsanitary isolation cells without any means of\\nmental or emotional diversion if imposed for prolonged periods will result in conditions which equal cruel and\\nunusual punishment. See, Morales v. Turman, 364 F.Supp. 166 (E.D.Tex.1973). Cf. Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661,\\n424 671 (C.A. 5, *424 1971) (partial dissenting opinion); Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971) cert. denied\\nsub nom. Sostre v. Oswald, 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972).\\n\\n23. Prisoners held in segregation for security or other non-disciplinary reasons must be provided as many of the\\nprivileges enjoyed by the general population as the nature of their confinement allows. Landman v. Royster, 354\\nF.Supp. 1292, 1294-1295 (E.D.Va. 1973); Allen v. Nelson, supra.\\n24. Where inmates are confined to their cells for periods up to one year and subjected to continual and enforced\\nidleness without affording them any opportunities for physical exercise, voluntary work, or educational programs,\\nit must be concluded that such conditions of confinement constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of\\nthe Eighth Amendment. Hamilton v. Love, 328 F.Supp. 1182 (E.D.Ark., 1971); Sinclair v. Henderson, 331 F. Supp.\\n1123 (E.D.La.1971); cf.Osborn v. Manson, 359 F.Supp. 1107 (D.Conn. 1973).\\nd. Denial of Medical Care\\n25. Inmates have a basic right to receive needed medical care while they are confined in prison. Edwards v.\\nDuncan, 355 F.2d 993 (C.A. 4, 1966); Coppinger v. Townsend, 398 F.2d 392 (C. A. 10, 1968); Schack v. Florida,\\n391 F. 2d 593 (C.A. 5, 1968), cert. denied, 392 U.S. 916, 88 S.Ct. 2080, 20 L.Ed.2d 1376 (1968); Martinez v.\\nMancusi, 443 F.2d 921 (C.A. 2, 1970); Sawyer v. Sigler, 320 F.Supp. 690 (D.Neb.1970), aff'd 445 F.2d 818 (C.A.\\n8, 1971).\\n26. As a necessary corollary of that right, prison officials have an affirmative duty to make available to inmates a\\nlevel of medical care which is reasonably designed to meet the routine and emergency health care needs of\\ninmates. Fitzke v. Shappell, 468 F.2d 1072 (C.A. 6, 1972); Campbell v. Beto, 460 F.2d 765 (C.A. 5, 1972); Gates\\nand United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss.1972) (appeal pending); Newman v. Alabama, 349\\nF.Supp 278 (M.D.Ala.1972) (appeal pending); cf.Jones v. Wittenberg, 330 F.Supp. 707 (N.D.Ohio, 1971) affirmed\\nsub nom. Jones v. Metzer, 456 F.2d 854 (C.A. 6, 1972); Chapman v. Gilligan, No. 8700 (S.D.Ohio, March 16,\\n1973). While a prisoner is not entitled to the medical care of his choice, Coppinger v. Townsend, supra, Judge\\nDaugherty has held that \\\"a failure to provide needed medical care by one having custody of a prisoner may under\\ncertain circumstances afford a prisoner a cause of action under Civil Rights Act.\\\" (Elsberry v. Haynes, 256\\nF.Supp. 738 (W.D.Okl.1966).\\n27. The actionable circumstances result where, as here, the level of medical care available to a confined and\\ndependent population is inadequate to meet predictable health care needs because of obvious and sustained\\ndeficiencies in professional staff, facilities and equipment. When continued and systemic deficiencies of this\\nnature exist and have resulted in the actual impairment of inmate health, and when such deficiencies continue to\\npose a current and potential threat to the physical health and wellbeing of an entire prison population, then\\ninmates are deprived of the basic elements of adequate medical treatment in violation of the Eighth Amendment,\\nCampbell v. Beto, supra, and are also subjected to disabilities beyond those contemplated by incarceration, in\\nviolation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Fritzke v. Shappell, supra.\\nCorrespondence and Publication\\n28. Inmates have a preferred constitutional right to correspond with attorneys, courts and government officials for\\nthe purpose of petitioning government and the courts for the redress of grievances. LeVier v. Woodson, 443 F.2d\\n360 (C.A. 10, 1971); Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971) cert. denied sub nom. Sostre v. Oswald,\\n425 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972); Palmigiano v. Travisono, *425 317 F.Supp. 776 (D.R.I.1970)\\n. The confidentiality of such correspondence may not be arbitrarily denied by prison officials, who are the likely\\nsubjects of an inmate's grievances. Defendants' practice of limiting confidential treatment to correspondence with\\none attorney, state courts and state government officials, but not with their federal counterparts, constitutes an\\narbitrary and unreasonable intrusion upon the inmates' right freely to petition their government and the courts.\\nSee, Palmigiano v. Travisono, supra.\\n29. This Court does not conclude that prison officials may not regulate or restrict forms of prisoner mail. Because\\nof its impact on the First Amendment rights of \\\"freeworld\\\" as well as inmate correspondents, however, the\\ncensorship of such mail must meet the constitutional standards which are generally applied to governmental\\n\\nregulation of protected speech. Accordingly, it must be shown that prison mail censorship furthers an important\\ngovernmental interest unrelated to the suppression of speech and that the mode of censorship results in\\nlimitations which are no greater than are necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental\\ninterest involved. Procunier v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___, 94 S. Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); United States v.\\nO'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968). Prison mail regulations which automatically limit\\ninmates to personal correspondence with a fixed number of immediate family members work an arbitrary and\\nunconstitutional prior restraint on the protected speech of both inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents.\\nSuch overly broad restrictions have been imposed on inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary solely to serve\\nthe administrative convenience of the defendants, without furthering any demonstrated interest in the orderly\\noperation of the institution or the rehabilitation of its inmates. Procunier v. Martinez, supra; Morales v. Schmidt,\\n489 F.2d 1335 (C. A. 7, January 17, 1973) (rehearing en banc, May 29, 1973, 494 F.2d 85); LeMon v. Zelker, 358\\nF.Supp. 554 (S.D.N.Y. 1972).\\n30. Defendants' policy of intercepting, censoring and rejecting incoming and outgoing inmate correspondence\\nbased on unwritten and/or ill-defined prohibitions against \\\"improper language\\\" or \\\"gossip\\\" including \\\"false\\nstatements to any correspondents\\\" is overbroad on its face and has in fact been applied in such a manner as to\\ninfringe upon the protected speech of inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents. Procunier v. Martinez, supra;\\nAdams v. Carlson, 352 F.Supp. 882 (E.D.Ill.1973) reversed in part on other grounds, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973);\\ncf.LeMon v. Zelker, supra; Palmigiano v. Travisono, supra.\\n31. Whether based upon the identity or characteristics of the correspondents (as in the case of approved list\\nrestrictions), or upon the content of their specific communications (such as \\\"gossip\\\" and \\\"improper language\\\"),\\nthe restriction and/or censorship of prison mail deprives both inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents of the\\n\\\"liberty\\\" of free speech. Accordingly, due process requires that the determination to censor must be based on\\nfacts rationally determined pursuant to such procedures as are necessary to insure fairness. Such minimum\\nprocedural safeguards include notice to the interested correspondent(s) and a reasonable opportunity to protest\\nthe decision of a prison official other than the person who originally disapproved the correspondence. Martinez v.\\nProcunier, D.C., 354 F.Supp. 1092, affirmed, Procunier v. Martinez, supra.\\n32. Restrictions on the free flow of information to prison inmates in the form of general circulation newspapers\\nand magazines results in a denial of the First Amendment rights of such inmates, unless the State can show that\\n426 such restrictions are reasonably necessary to the preservation of security, good order or discipline within the *426\\npenitentiary or the rehabilitation of the inmates. Fortune Society v. McGinnis, 319 F.Supp. 901 (S.D.N.Y.1970); \\nLaaman v. Hancock, 351 F.Supp. 1265 (D. N.H.1972). The past and present restrictive practices of the\\ndefendants, pertaining to the acquisition and retention of general circulation newspapers and magazines have\\ngone far beyond any possible legitimate needs based on the preservation of security, good order or discipline\\nwithin the penitentiary or the rehabilitation of the inmates. Such rules that have existed and such practices as\\nhave been in effect have been arbitrary and capricious on their face and as applied. The legitimate interest of\\ninmates in having access to the information, both social and educational, to be found in these various types of\\nperiodicals far outweighs any legitimate interest of penal administration or any proper regard to be afforded the\\nexpertise and discretionary authority of competent correctional officials. When prison officials conclude that\\neffective security, good order or rehabilitation require the censorship of such material, then with respect to each\\nobjectionable publication, the basis for the determination, including a written notice setting forth the relevant facts\\nwith respect to the particular publication, shall be provided to each inmate who seeks to obtain it. Such inmates\\nshall be provided a reasonable opportunity to submit additional facts and views to the decision maker before such\\ndetermination becomes final. Laaman, supra; Sostre v. Otis, 330 F.Supp. 941 (S.D.N.Y.1971); See Procunier v.\\nMartinez, supra. If it is possible to do so without defeating the purpose of the proposed exclusion, the inmate\\nshould be allowed to examine the allegedly offensive material and set forth reasons in writing as to why he feels it\\nshould not be excluded. In any event, the actual, final decision to exclude a specific issue of any general\\ncirculation publication shall be made by the Warden or Deputy Warden, who shall prepare and retain on file a\\ndetailed statement of the specific basis for each such exclusion for any jurisdictional court review.\\n\\nAccess To The Courts\\n33. Prisoners, no less than other persons, have a constitutional right of access to the courts. Johnson v. Avery,\\n393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L. Ed.2d 718 (1969). \\\"`Regulations and practices that unjustifiably obstruct the\\navailability of professional representation or other aspects of the right of access to the courts are invalid.' Ex parte\\nHull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L. Ed.2d 1034 (1941).\\\" Procunier v. Martinez, supra.\\n34. To be meaningful, the right of access to the courts must include the means to frame and present legal issues\\nand relevant facts effectively for judicial consideration.\\n35. Because the state has substantial control over the activities of convicted prisoners and because many\\nprisoners are indigent and poorly educated, prison officials have an affirmative constitutional duty to provide them\\nwith the necessary means for obtaining access to courts.\\nPrison law libraries are a basic means of assisting inmates to that end. Gilmore v. Lynch, 319 F.Supp. 105 (N.D.\\nCal.1970), affirmed, Younger v. Gilmore, 404 U.S. 15, 92 S.Ct. 250, 30 L.Ed.2d 142 (1971); Hooks v. Wainwright,\\n352 F. Supp. 163 (M.D.Fla.1972). The defendants have, at various times and in various ways, attempted to\\nprovide some form of legal assistance to inmates. The Court concludes however that the law library and legal\\nassistance program at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary have failed to provide these disadvantaged inmates with\\nconstitutionally adequate access to the courts. Johnson v. Avery supra; Gilmore v. Lynch, supra; Hooks v.\\nWainwright, supra.\\n\\\"The constitutional guarantee of due process of law has as a corollary the requirement that\\n427 prisoners be afforded access to the courts in order to *427 challenge unlawful convictions and to\\nseek redress for violations of their constitutional rights.\\\"\\nProcunier v. Martinez, supra. (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the requirement levied on\\nthe State of Oklahoma in this area of constitutional application extends to insuring adequate access to the courts\\nregarding at least habeas corpus actions, civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 and out-of-time appeals. Cf.\\nJustice After Trial: Prisoners' Need for Legal Services in the Criminal Correctional Process, 18 Kan.L.Rev. 493\\n(1970).\\n36. A state may not prohibit inmate self-help or mutual inmate assistance in legal matters unless it provides them\\nwith some reasonable, alternative means of protecting their right of access to the courts. Johnson v. Avery, supra.\\nDefendants in this case have unconstitutionally interfered with inmates' protected attempts to obtain timely,\\neffective access to the courts in numerous ways. This unconstitutional interference has extended to attempts by\\ninmates to seek and receive the assistance of attorneys, Procunier v. Martinez, supra; to acquire, retain and use\\npersonal legal materials such as law books, legal periodicals, and such other assets as are used in the course of\\nworking on one's personal legal problems, Cruz v. Hauck, 404 U.S. 59, 92 S.Ct. 313, 30 L.Ed.2d 217 (1971),\\nAdams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973), and to assist one another in the preparation of legal documents\\nin the absence of a constitutionally adequate alternative. Johnson v. Avery, supra; See also, Procunier v.\\nMartinez, supra.\\nReligious Freedom\\n37. Where the precepts of a religious sect call for its adherents to engage in a religious practice which does not\\npresent a threat to the security, discipline and good order of the institution, the state has the burden of justifying\\npolicies or practices which prevent such inmates from engaging in such religious practices. See, Cooper v. Pate,\\n378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1964); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263\\n(1972); Long v. Parker, 390 F.2d 816 (C.A. 3, 1968); Brown v. Peyton, 437 F.2d 1228 (C.A. 4, 1971).\\n38. The court finds no valid justification for defendants continuing policy of denying inmates including Muslims the\\nopportunity to gather together for corporate religious services. Walker v. Blackwell, 411 F.2d 23 (C.A. 5, 1969); \\n\\nLong v. Parker, 390 F.2d 816; Northern v. Nelson, 315 F.Supp. 687 (N.D.Cal.1970); affirmed, 448 F.2d 1266 (C.A.\\n9, 1971); Banks v. Havener, 234 F.Supp. 27 (E.D.Va.1964); Williford v. California, 352 F.2d 474 (C.A. 9, 1965).\\n39. In the instant case, the defendants have not offered any justification to support their food distribution practices\\nwhich prevent Muslim inmates from adhering to their religious practice of abstaining from the consumption of pork\\nand pork by-products. Such practices cannot be squared with the First Amendment rights of the inmates and, on\\nthe basis of the record in this case, are an unconstitutional application of state power. See, Barnett v. Rodgers,\\n133 U.S.App.D.C. 296, 410 F.2d 995 (1969).\\n40. In order to justify a proscription against religious publications, including Muslim literature, officials have the\\nburden of showing that such publications present a threat to security, discipline and good order within the\\ninstitution that cannot otherwise be overcome. Rowland v. Jones, 452 F.2d 1005 (C.A. 8, 1971); Brown v. Peyton,\\nsupra; Long v. Parker, supra. In the instant case no such showing has been made with respect to the prohibited\\npublications entitled \\\"Message to the Black Man\\\" and \\\"Muhammad Speaks.\\\"\\nRelief\\n41. It is within the authority and is indeed the responsibility of this court to order that all violations of federal\\n428 constitutional and civil rights, *428 and of rights and privileges secured by the laws, regulations and policies of\\nthe State of Oklahoma, cease forthwith. The Court is loath to consider the necessity of closing the Oklahoma\\nState Penitentiary at McAlester as a direct or indirect result of its orders. Inmates v. Eisanstadt, 360 F.Supp. 676,\\n691 (D. Mass.1973) affirmed, 494 F.2d 1196 (C. A. 1, 1974); Cf.Hamilton v. Love, 328 F.Supp. 1182, 1194\\n(E.D.Ark.1971). Notwithstanding the grossly offensive conditions and treatment of inmates found to exist at the\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester, it is also within the authority of this Court to refrain, in its discretion,\\nfrom entering at this time any order that would require or have the effect of requiring the closing of the\\npenitentiary. The Court concludes that, at this time, the interests of all parties to the case and the public interest\\nwould be best served by the Court affording the authorities of the State of Oklahoma and of the Oklahoma State\\nPenitentiary the opportunity to bring conditions and treatment of inmates at the penitentiary into conformity with\\nthe requirements of the United States Constitution, federal civil rights laws, and the laws, regulations and policies\\nof the State of Oklahoma.\\nJUDGMENT, DECREE, INJUNCTION AND ORDER FOR REMEDIAL\\nACTION\\nIn accordance with the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth above, and because of the determination\\nby the Court that it is necessary for an order to issue in this case and to be in effect during the time that may be\\nnecessary for the formulation, approval and implementation of plans for complete relief, it is\\nOrdered that the defendants, their officers, agents, servants, employees and all other persons in active concert or\\nparticipation with them, and all their successors in office, who receive actual or constructive notice of this Order\\nby personal service or otherwise as hereinafter provided, are hereby enjoined from operating the facilities of the\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary McAlester, Oklahoma, in any manner inconsistent with the following provision of this\\nOrder:\\nOrder on Racial Segregation and Discrimination\\n1. Racial discrimination in any aspect of the operations of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary shall cease forthwith\\nand forever.\\n2. All future cell or other housing assignments at the penitentiary, whether initial or subsequent, shall be made in\\naccordance with a classification and assignment system in which the race of the inmate is not a factor\\nconsidered. All requests by inmates for transfers from one cell or other housing assignment to another shall also\\nbe processed and decided without regard for the race of the inmate making the transfer request.\\n\\nIn order to insure that the mandates set forth in this paragraph are not allowed to operate so as to perpetuate\\nsegregation or facilitate resegregation, the warden shall set as a goal that all major housing units (cell blocks,\\ndormitories, runs, etc.) should generally approximate in their respective racial compositions the racial composition\\nof the inmate population as a whole. This is not to be an inflexible rule, as legitimate considerations within the\\noperating scope of a valid, non-racially biased classification and assignment system may well produce some\\nimbalances in this regard. The warden shall, however, on a quarterly basis, report to the Director of the\\n[*]\\nDepartment of Corrections, with copies to all counsel of record in this case,  a detailed justification for each\\nmajor housing unit that deviates more than 10% in either direction in the racial composition of its population from\\nthe racial composition of the inmate population as a whole.\\n429 *429 The warden of the penitentiary shall insure that there is no segregation within major housing units of the\\npenitentiary.\\n3. All inmates shall have an equal opportunity to be considered fairly for assignment to and advancement within\\nall jobs that are or may become available at the penitentiary. To assist in insuring that this is achieved, no\\npreference shall be given in future job assignments on the basis of any inmate's previous work experience at the\\npenitentiary, where such preference would have a racially discriminatory effect. Validly applicable work\\nexperience prior to entering the penitentiary and any relevant formal education or training may of course be\\nconsidered.\\n4. Records will hereafter be maintained at the penitentiary which will include the identity of the person(s) making\\neach initial or subsequent job or housing assignment and the basis for such assignment. If the previous practice\\nof assigning inmates only to departments or industries for work is reinstituted, with the specific job assignments\\nbeing made within the gaining department or industry, the records of the penitentiary shall include this same\\ninformation regarding each job assignment or reassignment within each department or industry. If there are job\\npromotions available to inmates, the records concerning each promotion actually effected shall include the\\nreason(s) why the promoted inmate was selected and the name(s) of the other inmate(s) considered for that\\npromotion.\\n5. Affirmative action to overcome the effects of past discrimination in the operation of housing, dining and\\nrecreational facilities, job assignments and the disciplinary system shall be formulated and implemented.\\nConceding that certain of these operations are either not carried on at the present time, or are carried on at a\\nlevel far below that which was in effect prior to July 27, 1973, it must nonetheless be recognized that the\\nrestoration of normal operations at the penitentiary could present the grave likelihood of the past pattern and\\npractice of pervasive racial discrimination being restored as well.\\nThe defendants shall, within 60 days from the date of this Order, formulate and submit to counsel for the plaintiffs\\nand the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the court for consideration and approval, their plan for the total\\neradication of any present segregation and other forms of racial discrimination, for overcoming the continuing\\npresent effects of segregation and other forms of racial discrimination as heretofore practiced at the Oklahoma\\nState Penitentiary, and for precluding the reinstitution of any discriminatory practices which were in effect prior to\\nJuly 27, 1973.\\nThe plan so submitted shall include, but not be limited to, provisions for the on-going examination of all operating\\nprocedures within the penitentiary for possible discriminatory effects; provisions for training present and future\\nstaff in the area of human relations, and the timetable for conducting such training; provisions for effective\\nstatistical and other checks and reviews at the administration level within the penitentiary; and provisions for\\nadditional checks and reviews within the Department of Corrections.\\nThe plan so submitted shall also include the details of a procedure for the review and analysis of records\\nmaintained pursuant to paragraph 4 of this order. To overcome the effects of past discrimination in job\\nassignments, the plan will also include a requirement, as to any specific job category wherein the racial\\ncomposition of the inmate group assigned to that job category deviates more than 10% in either direction from\\nthe racial composition of the inmate population as a whole, that a detailed justification for each such deviation be\\n\\nprepared on a quarterly basis. Such justifications shall be submitted over the signature of the warden of the\\npenitentiary to the director of the Department of Corrections and to all counsel of record in this case.\\n430 *430 To insure the eradication of discrimination in the operation of the penitentiary disciplinary system, the plan\\nshall also include provision for appropriate training for all individuals who prepare, investigate, review or process\\ninmate disciplinary reports, as well as all individuals who sit on or review the results of the proceedings of\\ndisciplinary committees, and all individuals who review, approve or consider appeals from the results of such\\ndisciplinary proceedings.\\nOrder of Procedural Due Process\\n6. The Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pertaining to this subject make it indisputably clear that the\\ndisciplinary system as it existed and exists at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary has failed to meet constitutional\\nrequirements in almost every possible regard. Nonetheless, the Court is not unmindful of the disparate views that\\nexist among judges, penologists and experts as to precisely what quantum of process is \\\"due\\\" in all of the\\ndifferent kinds of disciplinary proceedings that necessarily go on in a penitentiary. A similar disparity of views\\nexists with regard to many of the administrative decisions that must be made in the ordinary course of prison\\nadministration, but which can have serious effects on the inmates concerned. The Court is firmly of the opinion\\nthat the best disciplinary system is one that is universal, in the sense of being carefully constructed to deal\\nappropriately, but nonetheless fairly, with all of the varying kinds and degrees of offenses and rules infractions\\nthat can be and are committed in this or any other penitentiary. The same is true with regard to the administrative\\ndecision-making process by means of which significant administrative decisions affecting inmates are made.\\n7. Accordingly, the Court will make no effort at this time to prescribe a complete set of rules and regulations\\nregarding procedural due process, or even to provide detailed guidelines as to what would constitute an\\nappropriate and constitutional disciplinary system for the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, nor will it do so regarding\\nthose aspects of the penitentiary's administrative decision-making process that have led to constitutional\\nviolations in the past. If it is possible to do so, it is far preferable for those provisions necessary to overcome past\\nconstitutional deficiencies to be fashioned as part of an organic whole 00 that is, of a comprehensive system.\\n97\\n8. In the course of the preparation for and presentation of this case, counsel for the plaintiffs, the plaintiff-\\nintervenor and the defendants have gained a possibly unique perception of the problems herein involved. The\\nCourt therefore directs counsel for the parties to confer and attempt in good faith and in a spirit of cooperation to\\nfashion a detailed, comprehensive disciplinary system for the penitentiary system to which all parties can agree in\\na submission to the Court. The Court further directs counsel so to confer regarding the administrative mechanism\\n(s) by means of which decisions are made that significantly impinge upon the rights, interest, welfare and\\nrehabilitative potential of the inmates of the penitentiary. Even if total agreement concerning these matters is not\\npromptly achieved, the Court directs that counsel persist in their efforts and insure that as much as possible is\\nworked out through the process of negotiation and agreement. The final product of this undertaking will be\\nsubmitted to the Court for consideration and approval not more than 60 days from the date of this decree, and will\\nbe accompanied by (if necessary) submissions on behalf of each party regarding those points concerning which\\nagreement has not been possible and constitutional interests are involved.\\n9. The purpose of the Court in promulgating the foregoing portion of its decree is to attempt to insure that the\\ndisciplinary system and the administrative decision-making machinery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary are\\nconstitutional in all respects, but are at the same time adequate to fulfill the real needs of discipline and\\n431 administration *431 within the penitentiary. These goals are not mutually exclusive.\\n10. In the interim, the following rules shall apply:\\na. No inmate shall be disciplined in any manner except for violation of a written rule, promulgated\\nprior to the commission of the offense charged, which, in general terms at least, was adequate to\\nhave given the inmate reasonable notice that the conduct subsequently alleged as the basis for\\nthe charge could constitute a punishable act; this does not, of course, require that every possible\\n\\nset of facts that could be charged must be set forth with particularity, but it does prohibit punishing\\nan inmate for conduct that he did not reasonably know could be the basis for punishment;\\nb. No summary punishment shall be inflicted, although this does not preclude a correctional officer\\nfrom reprimanding or warning an inmate that repetition or continuation of particular conduct could\\nor will result in a disciplinary charge being filed;\\nc. Inmates charged with infractions must be given official written notice of the charges against\\nthem and, in reasonably specific terms, the conduct that formed the basis for the charge, said\\nnotice to be given a reasonable time prior to any hearing that must or may be held on such\\ncharges;\\nd. No written charge shall be disposed of nor significant disciplinary sanction imposed on any\\ninmate without a hearing at which the inmate is accorded a reasonable opportunity to be heard\\nand to present his defense to, explanation of, or matters in mitigation regarding the charge(s)\\nagainst him;\\ne. The members of the disciplinary hearing shall be impartial; as a minimum, no person who was\\ninvolved in bringing, investigating or processing any charge shall sit on the panel that determines\\nthe guilt of the inmate of that charge or the punishment, if any, to be imposed as a result.\\nf. Disciplinary charges against inmates shall be disposed of, by hearing or otherwise, as soon as\\npracticable and such disposition shall not be delayed pending possible action in the civil courts\\nconcerning the same or related matters.\\ng. If disciplinary sanctions are imposed that include indefinite terms in lockup, disciplinary\\nsegregation, etc., there shall be a review of the need for the continuation of such status on a\\nregular basis, either by the disciplinary panel that imposed the sanction, by an alternate or\\namended panel the members of which are impartial as defined above, or by a high-ranking,\\ndisinterested administrative official at the penitentiary; no correctional officer performing duty in\\nthe lockup area where the inmate is confined shall participate in the process of deciding whether\\ncontinued confinement is warranted, except that he may make such reports as to the inmate's\\nbehavior as are routinely required by penitentiary regulations and may make recommendations,\\nwith reasons therefor, as to whether continued confinement is so warranted;\\nh. Inmates on disciplinary lockup shall not be subjected to significant additional restrictions or\\nsanctions except in accordance with a procedure that comports with the requirements of\\nparagraph 10 a-f, supra.\\ni. Inmates who allegedly commit offenses or other rules infractions shall not be placed in pre-\\nhearing detention unless a reasonable basis exists therefor, such as the fact that their continued\\npresence in general population poses an actual threat to the security of the institution; absent\\nunusual and sufficient circumstances, pre-hearing detention in excess of 48 hours (72 hours if a\\nweekend is involved) shall be presumptive evidence of a violation of paragraph 10 f of this Order;\\nand\\nj. To insure that no inmate is punished in violation of the provisions of this paragraph through a\\n432 process of *432 denominating the procedure employed \\\"administrative,\\\" rather than \\\"disciplinary\\\"\\nin nature, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply generally to any administrative action to be\\ntaken that could result in the inmate being confined under punitive conditions; if an inmate is\\nplaced in administrative segregation pending investigation of serious charges against him, the\\nreview process required by paragraph 10 g shall insure that the investigation is being conducted\\nwith all practicable expedition, or the inmate shall be released from such status.\\n\\nOrder on Conditions of Confinement\\n11. Any future use of that form of disciplinary status which was known officially as \\\"72 hour detention\\\" and which\\ninvolved confinement in the subterranean isolation area commonly known as \\\"the hole\\\" is prohibited.\\n12. Effective immediately, before any inmate is confined in an isolation cell in the Maximum Security Unit,\\ncompliance with the procedures of paragraph 10, supra, is required.\\nWithin 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall submit to counsel for the plaintiff and the plaintiff-\\nintervenor for comment, and to the court for consideration and approval, a proposed set of comprehensive\\nregulations intended to govern future confinement in the isolation cells in the Maximum Security Unit. These\\nproposed regulations shall set forth the conditions and treatment to be provided inmates confined in such cells\\nand a maximum time limit for the duration of such confinement. Prior to submitting these proposed regulations to\\nthe Court, the defendants shall have said regulations reviewed by competent medical authorities, not employed\\nby or connected with the Department of Corrections, who shall also inspect the isolation cells themselves. No\\nproposed set of regulations shall be submitted to the Court that is not accompanied by a statement from said\\nmedical authorities to the effect that confinement in these cells, under the conditions included in the proposed\\nregulations and found to exist at the time the cells are inspected by said medical authorities, under the treatment\\nprocedures called for in the proposed regulations, and for the maximum duration provided for in the proposed\\nregulations, does not constitute an unreasonable risk to the physical or psychological well-being of an inmate so\\nconfined.\\n13. Inmates who are confined in any form of administrative segregation shall be accorded as many of the\\nprivileges enjoyed by general population inmates, to the extent enjoyed by those inmates, as the nature and\\npurpose of their confinement in administrative segregation will allow. This provision applies, notwithstanding the\\nfact of compliance, where appropriate, with the provisions of paragraph 10, supra.\\n14. All inmates shall be afforded a reasonable time outside their cells, daily, for the purpose of exercise or other\\nform of recreation. This provision shall be effective 10 days from the date of this decree. Weather permitting,\\ngeneral population inmates shall be allowed outdoors during at least part of this exercise period. If at all possible,\\ninmates in administrative segregation and disciplinary segregation shall also be allowed outdoors for this\\npurpose.\\n15. Within 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall cause to be made a study of the actual diet\\nbeing furnished to the inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. This study shall be conducted by an individual\\n(s) qualified in the areas of diet and nutrition. The results of this study shall be submitted in the form of a report to\\nthe Court, with copies to counsel for the plaintiff and the plaintiff-intervenor, and shall cover at least the caloric\\nand nutritional adequacy of said diet. The report shall also address itself to the specific question of whether\\nMuslim inmates are receiving the opportunity to be adequately fed (in terms of both calories and nutrition),\\nwithout having to eat items prepared with pork or pork by-products.\\n433 *433 16. Until other programs for the useful and constructive occupation of the general population are instituted\\nor resumed, defendants shall undertake to provide inmates with all practicable means for mental diversion and/or\\nself-improvement while confined to their cells.\\nThis portion of the Court's decree could be satisfied by offering inmates an opportunity to participate in \\\"cell\\nstudy\\\" programs, similar to those offered to invalid students in other state institutions.\\nOrder on Use of Chemical Agents\\n17. The unjustified use of chemical agents against inmates is prohibited. They shall not be used against\\nindividual inmates, or against small groups of them, except as authorized by the policy statement of the\\nOklahoma State Department of Corrections dated January 4, 1973. To support the use of this form of physical\\nforce, the requirement of that policy statement that there be an actual and imminent threat of death or bodily\\n\\nharm must be present. Chemical agents may also be used to quell an actual or incipient riot involving a large\\nnumber of unconfined inmates, where there is present an actual and imminent threat of death or bodily harm, or\\nan actual and imminent threat of serious damage to or the destruction of property which is substantial in quantity\\nand/or value. They may also be used to thwart the imminent escape of an inmate or inmates.\\n18. Whenever chemical agents are used against an inmate or inmates, all reasonable precautions shall be taken\\nto avoid or minimize inflicting the effects thereof on innocent inmates.\\n19. Chemical agents shall not be used to enforce silence or otherwise to enforce the rules and regulations of the\\npenitentiary, unless the conditions set forth in paragraph 17 are present. It will be an exceptional situation in\\nwhich the use of these agents can be justified against an inmate locked in his cell. Even where a large number of\\ninmates locked in their cells are involved in a disturbance, chemical agents shall not be used if they are merely\\nnoisy, or shaking the doors of their cells (so long as the doors remain secure), or because of anything they may\\nsay to or shout at any member of the penitentiary staff. These and similar rules infractions on the part of inmates\\nare properly dealt with by means of the penitentiary disciplinary system, with due process safeguards, rather than\\nsummarily.\\n20. As is the case with any use of physical force against inmates, the use of chemical agents must never exceed\\nthat reasonably required to effect the legitimate ends of penitentiary officials. Accordingly, the use of chemical\\nagents against inmates, on the rationale that the actual situation is one which could develop into 00 although it has\\n97\\nnot yet become 00 one in which the use of such agents is permitted, constitutes the excessive use of physical\\n97\\nforce and is prohibited both by the departmental policy statement of January 4, 1973, and by this Order.\\n21. Every incident involving the use of any chemical agent against any one or more inmates shall be reported in\\nwriting by the warden to the director, with copies to all counsel of record in this case, within three days of the\\nincident until further order of the Court. A full and complete statement of all relevant circumstances shall be\\nincluded in such reports. If, in the opinion of the warden, further investigation is required, he shall denominate the\\nreport an interim report and shall submit a final report when the entire investigation is completed, but not less\\nthan ten days after the incident. Any justified modification of the factual statement set forth in the interim report\\nshall be included in this final report.\\n22. Within the parameters delineated by this Order, there remains great scope for the proper exercise of\\njudgment and sound discretion on the part of penitentiary officials. The proper exercise of such judgment and\\n434 discretion should not be superseded by any Court and will not *434 be by this one. The contrary proposition is\\nequally necessary, however; the unconstitutional use of chemical agents against inmates can neither be\\npermitted nor condoned. What the Court has condemned in this Order is not the use of chemical agents in\\nsituations where the use of physical force against inmates is justified, but where reasonable men might differ on\\nthe kind or degree of necessary force. The Court has condemned the use of chemical agents in situations where\\nthe use of any physical force is unjustified.\\nOrder on Medical Care\\n23. Within 60 days from the date of this Order, the defendants shall formulate a comprehensive plan for providing\\nconstitutionally adequate routine and emergency medical care (including psychiatric care) to all inmates at the\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary. This plan shall be submitted to counsel for the plaintiffs and for the plaintiff-\\nintervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval.\\n24. This plan shall include, but need not be limited to, the provisions necessary for the operation of an in-patient\\nmedical facility within the secured area of the penitentiary (or in such close proximity thereto that security\\nconsiderations will not unreasonably delay the receipt of needed medical care by inmates in the security area).\\nThis in-patient facility shall comply in its operating procedures, staffing, equipment and physical plant with the\\nregulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Health governing the licensure of hospitals and related\\ninstitutions, or with some other set of comprehensive standards generally accepted within the medical profession.\\nThe staffing provisions of the plan shall provide as a minimum:\\n\\na. nursing care 24 hours a day, seven days a week;\\nb. a full-time Chief Medical Officer;\\nc. the equivalent of one additional full-time doctor;\\nd. an adequate support staff of qualified generalist or specialist medical para-professionals;\\ne. such additional dental and dental support staff as will bring dental care in the penitentiary\\nsystem to an acceptable level; and\\nf. a designated staff member to be responsible for insuring that adequate in-patient psychiatric\\ncare and treatment are provided.\\nThe plan shall also specify the extent to which medical facilities and personnel outside the penitentiary system\\nare being relied upon to provide medical care for inmates and the specific means by which such outside care will\\nbe secured. Also included will be appropriate provisions pertaining to the control, storage, handling and\\ndistribution of all medications.\\n25. Pending the formulation, approval and implementation of such plan, the defendants shall insure that each\\ninmate who goes on sick call is seen by a medical doctor or by a fully-qualified health para-professional (e. g.,\\nphysician's assistant, medical technician, etc.). No individual member of the staff or inmate population who is not\\na fully-qualified health professional or para-professional shall inhibit, prevent or obstruct any inmate from going\\non sick call.\\nOrder on Correspondence and Publications\\n26. The confidentiality of any inmate's outgoing correspondence to any attorney, court, or government official or\\nagency shall not be abridged. This provision is specifically applicable to mail to be sent to any court which is\\nrequired by that court to be notarized. Incoming correspondence from any of these sources may be opened and\\ninspected for contraband, but only in the presence of the inmate-addressee, and may not be delayed or read.\\n435 27. With respect to all other correspondence to and from inmates of the *435 penitentiary system, the Court has\\npreviously noted with approval the recent, significant improvement in defendants' policies. Within 60 days from\\nthe date of this decree, defendants shall submit whatever modifications of their existing policies, specific\\npractices or operating procedures in this area are deemed by them to be required or warranted in the light of the\\nprovisions of Conclusions of Law 29-31, inclusive, supra, or the recent decision of the United States Supreme\\nCourt in the case of Procunier v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974). Such shall be\\nsubmitted, together with a written presentation of their unmodified policies, practices and operating procedures in\\nthe form of a single, proposed comprehensive regulation for consideration and approval by the Court. Copies of\\nthis submission shall also be sent to counsel for the plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment. No inmate,\\nwhether enjoying unrestricted or restricted correspondence status under defendants' existing policy statement,\\nshall be subjected to any arbitrary limitations on the number of approved correspondents, the identity thereof, etc.\\n28. With respect to general circulation publications, such as newspapers and magazines, a comprehensive\\nregulation, consistent with all aspects of Conclusion of Law 32, supra, shall be submitted within 60 days from the\\ndate of this decree, to counsel for the plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for\\nconsideration and approval. This plan shall include all of the necessary and reasonable rules with which an\\ninmate must comply in order to subscribe to any such general circulation publication. It shall also include those\\ndetailed internal operating procedures necessary to insure that any present, continuing effects of past arbitrary\\nand capricious practices in this area are overcome.\\n29. No decision shall be made to exclude any publication except as may be required by the needs of security,\\ngood order, or rehabilitation; nor shall any such decision be made by any penitentiary official other than the\\nWarden or Deputy Warden, and then only after full compliance with the applicable provisions of Conclusion of\\nLaw 32, supra, regarding notice, opportunity to submit additional facts, etc. Any decision to exclude shall be\\n\\nmade solely on the basis of the content of the specific publication in question and the official actually making the\\ndecision shall prepare and retain on file a detailed statement of the specific basis for each such exclusion.\\nOrder on Access to the Courts\\n30. Within 60 days from the date of this Order, the defendants shall prepare and submit to counsel for the plaintiff\\nand plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval, a comprehensive plan for\\ninsuring that inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary have adequate and effective access to the Courts. The\\nplan shall consider and address the problem of reasonable access in terms of habeas corpus petitions, \\u00a7 1983\\nand other civil rights matters, out-of-time appeals, and such other matters as are addressed more particularly in\\nthe Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, supra. In order to insure that effective access is available\\nthroughout the penitentiary system, appropriate consideration shall be given to the number of inmates in the\\npenitentiary system, the fact of their geographic dispersion, the anticipated number of requests for post-\\nconviction legal assistance, and the educational level of the overall inmate population.\\n31. Pending the information, approval and implementation of such a plan, the defendants shall forthwith refrain\\nfrom interfering with the acquisition or possession by inmates of legal materials, including transcripts, lawbooks,\\nlegal periodicals, paper, etc. They shall also arrange for capable and experienced inmates to be allowed to help\\n436 those who require assistance in order to be able effectively to frame and present legal issues *436 and relevant\\nfacts for judicial consideration.\\n32. The defendants shall forthwith advise all inmates that they are permitted to subscribe to any legal periodical\\nand to seek to obtain lawbooks and legal assistance by mail. The defendants shall insure that the inmates\\nunderstand that they are permitted to purchase and possess legal periodicals and books specifically dealing with\\nthe legal problems of inmates and that they are authorized to write to organizations concentrating on such\\nproblems in an effort to obtain legal assistance, reference materials, etc.\\nOrder on Religious Freedom\\n33. Defendants shall forthwith cease all unreasonable interference with the provision to inmates of spiritual\\ncounselling and the opportunity to engage in group religious services.\\n34. Defendant shall forthwith advise all inmates of the penitentiary system that they may subscribe to and receive\\nreligious publications, including books, newspapers and magazines, unless any such publication demonstrably\\npresents a threat to security, discipline and good order within the institution that cannot otherwise be overcome.\\nMuslim inmates shall forthwith be advised specifically that the above authority to subscribe to and receive\\nreligious publications extends to the publications entitled \\\"Message to the Black Man\\\" and \\\"Muhammad Speaks.\\\"\\nThey shall also be advised of every food item served to the inmates of the penitentiary that is known or believed\\nby the defendants to contain pork or pork by-products.\\n35. Within 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall advise the Court, in writing, with copies to\\ncounsel for plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor, of the progress to date and of all future plans for providing religious\\ncounselling and group services, and of the fact of compliance with the remaining provisions of this portion of the\\nCourt's decree.\\nOrder on Security and Staffing\\n36. The Court has found that there were and are serious deficiencies in the level of overall security within the\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary. In different ways, this involves the security of the institution itself, the personal\\nsecurity of the members of the staff and the inmates who, as wards of the state, are entitled to and indeed must\\nlook to the state to reasonably insure their safety. The Court has further found that these security deficiencies are\\nin large measure due to both a serious shortage of staff at the penitentiary and to a very high turnover among\\nstaff members. Many of the unconstitutional conditions and practices that exist at the pentitentiary (or which\\n\\nexisted in the recent past and have present continuing effects) cannot be corrected without a considerable\\nimprovement in these areas of security and staffing.\\n37. Accordingly, counsel for the defendants shall, within 60 days of the date of this Order, submit to counsel for\\nthe plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval, a plan for\\neffecting promptly all necessary improvement in the areas of security and staffing.\\n38. In the interim, the defendants are advised that alleged shortages of staff shall not be deemed to constitute an\\nacceptable reason for the failure to comply fully with any provision of this decree. Unless specifically provided to\\nthe contrary herein, alleged security considerations shall also be deemed not to constitute an acceptable reason\\nfor the failure to comply fully with any provision of this decree.\\nOrder on General Provisions\\n39. Certain difficulties that arose in the course of the trial of this case would have been more readily resolved if\\npermanent records had previously been maintained of inmate housing assignments, by cell-block and cell,\\n437 beginning with each inmate's initial assignment *437 and showing the inclusive dates of it and all subsequent\\nassignments. Furthermore, compliance with certain provisions of this decree will be more readily determined if\\nsuch records are maintained. Accordingly, the defendants are directed to annotate the permanent records kept on\\neach inmate with his present housing assignment and to insure that subsequent assignments are also recorded\\ntherein.\\n40. Counsel for plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor will have access at all reasonable times to such records as are\\nmaintained concerning penitentiary inmates, whether or not required to be kept by this decree. They shall also\\nhave unimpeded access to individual inmates at all reasonable times for purposes of conducting interviews to\\nascertain whether there has been compliance with all provisions of this decree. Counsel for plaintiff-intervenor\\nare specifically authorized to utilize Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for these purposes.\\n41. If any of the defendants shall have any doubt or question as to the meaning, scope or application of any\\nprovision of this decree, the inquiry shall be submitted to the Court in writing in a communication from counsel for\\nthe defendant(s). The responsive communication from the Court will also be in writing. Copies of all such\\ncommunications shall be placed in the file of this case and concurrently served upon counsel for the plaintiffs and\\nplaintiff-intervenor. The same procedure shall apply to any such inquiries that may be deemed necessary by\\ncounsel for the plaintiffs or the plaintiff-intervenor.\\nThe defendants are charged with the duty of fully explaining the terms of this decree to all of their agents,\\nservants, representatives and employees, including penitentiary staff, guards and other personnel, and to assure\\ntheir understanding of the court's requirements and the necessity for strict compliance therewith.\\n42.

As litigants raising\\\\nthese constitutional issues, Plaintiffs were required by Illinois Supreme Court Rule 19 to serve notice\\\\nof their Complaint on Attorney General.   To Defendant\\u2019s knowledge, Plaintiffs have not done so to\\\\ndate.   A copy of Defendant\\u2019s February 13, 2007 letter notice to the Illinois Attorney General\\\\nproviding the requisite Rule 19 notice is attached as Exhibit A to this motion. \\\\nA. In support of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, Defendant states as follows:\\\\n1.  This action was commenced in the Circuit Court for the Tenth Judicial Circuit,\\\\nPutnam County, Illinois on December 20, 2006.   Plaintiffs\\u2019 Complaint asserts that the method\\\\nprescribed by state law for electing members of Defendant\\u2019s Board of Education has deprived them\\\\nof equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\\\\nConstitution. \\\\nThe Complaint also asserts that the Illinois School Code provisions in question violate Article III,\\\\nSection 3 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, which states that \\u201c[a]ll elections shall be free and equal.\\u201d\\\\n   2.   Defendant removed the action to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1441(b) and 1446\\\\non January 12, 2007.   Subject matter jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1331 in light of the\\\\nfederal questions presented, and under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1367(a) with respect to the related state claims. \\\\n3.   The Complaint alleges that pertinent parts of Article 9 of the Illinois School Code \\u2013 and\\\\nin particular, the section thereof which provides that all voters in certain multi-township school\\\\ndistricts shall elect all seven members of the board of education, but restricts the membership of the\\\\nboard to a maximum of three members residing in any single township \\u2013 violates the principle of\\\\n\\u201cone person, one vote\\u201d as applied to Plaintiffs and other residents of Township 32N, R1W, pleaded\\\\n\\u2013 2 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 3 of 13 \\\\nto be the majority population township in Defendant District 535.   See Complaint paragraphs 9\\\\nthrough 12.   (Although not specifically cited by Plaintiffs in their Complaint, this provision is found\\\\nin \\u00a7 9-12 of the School Code at 105 ILCS 5/9-12 and more specifically, in Ballot Format 4 set out\\\\ntherein and applicable to District 535.) 4.   The Complaint also alleges that this law unconstitutionally crimps the opportunity of\\\\nwould-be candidates residing in the majority population township to be elected to the school board. \\\\n5.   Plaintiffs\\u2019 Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to\\\\nstate any claim on which relief can be granted, in that controlling case law refutes both of the above\\\\npropositions. \\\\n6.   \\u201c[A]s a general rule, whenever a state or local government decides to elect persons by\\\\npopular election to perform governmental functions,  the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\\\\nAmendment requires that each qualified voter must be given an equal opportunity to participate in\\\\nthe election, and when members of an elected body are chosen from separate districts, each district\\\\nmust be established on a basis that will ensure, as far as practicable, that equal numbers of voters can\\\\nvote for proportionally equal numbers of officials.\\u201d  Hadley v. Junior Coll. Dist., 397 U.S. 50, 56,\\\\n90 S.Ct. 791, 795 (1970) (emphasis added) (holding that the \\u201cone man, one vote\\u201d principle applied\\\\nto the election of the defendant college district\\u2019s trustees). \\\\n    7.   However, as the Hadley Court went on to state, this holding did not inhibit states from\\\\nfinding ways to ensure that legitimate political goals of representation are achieved.  \\u201cWe have\\\\npreviously upheld against constitutional challenge an election scheme that required that candidates\\\\nbe residents of certain districts that did not contain equal numbers of people.   Dusch v. Davis, 387\\\\n\\u2013 3 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 4 of 13 \\\\nU.S. 112, 87 S.Ct. 1554 (1967).   Since all the officials in that case were elected at large, the right of\\\\neach voter was given equal treatment.\\u201d  Hadley, 397 U.S. at 58,  90 S.Ct. at 796. \\\\n8.   Dusch v. Davis disposes of Plaintiffs\\u2019 one person, one vote argument in this case.  In\\\\nDusch, the Court rejected an Equal Protection Clause challenge to a so-called \\u201cSeven-Four Plan\\u201d for\\\\nelecting members of the Virginia Beach City Council.   Under that plan, each of the 11 council\\\\nmembers was elected by a vote of all the electors in the City.   Four members were elected at large\\\\nwithout regard to residence.    Each of the remaining seven council members had to reside in the\\\\nborough from which he or she was elected. \\\\n9.    Delivering the opinion of the Dusch Court, Justice Douglas explained why this residence\\\\nrequirement was constitutionally unobjectionable: \\u201cIn upholding a residence requirement for the\\\\nelection of state senators from a multi-district county we said in Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433,\\\\n85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 201:  \\u2018 It is not accurate to treat a senator from a multi-district county\\\\nas the representative of only that district within the county wherein he resides.   The statute uses\\\\ndistricts in multi-district counties merely as the basis of residence for candidates, not for voting or\\\\nrepresentation.   Each district\\u2019s senator must be a resident of that district, but since his tenure depends\\\\nupon the county-wide electorate he must be vigilant to serve the interests of all the people in the\\\\ncounty, and not merely those of people in this home district; thus in fact he is the county\\u2019s and not\\\\nmerely the district\\u2019s senator.\\u2019\\u201d  Dusch v. Davis, 387 U.S. at 115, 87 S.Ct. at 1555-56. \\\\n10.   Likewise in this case, it is not accurate to treat a school board member elected by all the\\\\nvoters of a district of multiple congressional townships, as the representative of only that township\\\\nin which the board member resides.   Each school board member must be attentive to the needs and\\\\ninterests of the entire district electorate which votes the board member into (or out of) office. \\\\n\\u2013 4 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 5 of 13 \\\\n11.   Plaintiffs\\u2019 claim that the School Code provisions at issue violate their Fourteenth\\\\nAmendment rights as voters fails to state a claim, in light of the Supreme Court\\u2019s decision in Dusch\\\\nv. Davis, handed down nearly 40 years ago and cited and followed in many lower court cases.  See,\\\\ne.g., La Port County Republic Cent. Comm., 43 F.3d 1126, 1129 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding that\\\\nresidence districts need not have identical \\u201cor even similar\\u201d populations because voters may cast\\\\nballots for each of three county board positions, and affirming dismissal of suit on the pleadings);\\\\nHurlbut v. Scheetz, 804 F.2d 462 (8th Cir. 1986) (approving election system requiring at-large voting\\\\nin school board elections in sparsely populated North Dakota district, including restriction that\\\\nballots group candidates by residence and that one candidate be elected from each of five geographic\\\\nareas:  \\u201c[p]reserving distinct viewpoints of scattered geographical areas within a single governmental\\\\nentity has been recognized by the Supreme Court [in Dusch] as a sufficient justification for use of\\\\ngeographic residency requirements in conjunction with an at an-large voting scheme\\u201d);  Jt. Sch. Dist.\\\\nNo. 2 v. State Appeal Bd., 83 Wis.2d 711, 726, 266 N.W.2d 375, 381-82 (S.Ct. Wis. 1978) (electing\\\\none board member from each of nine former elementary school districts,  reorganized with a union\\\\nhigh school into a K-12 district, did not unconstitutionally \\u201cdilute\\u201d votes of residents in more\\\\npopulous districts: under Dusch, voting districts of unequal population are permissible if board is\\\\nelected at large and member of board represents the entire district);  Goldblatt v. City of Dallas, 414\\\\nF.2d 774, 775-76 (1969) (\\u201cappellant wisely does not contend that the Dallas \\u2018six-three\\u2019 city council\\\\nelection structure is unconstitutional per se\\u201d, the Supreme Court having specifically approved an\\\\nanalogous plan in Dusch: the one man-one vote principle is automatically complied with because\\\\nall votes are equal in a city-wide election). \\\\n\\u2013 5 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 6 of 13 \\\\n12.   Plaintiffs also assert that the residency restrictions in the challenged School Code\\\\nprovisions violate their Fourteenth Amendment rights as would-be candidates for the Board of\\\\nEducation.   They contend the law is fatally flawed in that, as pleaded in paragraph 10 of the\\\\nComplaint, it \\u201cprohibits plaintiffs and other similarly situated residents of Township 32N, R1W\\\\n...from being elected to said board despite having received more votes than residents of other\\\\ntownships in said District\\u201d. \\\\n13.    This assertion, too, fails to state a claim and should be dismissed pursuant to F.R.Civ.P.\\\\n12(b)(6).   Under the case law cited above, and to paraphrase Goldblatt v. City of Dallas, 414 F.2d\\\\nat 776, the possibility that a particular resident candidate wins in his township but loses district-wide\\\\ndoes not amount to discrimination against either the candidate or against the voters of that township:\\\\n\\u201cThe election is [district]-wide, and the elected official is a representative of the entire [district], not\\\\nmerely of a particular [township].\\u201d\\\\n14.   Even if the residency requirement were to be viewed as a species of ballot access\\\\nrestriction  \\u2013  which it is not, there being no limit to the number of Township 32N, R1W residents\\\\nwho may vie for such of the total three school board seats \\u201creserved\\u201d for them as may be open in any\\\\ngiven school board election \\u2013 the State\\u2019s interest in fostering geographic diversity on school boards\\\\nof large, multi-township districts is sufficient to justify the calibrated limitations reflected in the\\\\nprovisions of School Code \\u00a7 9-12.    \\\\n15.   Courts evaluate ballot access restrictions under a flexible standard that weighs the\\\\n\\u201c\\u2018character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth\\\\nAmendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate\\u2019 against \\u2018the precise interests put forward by the\\\\nState as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,\\u2019 taking into consideration \\u2018the extent to\\\\n\\u2013 6 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 7 of 13 \\\\nwhich those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff\\u2019s rights.\\u2019\\u201d  Lee v. Keith, 463 F.3d 763,\\\\n768  (7th Cir. 2006), quoting Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059 (1992), quoting\\\\nin turn Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 at 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564 (1983).    \\u201cUnder this standard,\\\\nthe rigorousness of...inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to\\\\nwhich a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\\u201d  Burdick, 504 U.S.\\\\nat 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059.   Restrictions that severely burden the exercise of constitutional rights must\\\\nbe narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance (such as education, see\\\\nFumarolo v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 142 Ill.2d 54, 566 N.E.2d 1283, 1299 (1990)), whereas\\\\n\\u201creasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\\u201d that impose less substantial burdens are generally\\\\njustified by the state\\u2019s \\u201cimportant regulatory interests\\u201d.   Id.    \\\\n16.   Unlike Illinois\\u2019 demanding ballot access rules struck down in Lee v. Keith, which in\\\\ncombination made it well-nigh impossible for independent candidates to run for election to the State\\\\nlegislature,  the electoral method objected to by Plaintiffs in this case does not severely burden, let\\\\nalone have the effect of \\u201cthoroughly excluding\\u201d (cf. Lee, 463 F.3d at 769) candidates from the\\\\nmajority population township entering a school board race.   Far from it:  three of the seven school\\\\nboard members may be elected from a candidate pool supplied by residents of Township 32N, R1W. \\\\n17.   Moreover, and as highlighted below, School Code \\u00a7 9-12 read as a whole is carefully\\\\ncalibrated to serve Illinois\\u2019 important \\u2013 if not compelling \\u2013  interest in bringing about, under\\\\npolitically palatable conditions, the consolidation of the State\\u2019s smaller school systems into unit\\\\nschool districts to more efficiently and cost-effectively secure public education of good quality for\\\\nstudents in grades K through 12.  \\\\n\\u2013 7 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 8 of 13 \\\\n   18.   District 535\\\\'s Board of Education is currently elected using the \\u201cFormat 4\\\" Official\\\\nBallot prescribed by School Code \\u00a7 9-12, which applies (insofar as pertinent for present purposes)\\\\nto community unit school districts formed prior to January 1, 1975 when the territory of the school\\\\ndistrict is greater than two congressional townships, or 72 square miles, except for those community\\\\nunit school districts formed prior to January 1, 1975 that only elect board members at large and\\\\nwithout restriction by area of residence within the district.   As District 535 does not fall within the\\\\nlatter excepted category,  its school board elections use the Format 4 ballot,  which provides that \\u201cnot\\\\nmore than 3 board members may be selected from any one congressional township\\u201d, and which\\\\napplies \\u201conly when less than 75% of the population.  is in one congressional township\\u201d.   105 ILCS\\\\n5/9-12 \\u201cFORMAT 4\\u201d.1\\\\n19.    If and when at least 75% but less than 90% of the population of such a district resides\\\\nin one congressional township, then the number of school board members to be selected from that\\\\none township increases to four, and the remaining three board members are selected from the district\\\\n1  Plaintiffs plead the facts which illustrate the applicability of Format 4 only obliquely, in Complaint paragraph\\\\n10 which asserts, \\u201cUnder the provisions of 105 ILCS 5/11A-8, succeeded by 105 ILCS 5/9, only three of the\\\\nseven members of the Board of Education of Putnam Community Unit School District # 535 may reside in\\\\nTownship 32 N R1W of the 3rd Principal Meridian, notwithstanding the fact that a majority of the residents of\\\\nsaid District reside in said township.\\u201d  (Emphasis added).  \\\\nReferenced \\u00a7 11A-8 of the School Code (105 ILCS 5/11A-8) described the requirements for passage of\\\\nreferenda  to  create  a  community  unit  school  district  and,  in  the  cases  of  community  unit  districts\\\\nencompassing more than two congressional townships or 72 square miles, prescribed the geographic\\\\nrepresentation requirements calibrated to population which are contained in the Official Ballot Formats set out\\\\nin School Code \\u00a7 9-12, reviewed above.   See former \\u00a7 11A-8(b), 105 ILCS 5/11A-8(b). \\\\nSection 11A-8 was repealed along with the rest of School Code Article 11A (\\u201cUnit District Formation\\u201d by Public\\\\nAct 94-1019, effective July 10, 2006.   In P.A. 94-1019, the legislature comprehensively updated school\\\\nreorganization mechanisms to further encourage and remove perceived barriers to school consolidations. \\\\nAs P.A. 94-1019 did not repeal School Code \\u00a7 9-12, the ballot  formats prescribed in that section remain in\\\\nuse, as applicable in particular unit districts.  \\\\n\\u2013 8 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 9 of 13 \\\\nin elections which are then conducted using Official Ballot Format 5.   See 105 ILCS 5/9-12\\\\n\\u201cFORMAT 5\\\".  \\\\n20.   If and when more than 90% of the population of such a district resides in one\\\\ncongressional township, Official Ballot Format 2 is used.   Then school board members are elected\\\\nat large, and  \\u201c[m]embership on the school board is not restricted by area of residence.\\u201d  See 105\\\\nILCS 5/9-12 \\u201cFORMAT 2\\\"; cf. Complaint Count Two, paragraph 14.B., in which Plaintiffs ask the\\\\nthis Court to direct that Format 2 be used in \\u201cany election for members of the board of education\\\\nof...District # 535\\\", and that \\u201ccandidates receiving the highest number of votes be elected to said\\\\nboard, irrespective of their place of residence in said district.\\u201d \\\\n21.   Plaintiffs are not entitled to such extraordinary equitable relief, nor to any relief at all.\\\\n The automatic adjustments of school board electoral mechanisms built into School Code \\u00a7 9-12\\\\nrepresent exactly the type of narrow tailoring  courts look for, in evaluating whether a ballot access\\\\nrestriction exceeds what is needed to serve a compelling state interest in situations where election\\\\nlaw restrictions impose a \\u201csevere\\u201d burden on rights of potential candidates.  \\\\n22.   But again, School Code \\u00a7 9-12\\\\'s election provisions do not place a \\u201csevere\\u201d burden on\\\\nprospective school board candidates from majority population townships, and find explicit sanction\\\\nin the U.S. Supreme Court\\u2019s decisions in Dusch and Hadley.    Any judicial evaluation of the election\\\\nprovisions  in  \\u00a7  9-12  must  proceed  under  the  standard  which  applies  to  \\u201creasonable\\\\nnondiscriminatory restrictions\\u201d which impose modest \\u201cburdens\\u201d to serve important State regulatory\\\\ninterests, see Lee v. Keith, above.   The provisions of the School Code challenged by Plaintiffs readily\\\\nsatisfy that standard. \\\\n\\u2013 9 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 10 of 13 \\\\n23.   Last but not least,  the de minimus and constitutionally permissible \\u201cburdens\\u201d assertedly\\\\nimposed by School Code \\u00a7 9-12\\\\'s applicable provisions are further alleviated by the fact that School\\\\nCode \\u00a7 9-22 provides a method by which Plaintiffs and their fellow electors / would-be candidates\\\\nresident in Township 32N, R1W can initiate a referendum on the proposition of electing school\\\\nboard members by school board districts if they deem that system preferable, instead of district-wide\\\\nas is presently done.  \\\\n24.   Section 9-22 authorizes such a referendum if initiated by the board of education, or on\\\\npetition of the lesser of 2,500 or 5% of registered voters of the district.   The proposition passes if a\\\\nsimple majority of voters, district-wide, approves it.   Thus, if District 535 voters in Township 32N\\\\nR1W want to eliminate the alleged unequal burdening of their rights as candidates by adopting an\\\\nelection-by-district system, then as the most populous group of electors in the district they have\\\\nample political power to attain this fully adequate remedy at law.\\\\n25.   Dismissal of Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims insofar as they are founded on the \\u201cfree and fair elections\\u201d\\\\nprovisions of the Article III, Section 3 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution is also warranted.   The\\\\nIllinois Supreme Court has equated the Illinois Constitution\\u2019s guarantee of \\u201cequal protection of the\\\\nlaws\\u201d, and the \\u201cfree and equal\\u201d requirements of Article III, Section 3, with protections afforded by\\\\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stating that no precedent suggests that\\\\nthe Illinois Constitution calls for more than the Federal Constitution in relation to equal protection\\\\nsafeguards.   Fumarolo v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 142 Ill.2d 54, 566 N.E.2d 1283, 1290 (1990).   \\\\n21.    In accordance with Local Rule 7.1(A)(2), Defendant respectfully requests an opportunity\\\\nto present oral argument on this Rule 12(b)(6) motion, to provide the Court an opportunity to\\\\n\\u2013 10 \\u2013\\\\n\\\\n1:07-cv-01011-JBM-JAG   # 5    Filed: 02/14/07    Page 11 of 13 \\\\nquestion and receive clarification from the parties directly concerning any points deemed relevant\\\\nto disposition of the motion. \\\\nB. In support of its motion to stay briefing and other proceedings in this cause for\\\\na  reasonable  period  of  time  to  afford  the  Illinois  Attorney  General  an\\\\nopportunity  to  seek  intervention  for  the  purpose  of  defending  the\\\\nconstitutionality of the statutes involved, Defendant states that: \\\\n1.   Although eight weeks have passed since they commenced this action in state court,\\\\nPlaintiffs have not, to Defendant\\u2019s knowledge, served notice on the Illinois Attorney General of their\\\\ncause of action asserting that School Code Article 9\\\\'s pertinent provisions are unconstitutional, as\\\\nthey are required to do by Illinois Supreme Court Rule 19 in order to afford the State an opportunity\\\\nto seek intervention for the purpose of defending the constitutionality of the challenged law.\\\\n2.   Because Plaintiffs\\u2019 action contests the validity of Defendant\\u2019s Board of Education as\\\\nelected pursuant to the challenged statutes, and the right of current Board members to hold their\\\\noffices, it critically affects not only Putnam County Community Unit School District No. 235 but\\\\nother Illinois school districts in which elections are subject to the mandatory board representation\\\\nprovisions of School Code \\u00a7 9-12.    \\\\n3.   In light of the requirements of Illinois Supreme Court Rule 19 and the clearly apparent\\\\ninterest and obligation of the State to defend the constitutionality of School Code Section 9-12\\\\nchallenged in this action, Defendant has provided letter notice of this action to the Illinois Attorney\\\\nGeneral.   A copy of said notice as hand-delivered to Attorney General\\u2019s Chicago office on February\\\\n13, 2007 is attached to this motion.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (\\u201cBOP\\u201d) has established two separate systems to \\\\ncalculate its residents\\u2019 \\u201ccriminal history scores,\\u201d a number that is used to determine Plaintiffs\\u2019 \\\\nsecurity classification, i.e. the security level of the prisons in which Plaintiffs are placed, and their \\\\neligibility for home confinement and release to a halfway house.  \\\\n2.   These  two,  separate  criminal  history  scoring  systems  apply  arbitrarily  and \\\\nunequally to BOP residents based on the court from which they were sentenced \\u2014 federal district \\\\ncourts or another court system, such as the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, other state \\\\ncourts, or military tribunals.   This action specifically challenges the application of a different \\\\ncriminal history scoring rule to the group of individuals that are sentenced by the Superior Court \\\\nfor the District of Columbia and transferred to BOP custody to serve their sentences, i.e. Plaintiffs \\\\nand proposed class.  \\\\n3.   The first system \\u2014 which is based on Chapter 4 of the United States Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines\\u2019 calculation of criminal history points \\u2014 applies to the vast majority of BOP residents \\\\nwho were sentenced by a federal district court and who enter the BOP with a commitment order, \\\\na statement of reasons, and/or a presentence report that lists their Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\\\nhistory points.   For these residents, the BOP simply relies upon their Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 \\\\ncriminal history points to determine their criminal history score.  \\\\n4.   The second system applies to the small minority of BOP residents who do not enter \\\\nthe BOP with a Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal history points calculation, including individuals \\\\nwho were sentenced by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, other state courts, or \\\\nmilitary tribunals.   See U.S. DEP\\u2019T OF JUSTICE, FED. BUREAU OF PRISONS, PROGRAM STATEMENT \\\\n  2 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 3 of 33\\\\n5100.08: INMATE SECURITY DESIGNATION & CUSTODY CLASSIFICATION (\\u201cPS 5100.08\\u201d) 33 (2006).   \\\\nFor  those  residents,  including  Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members,  the  BOP\\u2019s  Program \\\\nStatement 5100.08 applies a separate scoring system to tabulate their criminal history points and \\\\nthen converts those points into a criminal history score.  \\\\n5.   In the overwhelming number of cases, people subject to the second system receive \\\\nhigher criminal history scores than people subject to the first system.   In other words, the BOP\\u2019s \\\\nProgram Statement 5100.08 yields more criminal history points \\u2014 and a higher criminal history \\\\nscore \\u2014 than the criminal history points calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines for similarly \\\\nsituated incarcerated people.  \\\\n6.   Because the criminal history score is the most significant factor in determining \\\\nsomeone\\u2019s security classification, individuals with higher criminal history scores are more likely \\\\nto be incarcerated in a high security facility.   As a result of BOP\\u2019s arbitrary and unequal criminal \\\\nhistory scoring system, Plaintiffs and proposed class members are more likely to be incarcerated \\\\nin high security BOP facilities, where they are subjected to greater violence and offered fewer \\\\nprogramming opportunities, and they are denied opportunities to seek release to home confinement \\\\nthat might otherwise be available to them.  \\\\n7.   Empirical evidence bears this unequal treatment out.   Twelve percent of BOP \\\\nresidents overall are incarcerated in high security institutions, whereas 39 percent of \\u201cD.C.  Code \\\\noffenders\\u201d are housed in those institutions.   See COUNCIL FOR COURT EXCELLENCE, ANALYSIS OF \\\\nBOP DATA SNAPSHOT FROM JULY 4, 2020 FOR THE DISTRICT TASK FORCE ON JAILS AND JUSTICE 4 \\\\n(2020),  http://www.courtexcellence.org/uploads/publications/Analysis_of_BOP_Data_Snapshot \\\\n_from_7420.pdf.   Plaintiffs and proposed class members  are three times more likely to be \\\\n  3 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 4 of 33\\\\nincarcerated in a high security penitentiary than other BOP residents and could be systematically \\\\nexcluded from seeking release to home confinement.  \\\\n8.   The  BOP\\u2019s  separate  scoring  system  also  disproportionately  affects  its  Black \\\\nresidents as 95.6 percent of people who are sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court and who are in \\\\nBOP custody are Black.  See COUNCIL FOR COURT EXCELLENCE, ANALYSIS OF BOP DATA \\\\nSNAPSHOT FROM JULY 4, 2020 FOR THE DISTRICT TASK FORCE ON JAILS AND JUSTICE 2 (2020), \\\\nhttp://www.courtexcellence.org/uploads/publications/Analysis_of_BOP_Data_Snapshot_from_7\\\\n420.pdf.   By contrast, the majority of individuals sentenced by federal district courts are white.   \\\\nThe BOP tracks the racial composition of individuals in its custody and at individual facilities and \\\\nis aware of the racial differences between the two populations.   Applying a harsher criminal history \\\\nscoring system to the majority-Black population of individuals sentenced by the Superior Court \\\\nfor the District of Columbia puts them at a significant disadvantage to their majority-white federal \\\\ncounterparts.   This is doubly concerning because the BOP\\u2019s own regulations make clear that \\u201cstaff \\\\nshall not discriminate against inmates on the basis of race * * * [in] providing access to work, \\\\nhousing and programs.\\u201d  28 C.F.R. \\u00a7 551.90.  \\\\n9.   The BOP\\u2019s two-tiered system for calculating criminal history scores is arbitrary, \\\\ncapricious, and contrary to law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 501 \\\\net seq., and unconstitutional in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment, \\\\nU.S. Cons. amend.  V.  \\\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \\\\n10.   This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\\\nSection 1331 because it arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States.  \\\\n  4 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 5 of 33\\\\n11.   Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \\\\n\\u00a7 2201 and 2202, by 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 702, by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and 65, and by the \\\\ninherent equitable powers of this Court. \\\\n12.   Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1391(e)(1) because a substantial \\\\npart of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred, and continue to occur, in this \\\\nDistrict.  \\\\nPARTIES \\\\n13.   Plaintiff Jonathan Blades was convicted of D.C. Code offenses and is serving his \\\\nsentence in the Bureau of Prisons.   Mr. Blades is Black and currently incarcerated at United States \\\\nPenitentiary (USP) Pollock, a high security penitentiary located in Pollock, Louisiana.    \\\\n14.   Mr.  Blades\\u2019  criminal  history  points  were  assessed  under  Program  Statement \\\\n5100.08, and not the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, because Mr. Blades was sentenced in the \\\\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia and is serving his sentence in BOP custody.   \\\\n15.   If Mr. Blades\\u2019 criminal history points were scored under the Sentencing Guidelines, \\\\nhis criminal history points would be lower than they currently are because the Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines would not award points for his juvenile probationary sentences or for his 2002 adult \\\\nprobationary sentences that occurred more than 10 years prior to the instant offense.  \\\\n16.   Plaintiff Antwan Buchanan was convicted of D.C. Code offenses and is serving his \\\\nsentence in the Bureau of Prisons.   Mr. Buchanan is Black and is currently incarcerated at USP \\\\nBig Sandy, a high security penitentiary located in Inez, Kentucky.  \\\\n17.   Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s criminal history points were assessed under Program Statement \\\\n5100.08, and not the Sentencing Guidelines, because Mr. Buchanan was sentenced in the Superior \\\\nCourt of the District of Columbia and is serving his sentence in BOP custody.   \\\\n  5 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 6 of 33\\\\n18.   If  Mr.  Buchanan\\u2019s  criminal  history  points  were  scored  under  the  Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines, his criminal history points would be lower than they currently are because the \\\\nSentencing Guidelines would not count a 2002 conviction and a 2004 conviction and he would \\\\nreceive fewer criminal history points for his 2006 and 2008 convictions.  \\\\n19.   Defendant Michael Carvajal is sued in his official capacity as Director, Federal Bureau \\\\nof Prisons.   In this capacity, Defendant Carvajal oversees the operations of the Federal Bureau of \\\\nPrisons.  \\\\nBACKGROUND \\\\n20.   Congress requires the Bureau of Prisons to consider \\u201cthe history and characteristics \\\\nof the prisoner\\u201d as well as a \\u201cprisoner\\u2019s security designation\\u201d when designating prisoners to \\\\ncorrectional facilities.   18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 3621(b).  \\\\n21.   Pursuant to that statutory requirement, the BOP issued Program Statement 5100.08 \\\\nin 2006, outlining how the BOP would weigh those factors when designating individuals to prisons \\\\nacross the country.    \\\\n22.   BOP institutions fall into \\u201cfive security levels\\u201d: \\u201cMINIMUM, LOW, MEDIUM, \\\\nHIGH, and ADMINISTRATIVE.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 7.  \\\\n23.   To designate prisoners into one of those five security levels of institutions, the BOP \\\\nrelies on a set of inputs to \\u201ccalculate[] a [security] point score for [an] inmate which * * * is then \\\\nmatched with a commensurate security level institution.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 8.   \\\\n24.   Subject to certain caveats, an individual with a security point score between 0 and \\\\n11 security points is matched to a minimum security facility, between 12 and 15 security points to \\\\na low security facility, between 16 and 23 security points to a medium security facility, and 24 and \\\\nover security points to a high security facility.   See PS 5100.08 at 8.  \\\\n  6 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 7 of 33\\\\n25.   The BOP relies on a set of established factors to determine the security point score, \\\\nincluding \\u201cvoluntary surrender,\\u201d the \\u201cseverity of current offense,\\u201d \\u201chistory of violence,\\u201d \\u201chistory \\\\nof escape or attempts,\\u201d \\u201ctype of detainer,\\u201d \\u201cage,\\u201d \\u201ceducation level,\\u201d \\u201cdrug and alcohol abuse,\\u201d and \\\\n\\u201ccriminal history score.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 30\\u201338.   To calculate the total security point score, the \\\\nBOP adds up the points assigned to each of these criteria.   Id. at 41.   \\\\n26.   The BOP explains in Program Statement 5100.08 that the \\u201ccriminal history score\\u201d \\\\nis \\u201cone of the factors used to calculate the inmate\\u2019s security point total.\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 10.   \\\\n27.   The criminal history score is one of the most influential categories in determining \\\\nthe total security point total.   For example, while the \\u201cseverity of current offense\\u201d category can \\\\nincrease the security point by a maximum of seven points for the \\u201cgreatest\\u201d severity offense, the \\\\ncriminal history score can increase the security point score by ten points \\u2014 a difference large \\\\nenough on its own to move a prisoner from a low security facility to a high security facility.   See \\\\nPS 5100.08 at 8, 32\\u201333.  \\\\n28.   Program Statement 5100.08 establishes two systems for deriving criminal history \\\\nscores.  \\\\n29.   The vast majority of prisoners in BOP custody are convicted of federal offenses \\\\nand sentenced by federal district courts.   For those individuals \\u2014 referred to here as \\u201cindividuals \\\\nwith federal sentences\\u201d \\u2014 their \\u201c[criminal history score] is derived from the US Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines Criminal History Points, as reflected in the final judgment and the [statement of \\\\nreasons].   If not found in either the Judgment or [statement of reasons],\\u201d the BOP \\u201cuse[s] the points \\\\nassessed by the [United States Probation Office] in the [Presentence Report].\\u201d  PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n  7 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 8 of 33\\\\n30.   The BOP converts the Sentencing Guidelines criminal history points into a criminal \\\\nhistory score using the conversion table depicted below.   That criminal history score is then used \\\\nto determine the security point score.    \\\\nCriminal History Points  Criminal History Score \\\\n0 to 1 point  0 \\\\n2 to 3 points  2 \\\\n4 to 6 points  4 \\\\n7 to 9 points  6 \\\\n10 to 12 points  8 \\\\n13 or more points  10 \\\\n \\\\nPS 5100.08 at 33.   For instance, based on the table above, a person with five criminal history points \\\\nreceives a criminal history score of four.   See PS 5100.08 at 33.   \\\\n31.   For individuals in BOP custody who are sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court1 \\u2014 \\\\nreferred to here as \\u201cindividuals with D.C. sentences\\u201d \\u2014 the BOP applies a different rule set forth \\\\nin Program Statement 5100.08 to calculate their criminal history points, which is then converted \\\\nto a criminal history score pursuant to the conversion table in Paragraph 30.   See PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n32.   Unlike individuals with federal sentences, individuals with D.C. sentences do not \\\\nenter the BOP with \\u201cUS Sentencing Guidelines Criminal History Points\\u201d that are \\u201creflected in the \\\\nfinal judgment,\\u201d a judicial statement of reasons, or a Presentence Report.   PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n                                                 \\\\n1 Pursuant to the Revitalization Act, nearly all individuals sentenced to felonies by the D.C. \\\\nSuperior Court are immediately transferred to BOP custody to serve out their sentences.   For that \\\\nreason, individuals with D.C. Code convictions comprise the bulk of individuals affected by the \\\\nBOP\\u2019s rudimentary and arbitrary scoring scheme.   Because this lawsuit focuses on the unfair \\\\ntreatment of individuals with D.C. Code convictions, only that group will be referenced throughout \\\\nthe motion.   It is worth noting, however, that the criminal history scoring of individuals serving \\\\nother state or military tribunal sentences is equally unfair and arbitrary for the same reasons.  \\\\n  8 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 9 of 33\\\\n33.   Program  Statement  5100.08\\u2019s  rule  for  calculating  criminal  history  points  for \\\\nindividuals with D.C. sentences is materially different than the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\\\nhistory points calculation that the BOP relies on for individuals with federal sentences.    \\\\n34.   Under Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s rule for individuals with D.C. sentences, the \\\\nBOP does not rely on any previous calculation of criminal history points and undertakes the \\\\ncalculation itself after obtaining an \\u201cNCIC III Report,\\u201d a criminal history report derived from the \\\\nNational Crime Information Center database maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   \\\\nPS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n35.   After obtaining the NCIC III Report, Program Statement 5100.08 instructs the BOP \\\\nto calculate the criminal history points for individuals with D.C. sentences as follows: \\\\na. Add 3 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one \\\\nyear and one month; \\\\nb. Add 2 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least \\\\nsixty days not counted in (a); \\\\nc. Add 1 point for each prior conviction not counted in (a) or (b), up to \\\\na total of 4 points for this item; and, \\\\nd. Add 2 points if the instant offense is a revocation accompanied by a \\\\nnew state or federal conviction, or if the instant offense occurred \\\\nwhile under federal supervision including incarceration, probation, \\\\nparole or supervised release.  \\\\n \\\\nPS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n \\\\n36.   The BOP\\u2019s calculation of criminal history points under Program Statement 5100.08 \\\\nis then converted to a criminal history score based on the table depicted in Paragraph 30.   \\\\n37.   The system the BOP uses to calculate criminal history points for individuals with \\\\nD.C. sentences results in systematically higher criminal history scores than their similarly situated \\\\nfederal counterparts.   This leads to higher, more restrictive security designations for individuals \\\\nwith D.C. sentences as compared to individuals with federal sentences that have identical criminal \\\\nhistories.  \\\\n  9 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 10 of 33\\\\n38.   The Sentencing Guidelines generally does not award criminal history points for the \\\\nfollowing categories of offenses and sentences whereas the BOP\\u2019s scoring rule contains no such \\\\nexceptions or limitations:  \\\\na.  Stale offenses and sentences \\\\nb.  Petty offenses \\\\nc.  Juvenile offenses \\\\nd.  Suspended sentences \\\\ne.  Multiple sentences for offenses in the same charging instrument or that were \\\\nsentenced on the same day \\\\n \\\\nStale offenses and sentences \\\\n \\\\n39.   The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards three points for a \\u201cprior sentence of \\\\nimprisonment exceeding one year and one month\\u201d that was \\u201cimposed within fifteen years of the \\\\ndefendant\\u2019s  commencement  of  the  instant  offense.\\u201d  United  States  Sentencing  Commission, \\\\nGuidelines Manual, \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(a), 4A1.2(e)(1) (emphasis added).   This includes any sentence \\\\n\\u201cexceeding one year and one month, whenever imposed, that resulted in the [individual] being \\\\nincarcerated during any part of such fifteen-year period.\\u201d  Id. \\\\n40.   In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards three points for \\\\n\\u201ceach prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month\\u201d regardless of when that \\\\nsentence was imposed, PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n41.   The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards two points for \\u201ceach prior sentence of \\\\nimprisonment of at least sixty days not counted in [\\u00a74A1.1(a)],\\u201d USSG \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(b), only if that \\\\nsentence \\u201cwas imposed within ten years of the defendant\\u2019s commencement of the instant offense,\\u201d \\\\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2) (emphasis added).  \\\\n42.   In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards two points \\u201cfor \\\\neach prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days [but not greater than one year and one \\\\nmonth],\\u201d regardless of when that sentence was imposed.

The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines awards one point for \\u201cfor each prior sentence not \\\\ncounted in [\\u00a7 4A1.1](a) or [\\u00a7 4A1.1](b), up to a total of 4 points,\\u201d USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(c), only if that \\\\nsentence \\u201cwas imposed within ten years of the defendant\\\\'s commencement of the instant offense,\\u201d  \\\\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2).  \\\\n44.   In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards one point \\u201cfor \\\\neach prior conviction not [previously] counted * * * up to a total of 4 points for this item,\\u201d \\\\nregardless of when that sentence was imposed.   PS 5100.08 at 33.   \\\\n45.   Consider an individual with a D.C. sentence who committed their \\u201cinstant offense\\u201d \\\\non January 1, 2015 and had the following criminal history: \\\\na.  Two-year prison sentence imposed on January 1, 1980 \\\\nb.  Six-month prison sentence imposed on January 1, 1984 \\\\nc.  Three-month probationary sentence imposed on January 1, 1986 \\\\n \\\\nUnder the BOP\\u2019s rule, that person would receive a total of six criminal history points (three points \\\\nfor the 1980 sentence, two points for the 1984 sentence, and one point for the 1986 sentence) for \\\\na criminal history score of four.   See PS 5100.08 at 33; supra \\u00b6 35.   \\\\n46.   A  similarly  situated  individual  with  a  federal  sentence  who  had  an  identical \\\\ncriminal history and an identical instant offense would receive zero criminal history points \\u2014 a \\\\ncriminal history score of zero \\u2014 because each of the three sentences imposed would be considered \\\\nstale and not count under the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal history points calculation.  \\\\n47.   Because Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s rule does not contain a staleness exception \\\\nfor individuals with D.C. sentences, unlike the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 points calculation for \\\\nindividuals with federal sentences, the BOP\\u2019s rule systematically results in higher criminal history \\\\npoints and higher criminal history scores for Plaintiff and proposed class members, as compared \\\\nto similarly situated individuals with federal sentences.    \\\\n  11 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 12 of 33\\\\nPetty offenses \\\\n48.

Under the Sentencing Guidelines, certain \\u201cprior offenses and offenses similar to \\\\nthem,\\u201d including \\u201c[p]ublic intoxication,\\u201d \\u201c[l]oitering,\\u201d and \\u201c[v]agrancy,\\u201d are \\u201cnever counted\\u201d in a \\\\ncriminal history score.   USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2).  \\\\n50.   Under the Sentencing Guidelines, other \\u201cprior offenses and offenses similar to \\\\nthem,\\u201d  including  \\u201creckless  driving,\\u201d  \\u201c[t]respassing,\\u201d  \\u201c[c]ontempt  of  court,\\u201d  or  \\u201c[d]isorderly \\\\nconduct,\\u201d are \\u201ccounted only if (A) the sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or \\\\na term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an instant \\\\noffense.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1).  \\\\n51.   In contrast, for individuals with D.C. sentences, the BOP awards criminal history \\\\npoints regardless of type of prior offense.   See PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n52.   For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a prior public intoxication \\\\noffense would receive criminal history points where as an individual with a federal sentence with \\\\na similar prior conviction would not.  \\\\n53.   Likewise, an individual with a D.C. sentence with an instant drug sale offense and \\\\na prior conviction for driving without a license offense for which they received a sentence of 10 \\\\ndays of imprisonment would receive criminal history points, and potentially a higher criminal \\\\nhistory score, that a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence would not.  \\\\n54.   As a result of this material difference in treatment of prior offenses, individuals \\\\nwith D.C. sentences systematically receive higher criminal history points, and therefore higher \\\\n  12 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 13 of 33\\\\ncriminal  history  scores,  as  compared  to  similarly  situated  federal  counterparts.  \\\\nJuvenile offenses \\\\n55.   The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines limit the awarding of criminal history points for \\\\nprior offenses committed as a juvenile.   See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(c).   \\\\n56.   The  Sentencing  Guidelines  award  two  criminal  history  points  for  each  prior \\\\njuvenile offense that resulted in \\u201cconfinement of at least sixty days\\u201d only when \\u201cthe defendant was \\\\nreleased from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense.\\u201d \\\\nUSSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(A).  \\\\n57.   The Sentencing Guidelines award one criminal history point for each prior juvenile \\\\noffense that did not result in confinement of at least sixty days only if the \\u201csentence [was] imposed \\\\nwithin  five  years  of  the  defendant\\u2019s  commencement  of  the  instant  offense.\\u201d  USSG \\\\n\\u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(B).  \\\\n58.   While the Sentencing Guidelines award criminal history points only for juvenile \\\\noffenses imposed within a limited period of time, the BOP awards criminal history points for all \\\\njuvenile offenses without any limitations, see PS 5100.08 at 33.    \\\\n59.   For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a 1995 juvenile sentence that \\\\nresulted in ninety days\\u2019 imprisonment will receive two criminal history points, and a higher \\\\ncriminal history score, than a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence.   \\\\n60.   As a result of this material difference in treatment of juvenile offenses, individuals \\\\nwith D.C. sentences systematically receive higher criminal history points, and potentially higher \\\\ncriminal history scores, as compared to similarly situated federal counterparts.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  13 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 14 of 33\\\\nSuspended sentences \\\\n61.   The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines award three, two, or one criminal history points \\\\nfor each prior conviction depending on the length of sentence for those convictions.   See USSG \\\\n\\u00a7 4A1.1(a)-(c).  \\\\n62.   To determine the length of sentence for prior convictions where \\u201cpart of a sentence \\\\nof imprisonment was suspended,\\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines consider only \\u201cthe portion that was \\\\nnot suspended.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(b)(2).   \\\\n63.   Like the Sentencing Guidelines, for individuals with D.C. sentences, Program \\\\nStatement 5100.08 also awards three, two, or one criminal history points for each prior conviction \\\\ndepending on the length of sentence for those prior convictions.   See PS 5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n64.   Unlike the Sentencing Guidelines, the BOP considers the total length of sentence \\\\nof those prior convictions regardless of whether a portion of that sentence was suspended.   See PS \\\\n5100.08 at 33.  \\\\n65.   For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence with a prior sentence of two years\\u2019 \\\\nimprisonment, suspended as to all but two months, would receive three criminal history points \\\\nunder Program Statement 5100.08.   By contrast, an individual with a federal sentence with the \\\\nsame prior sentence would receive only one criminal history point, and only if that prior conviction \\\\nwas an applicable offense and did not fall within the staleness exception.   \\\\n66.   As a result of this material difference in the treatment of suspended sentences, \\\\nindividuals  with  D.C.  sentences  systematically  receive  higher  criminal  history  points,  and \\\\ntherefore higher criminal history scores, as compared to similarly situated federal counterparts.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  14 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 15 of 33\\\\nMultiple sentences for offenses in the same charging instrument or that were sentenced on \\\\nthe same day \\\\n \\\\n67.   The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines treat certain prior sentences as a single sentence.   \\\\n68.   Under the Sentencing Guidelines, prior sentences that were not separated by an \\\\nintervening arrest are counted as one sentence for purposes of calculating criminal history points \\\\nif they \\u201cresulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument\\u201d or if \\u201cthe sentences \\\\nwere imposed on the same day.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).  \\\\n69.   By contrast, Program Statement 5100.08 treats all prior sentences as separate \\\\nsentences for purposes of calculating criminal history points.  \\\\n70.   For instance, an individual with a D.C. sentence who previously received two \\\\nconcurrent sentences of 24 months\\u2019 imprisonment for two counts of possession of cocaine charged \\\\nin the same indictment would receive six criminal history points under Program Statement 5100.08 \\\\nbecause each sentence of 24 months would count as three points.   See PS 5100.08 at 33.   By \\\\ncontrast, a similarly situated individual with a federal sentence would only receive three criminal \\\\nhistory points under the same scenario because the Sentencing Guidelines would treat the two \\\\nconcurrent 24-month sentences as a sentence that \\u201cresulted from offenses contained in the same \\\\ncharging instrument.\\u201d  USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).  \\\\n71.   As a result of this material difference in treatment of sentences contained in the \\\\nsame  charging  instrument  or  charged  on  the  same  day,  individuals  with  D.C.  sentences \\\\nsystematically receive higher criminal history points, and therefore higher criminal history scores, \\\\nas compared to their similarly situated federal counterparts.  \\\\n72.   In addition to greatly determining security designations, the BOP\\u2019s criminal history \\\\nscore also plays a significant role in determining a prisoner\\u2019s PATTERN risk assessment score.  \\\\n  15 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 16 of 33\\\\n73.

Had Mr. Blades been scored according to the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 criminal \\\\nhistory points calculation, he would only have received three criminal history points, resulting \\\\nin a criminal history score of two: \\\\na.  Mr. Blades would receive one point for his 2006 adult convictions for possessing a \\\\ncontrolled substance offense and driving while intoxicated offense (conviction (f) \\\\nin paragraph 83) because there was no intervening arrest and he was sentenced on \\\\nthe same day for both offenses, see USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2).  \\\\nb.

In part because of Mr. Blades\\u2019 arbitrarily higher criminal history score, he is being \\\\nincarcerated in a high security facility (USP) in the BOP.  \\\\n93.   As a result of his incarceration in a high security facility, Mr. Blades is stigmatized \\\\nand treated worse than identically situated incarcerated people solely because of the court in which \\\\nhe was convicted.  \\\\n94.   Mr. Blades has less access to educational and vocational programming at a high \\\\nsecurity facility compared to people incarcerated at lower security facilities.  \\\\n95.

Mr. Buchanan would have received four points for his 2008 conviction for one \\\\ncount of aggravated assault and one count of carrying a dangerous weapon \\u2014 three \\\\npoints for the carrying a dangerous weapon count, because that count resulted in a \\\\nsentence of incarceration over one year and one month, see USSG \\u00a7\\u00a7 4A1.1(a), \\\\n4A1.2(e)(2), and one point for the aggravated assault under the catch-all provision \\\\nthat \\u201c[a]dd[s] one point for each prior sentence resulting from a conviction of a \\\\ncrime of violence that did not [already] receive any points * * * because such \\\\nsentence was treated as a single sentence,\\u201d USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(e).  \\\\nd.  Mr. Buchanan would have received one point for his 2014 conviction for possession \\\\nwith intent to distribute marijuana.   See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(c).  \\\\n  23 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 24 of 33\\\\ne.  Mr. Buchanan would have received two points for committing the instant offense \\\\nwhile under supervision.   See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.1(e).  \\\\n117.   Mr. Buchanan would not receive any points under the Sentencing Guidelines for \\\\nhis 2002 conviction for possession of marijuana because it is outside the Sentencing Guidelines\\u2019 \\\\n10-year look-back period.   See USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2).  \\\\n118.   Mr. Buchanan would not receive any points under the Sentencing Guidelines for \\\\nhis 2004 convictions for one count of operating a vehicle with a suspended license and one count \\\\nof  operating  an  unregistered  vehicle  because  those  convictions  are  outside  the  Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines\\u2019 ten-year look-back period, see USSG \\u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2).  \\\\n119.   Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s criminal history score is unjustifiably higher than what it would be \\\\nif he were scored under the Sentencing Guidelines and has contributed to his incarceration in a \\\\nhigh security USP.    \\\\n120.   As  a  result  of  his  incarceration  in  a  high  security  facility,  Mr.  Buchanan  is \\\\nstigmatized and treated worse than identically situated incarcerated people solely because of the \\\\ncourt in which he was convicted.  \\\\n121.   Mr.  Buchanan  has  significantly  less  access  to  educational  and  vocational \\\\nprogramming at a high security facility compared to people incarcerated at lower security facility.   \\\\n122.   Mr. Buchanan has sought to enroll in a forklift operation course at his high security \\\\nfacility, but one is not available at that facility while it is available at medium and low security \\\\nfacilities.   \\\\n123.   Mr. Buchanan is unable to earn as much money at his prison job in his high security \\\\nfacility than he would be if he were held at a medium or low security facility.  \\\\n  24 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 25 of 33\\\\n124.   Mr. Buchanan has fewer opportunities to speak to his family and loved ones at his \\\\nhigh security facility than residents at medium or low security facilities have to speak to their \\\\nfamilies and loved ones.  \\\\n125.   Mr. Buchanan has fewer opportunities to leave his cell and to breathe fresh air \\\\noutside than residents at medium or low security facilities.   \\\\n126.   Mr. Buchanan is unable to practice his religion to the same extent as residents at a \\\\nmedium or low security facility are able to practice the same religion, in part because high security \\\\nfacilities  have  fewer  chaplains  and  fewer  religious  resources  than  medium  or  low  security \\\\nfacilities.   \\\\n127.   Mr. Buchanan is seeking transfer to a medium or low security facility and release \\\\nto home confinement.   \\\\n128.   Mr.  Buchanan\\u2019s  PATTERN  score is  also  higher  than  similarly  situated  BOP \\\\nresidents, meaning that Mr. Buchanan will earn fewer good time credits and serve a longer prison \\\\nsentence  than  residents  whose  criminal  history  scores  are  calculated  under  the  Sentencing \\\\nGuidelines.  \\\\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \\\\n129.   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), Jonathan Blades \\\\nand Antwan Buchanan bring this action as a class consisting of all people who are or will be \\\\nconvicted of District of Columbia code offenses who were sentenced from the Superior Court of \\\\nthe District of Columbia and who are held in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.  \\\\n130.   Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend the class definition or to establish sub-classes \\\\nas appropriate if discovery or further investigation reveals that the class should be expanded  \\\\n  25 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 26 of 33\\\\n131.   Numerosity: The class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable.   While the \\\\nprecise size of the class is unknown and is constantly changing, Plaintiffs believe that roughly \\\\n3,500 people currently fit the class definition, although the composition of the class changes daily.    \\\\n132.   Joinder of these thousands of people is impractical because the number of unnamed, \\\\nfuture class members who will be subject to the challenged policy is unknown and unknowable.    \\\\n133.   Proposed class members are highly unlikely to file individual suits on their own \\\\nbehalf given the practical, legal, and monetary difficulties that prevent incarcerated people serving \\\\nsentences in the BOP from accessing independent counsel.  \\\\n134.   Commonality: The claims of the class share common issues of law, including but \\\\nnot limited to whether the challenged policy violates the APA and the Fifth Amendment.  \\\\n135.   Typicality: The claims of Jonathan Blades and Antwan Buchanan are typical of \\\\nthose of the class as a whole because their criminal history points were assessed under the \\\\nchallenged policy and they would receive lower criminal history points, a lower criminal history \\\\nscore, and lower security point score, if they were scored the same as similarly situated BOP \\\\nresidents who were sentenced by a federal district court. \\\\n136.   Adequacy: Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives who meet all requirements \\\\nof Rule 23(a)(4).   They have no conflict of interest with other class members and will fairly and \\\\nadequately protect the interests of the class.  \\\\n137.   Plaintiffs\\u2019 counsel will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class, and counsel \\\\nhave experience with the factual and legal issues litigated in this case, as well as with representing \\\\nplaintiffs in federal civil rights class actions.   \\\\n138.   Defendant has acted and will act on grounds generally applicable to the class, \\\\nthereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a whole.   This is \\\\n  26 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 27 of 33\\\\nbecause Defendant\\u2019s actions were taken pursuant to a policy and practice of the BOP.   A permanent \\\\ninjunction of the policy will therefore benefit all class members.  \\\\nCAUSES OF ACTION \\\\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\\\nARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTION IN VIOLATION OF THE \\\\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\\\n \\\\n139.   The APA requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful and set aside agency \\\\naction\\u201d that is \\u201carbitrary,\\u201d \\u201ccapricious,\\u201d or \\u201can abuse of discretion.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(A).    \\\\n140.   The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is an \\u201cagency\\u201d under the APA.   5 U.S.C. \\\\n\\u00a7 551(1).  \\\\n141.   The  BOP\\u2019s  criminal  history  scoring  scheme,  set  forth  in  Program  Statement \\\\n5100.08, is final agency action that is reviewable under the APA because it represents the end of \\\\nthe agency\\u2019s decisionmaking process and creates legal consequences, namely, the increased \\\\nlikelihood  of  more  restrictions  on  liberty,  unconstitutionally  disparate  treatment  and \\\\nstigmatization, and other harmful effects on Plaintiffs and proposed class members.  \\\\n142.   Program  Statement  5100.08\\u2019s  criminal  history  scoring  rule  for  individuals \\\\nsentenced by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse \\\\nof discretion because the BOP failed to consider significant disparities between its scheme and the \\\\nU.S. Sentencing Guideline\\u2019s scoring rules for individuals with federal sentences.   The BOP also \\\\nfailed to consider how these differences result in systematically higher criminal history scores and \\\\nsecurity  point  scores  for  individuals  with  D.C.  sentences,  which  contributes  to  their \\\\ndisproportionate placement in higher security facilities.  \\\\n143.   The BOP also failed to consider the discriminatory racial impacts of such a policy \\\\nas the overwhelming majority of individuals sentenced by the D.C. Superior Court are Black, and \\\\n  27 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 28 of 33\\\\nthe BOP\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule contributes to these individuals having higher criminal \\\\nhistory scores, higher security classifications, and more restrictive housing placements.    \\\\n144.   Defendants\\u2019 decision, in the challenged policy, to treat Plaintiffs and proposed class \\\\nmembers more harshly than their federal counterparts is arbitrary and capricious.  \\\\n145.   Defendants\\u2019 policy causes Plaintiffs and proposed class members injuries because \\\\nit subjects them to unconstitutional and discriminatory treatment, unduly restricts their liberty, \\\\ndenies them programming opportunities, and subjects them to institutions with greater incidents \\\\nof violence.    \\\\n146.   The challenged policy violates the APA because it is arbitrary and capricious and \\\\nit therefore must be set aside.  \\\\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\\\nACTION CONTRARY TO LAW, IN VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE \\\\nPROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\\\n \\\\n147.   The Administrative Procedure Act requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful \\\\nand set aside agency action\\u201d that is \\u201cotherwise not in accordance with law.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(A).    \\\\n148.   The BOP\\u2019s Criminal History Score policy violates the APA because it is \\u201cnot in \\\\naccordance with law\\u201d\\u2014in this case, the BOP\\u2019s own regulation that it \\u201cshall not discriminate \\\\nagainst inmates on the basis of race * * * [in] the making of administrative decisions and providing \\\\naccess to work, housing and programs.\\u201d 28 C.F.R. \\u00a7 551.90.  \\\\n149.   The overwhelming number of individuals sentenced by D.C. Superior Court \\u2014 \\\\nover 95 percent \\u2014 are Black.  The BOP closely maintains statistics on the race of its residents and \\\\nis aware that policies affecting individuals with D.C. sentences would impact a majority Black \\\\npopulation.   Therefore, Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule \\u2014 which \\\\nresults in higher criminal history scores and more restrictive housing \\u2014 disproportionately affects \\\\n  28 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 29 of 33\\\\nBlack residents in BOP\\u2019s custody as compared to its majority-white federal population, in violation \\\\nof the BOP\\u2019s own anti-discrimination housing regulations.  \\\\n150.   Because Program Statement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule violates the \\\\nBOP\\u2019s own regulation, it violates the APA\\u2019s lawfulness requirement and must be set aside.  \\\\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\\\nACTION CONTRARY TO CONSTITUITONAL RIGHT, IN VIOLATION OF THE \\\\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\\\n \\\\n151.   The Administrative Procedure Act requires the \\u201creviewing court\\u201d to \\u201chold unlawful \\\\nand  set  aside  agency  action\\u201d  that  is  \\u201ccontrary  to  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or \\\\nimmunity.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(B).    \\\\n152.   The BOP\\u2019s Criminal History Score policy violates the APA because it is \\u201ccontrary \\\\nto constitutional right\\u201d\\u2014in this case, the Fifth Amendment\\u2019s right to equal protection.    This claim \\\\nincorporates all of the points raised with regards to the Constitutional claim, see infra \\u00b6\\u00b6 154\\u2013160.    \\\\n153.   Because Program Statement 5100.08 violates the Fifth Amendment, it also runs \\\\nafoul of the APA\\u2019s requirement that rules not conflict with constitutional rights and privileges.  \\\\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\\\nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE \\\\nFIFTH AMENDMENT \\\\n \\\\n154.   The Fifth Amendment precludes the federal government from treating similarly \\\\nsituated parties differently for no rational reason.   See 3883 Connecticut LLC v. District of \\\\nColumbia, 336 F.3d 1068, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Fraternal Order of Police v. United States, 152 \\\\nF.3d 998, 1002 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (\\u201cEqual protection analysis is substantially identical under the \\\\nFifth Amendment and the Fourteenth.\\u201d), reh\\u2019g granted on other grounds, 173 F.3d 898 (D.C. Cir. \\\\n1999).  \\\\n  29 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 30 of 33\\\\n155.   Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class  members,  who  were  sentenced  to  a  term  of \\\\nimprisonment by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, are similarly situated to other \\\\nBOP residents who were sentenced to a term of imprisonment by any of the federal district courts.   \\\\nBy law, individuals \\u201csentenced pursuant to the D.C. Code * * * shall be subject to any law or \\\\nregulation applicable to persons committed for violations of laws of the United States * * * and \\\\nthe Bureau of Prisons shall be responsible for [their] custody[. ]\\u201d  D.C. Code \\u00a7 24-101.   Therefore, \\\\npursuant to District of Columbia law, individuals sentenced by the Superior Court are intended to \\\\nbe \\u201csubject\\u201d to the same treatment as individuals sentenced by any of the federal district courts \\\\nand the BOP is charged with their custody and equal treatment.  \\\\n156.   There is no rational basis to treat Plaintiffs and proposed class members differently \\\\nthan BOP residents sentenced by federal district courts with regards to housing, programming \\\\nopportunities, and eligibility for home confinement.    \\\\n157.   Defendants\\u2019  policy  violates  the  Fifth  Amendment  because  it  treats  similarly \\\\nsituated parties disparately without a rational basis to do so.   \\\\n158.   The BOP acted without rational basis and contrary to equal protection principles \\\\nwhen it implemented a policy that significantly and disparately impacted the 95 percent Black \\\\npopulation of individuals with D.C. sentences.   By subjecting the majority Black population of \\\\nindividuals with D.C. sentences to a harsher criminal history scoring system, these individuals \\\\nhave systematically higher criminal history scores, higher security classifications, and more \\\\nrestrictive housing placements, than their majority-white federal counterparts.    \\\\n159.   Because of Defendants\\u2019 policy, Plaintiff and proposed class are more likely to be \\\\ndesignated to higher security level facilities with more rigorous constraints on their liberty, less \\\\n  30 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 31 of 33\\\\naccess to programming and work opportunities, less access to religious services, and more \\\\nviolence.   \\\\n160.   As a direct and proximate result of Defendants\\u2019 conduct, Plaintiff and the proposed \\\\nclass have suffered and will continue to suffer harm that is irreparable because the BOP\\u2019s criminal \\\\nhistory scoring rule is controlling and Plaintiff and the proposed class are unable to challenge their \\\\ncriminal history score, security classification, or facility designation in court. \\\\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \\\\nACTION WITHOUT OBSERVANCE OF PROCEDURE REQUIRED BY LAW IN \\\\nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 500 ET SEQ. \\\\n \\\\n161.   The APA requires the reviewing court \\u201cto hold unlawful and set aside\\u201d agency \\\\naction promulgated \\u201cwithout observance of procedure required by law.\\u201d  5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2)(D).  \\\\n162.   The APA requires that legislative rules undergo a notice and comment period as \\\\npart of the rulemaking process.   5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 553.  \\\\n163.   The Defendants\\u2019 criminal history scoring rule (Program Statement 5100.08) is a \\\\nbinding,  legislative  rule  that  has  the  force  and  effect  of  law  because  it  provides  concrete, \\\\ncontrolling, singular guidance for calculating criminal history score, which has a direct and \\\\nsignificant impact on security classifications and places of imprisonment.    \\\\n164.   Defendants did not undergo a notice and comment period when adopting Program \\\\nStatement 5100.08\\u2019s criminal history scoring rule, and thus, the public, key stakeholders, including \\\\nfederal and D.C. agencies involved in criminal justice work, and those subject to the rule, could \\\\nnot participate or comment on the rule or its wide-ranging effects.  \\\\n165.   The challenged policy violates the APA and must be set aside because the BOP did \\\\nnot observe the required notice and comment process before adopting the policy.    \\\\n \\\\n  31 \\\\n\\\\nCase 1:22-cv-00279-CRC   Document 1   Filed 02/03/22   Page 32 of 33\\\\nRELIEF REQUESTED \\\\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \\\\na.  Declare that the criminal history scoring rule for individuals with D.C. sentences \\\\npresented in Program Statement 5100.08, ch. 4, \\u00a7 8, is: \\\\n\\u2022  An arbitrary and capricious action, in violation of the Administrative Procedure \\\\nAct, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\\\n\\u2022  An action not in accordance with the law, in violation of the Administrative \\\\nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\\\n\\u2022  An  action  not  in  accordance  with  the  Constitution,  in  violation  of  the \\\\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; \\\\n\\u2022  An action promulgated without observance of procedure required by law, in \\\\nviolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 701-706; and \\\\n\\u2022  Unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.   \\\\nb.  Vacate and set aside the separate criminal history scoring rule set forth in Program \\\\nStatement 5100.08, ch. 4, \\u00a7 8; \\\\nc.  Grant a preliminary injunction and permanent injunction preventing Defendant, its \\\\nsubordinates, agents, and employees from assessing the criminal history score of \\\\nindividuals sentenced by D.C.

The district court held that conditions in the\\\\nOklahoma prison system violated the Eighth Amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.  The\\\\n[1]\\\\nsubsequent history of the controversy is detailed in the opinions cited in the margin. \\\\nIn April, 1982, the district court entered an order that defendants \\\"should have and do hereby have the authority\\\\nindefinitely but not permanently to double-cell where necessary,\\\" 708 F.2d 1523 at 1526, following increases in\\\\nthe Oklahoma prison population.  In October, 1982, the district court issued an opinion following an evidentiary\\\\nhearing on its orders that had previously been entered.  The court stated that although it would not conclude from\\\\nthe evidence that the system had become unconstitutional in its operation, it was clearly in a state of decline.  708\\\\n1423 F.2d at 1539.  The court continued jurisdiction over the case to insure that the Oklahoma prison system did *1423\\\\nnot revert to an unconstitutional condition.  Id. The court ordered that a statement of penal policy and detailed plan\\\\nof action be filed. \\\\nThis court affirmed, one judge dissenting.  Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d 1523 (10th Cir.1983),cert. dismissed,465\\\\nU.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1019, 79 L.Ed.2d 248 (1984).  The majority of the panel held that the district court did not\\\\nabuse its discretion in continuing its jurisdiction to assure compliance with past decrees and to prevent a\\\\nrecurrence of unconstitutional conditions despite its finding that the system was then currently constitutional.  Id.\\\\nat 1537-40. \\\\nThe instant controversy concerns events following that decision.  In compliance with the district court\\\\'s order, the\\\\nState filed a detailed \\\"Plan of Measures to be Taken to Assure Continued Constitutionality of Oklahoma\\\\'s Prisons\\\"\\\\nin June, 1983, and in July the State filed a supplement to the Plan.  In September, 1983, the court held an\\\\nevidentiary hearing on the State\\\\'s Plan and the State\\\\'s motion to dismiss the case. Judge Bohanon recused in\\\\nDecember, 1983, and the case was assigned to Chief Judge Seay.  Following review of a portion of the record, he\\\\nentered the order on appeal herein on December 30. \\\\n\\\\nThe court concluded that \\\"since October 1982 to the present date the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma\\\\nprison system are constitutional and are not cruel and unusual punishment.\\\" X Jt.App. 237.  The court noted that\\\\nthere had been \\\"disturbances, problems, and inadequacies in the Oklahoma prison system since the court\\\\'s last\\\\nfindings.\\\" Id. at 235.  The court noted that there were four subjects of previous court orders still found to be\\\\ninadequate and not in compliance 00 racial integration, access to the courts, equal protection guarantees for\\\\n97\\\\nwomen, and vacating for human habitation the East and West Cellhouses of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\\\nMcAlester.  Id.\\\\nThe court concluded nevertheless that the system was constitutional and \\\"each area of continued violation has\\\\nbeen specifically addressed by the State and is subject to a specifically planned remedy.\\\" Id. The court found that\\\\nthe State legislature and prison officials were aware of and sensitive to the constitutional requirements and that\\\\nthe court was satisfied \\\"that there is no reasonable expectation that unconstitutional practices will recur in the\\\\nconditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system.\\\" Id. at 238.  Concluding that it was mindful of its\\\\nobligation to enforce the constitutional rights of all persons, the court granted defendants\\\\' motion to dismiss the\\\\ncase in its entirety.  However, the court concluded that \\\"[a]ll of this court\\\\'s orders and injunctions as modified\\\\nheretofore remain in full force and effect.\\\" Id. at 239. \\\\nIn May, 1984, the district court denied a motion by plaintiffs to stay the dismissal order.  Responding to a\\\\ncomplaint that the judge had not had the full record to review, the judge noted that he had had four of seven\\\\ntranscripts from the September hearing for review before entering the order; that he had all the transcripts\\\\ncontaining plaintiffs\\\\' case-in-chief; and that he had earlier had the transcript volume with the testimony of the\\\\nGovernor and the Director of the Corrections Department.  In denying the request for a stay, the court concluded\\\\nthat \\\"[a]fter a careful review and study of the entire transcript, the court finds no reason to change its order of\\\\nDecember 30, 1983, and the court reaffirms that order.\\\" Id. at 248.  The court stated that \\\"[a]lthough the court\\\\nnoted problems of compliance in certain areas, those areas were not held to be constitutional violations.\\\" Id.\\\\n(emphasis in original). \\\\nOn April 25, 1984, a panel of this court denied an application by the plaintiffs for a stay of the dismissal order,\\\\npending appeal.  On May 25, 1985, plaintiffs filed a further motion for a stay of the dismissal order, pending\\\\nappeal, contending that the State was housing inmates in the East and West Cellhouses in violation of the district\\\\ncourt\\\\'s order of May, 1979.  The State responded that the inmates were temporarily housed in those cellhouses\\\\n1424 on May 13, 1985, as a result of a disturbance at another *1424 State prison, and that the inmates were removed\\\\nfrom them on May 28.  Plaintiffs did not dispute these facts but did request that this court stay the dismissal order\\\\nnevertheless.  We denied the renewed application for a stay, stating that we would \\\"consider the propriety and\\\\nscope of the district court\\\\'s December 30, 1983, order in our disposition of the pending appeal in this cause.\\\" A\\\\nmotion to reconsider that ruling was filed, but in view of our disposition of the case the motion becomes moot.\\\\nWe turn now to the appellate arguments challenging the correctness of the district court\\\\'s order of dismissal. \\\\nII\\\\nPlaintiffs challenge the district court\\\\'s holding that the prison system is constitutional.  They argue that the system\\\\nis unconstitutional with respect to access to the courts, racial integration, and equal protection guarantees for\\\\nwomen 00 areas that the district court found to be \\\"inadequate and not in compliance\\\" with previous court orders. \\\\n97\\\\nPlaintiffs also contend that the Oklahoma prison system, considering the totality of the circumstances, is in\\\\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment. \\\\nA.\\\\n\\\\nAccess to the courts\\\\n[2]\\\\nPlaintiffs attack the defendants\\\\' reliance on inmate law clerks to provide meaningful access to the courts.   Brief\\\\nof Appellant 40-42; Reply Brief of Appellants 18-20.  We have previously noted, however, that \\\"[u]nder Bounds,\\\\nthe State is free to make a choice between affording law library facilities on a reasonable basis, or the alternative\\\\nmeans of having available counsel on a reasonable basis.\\\" Ward v. Kort, 762 F.2d 856, 860 (10th Cir.1985).  The\\\\ndistrict court\\\\'s dismissal order stated:\\\\nThe court finds that the mandated minimums of adequate library facilities has not yet been met. \\\\nBounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 [97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72] (1976).  However, testimony from\\\\nMr. Larry Meachum, Director of the Department of Corrections of Oklahoma, at the September\\\\n1983 hearing, indicates and assures this court that libraries will be fully stocked and that plaintiffs\\\\nhave and will be assured continued access to courts. \\\\nX Jt.App. 235.  In this connection, the defendants\\\\' Plan stated that the State intended \\\"to continue their current\\\\napproach to access to courts by providing both law libraries and trained inmate law clerks to assist inmates in\\\\nframing legal issues for presentation to the court.\\\" X R. 113; see id. at 113-14. \\\\nThere is record evidence that the Department of Corrections has a large or small library at each of the prison\\\\nfacilities.  Inventories were admitted in evidence as Defendants\\\\' Exhibits 29, 30, and 31 respecting the major law\\\\nlibraries at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center, and the Joseph Harp\\\\nCorrectional Center.  V Jt.App. 1041.  Each library has a supervisor.  The fact finder appointed by the district court\\\\nhad found an \\\"appalling lack of essential legal books and reference materials at both major and minor law\\\\nlibraries.\\\" VIII Jt.App. 119.  However, we note that the inventories do list a substantial volume of basic materials in\\\\nthe libraries.  See, e.g., Defendants\\\\' Exhibit 29 (containing extensive listing of law books at Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary Library).  Further, defendants\\\\' Plan represented to the court that \\\"the Department is continually\\\\n[3]\\\\nupdating and supplementing its law library inventories.\\\" X Jt.App. 114. \\\\n1425 *1425 In light of the testimony, the documentary evidence, and the representations accepted by the district court,\\\\nwe hold that the finding of the court that there was no constitutional violation in this respect is not in error. \\\\nB.\\\\nThe claim of racial discrimination\\\\nEarlier practices of racial discrimination in the Oklahoma prison system were chronicled in Battle v. Anderson,\\\\n376 F.Supp. at 410-11.  In that opinion, the district court made conclusions of law on these practices, id. at\\\\n420-21, and entered orders designed to remedy the discrimination.  Id. at 428-30.  The State has endeavored\\\\nsince those orders to comply with the constitutional requirements. \\\\nIn the instant proceeding there are numerous allegations of racial discrimination and segregation in the\\\\nOklahoma prison system, including discrimination in job assignments, dining hall seating, and cell assignments. \\\\nNumerous examples are contained in the fact finder\\\\'s March 1983 final compliance report, VIII Jt.App. 25-43, and\\\\nin the arguments and record citations in the briefs of the plaintiffs-appellants in this phase of the controversy. \\\\nBrief of Appellants 15-16, 43; Reply Brief of Appellants 12-14.  The State and the United States as intervenor\\\\nargue that the evidence supports a finding of nondiscrimination.  Brief of State Defendants-Appellees 101-02;\\\\nBrief for the United States as Appellee 26-28. \\\\nIn addition, the plaintiffs-appellants argue that the trial court did not address these issues in the December 30,\\\\n1983 order of dismissal.  In that regard, we note that the district court did make the following findings and\\\\nconclusions respecting this claim of racial discrimination:\\\\n\\\\nRacial integration of the occupants of double cells is found to be almost non-existent in the\\\\nOklahoma prison system.  Racial integration of cells is strictly by voluntary action only.  However, a\\\\ncommitment by defendants to fully integrate is contained in the Defendants\\\\' Plan.  The court finds\\\\nthe Defendants\\\\' Plan to be of sufficient remedial effect and has previously, in this order, approved\\\\nand ordered its adoption. \\\\nX Jt.App. 235. \\\\nIn view of the findings quoted above, we cannot agree with the plaintiffs-appellants that the trial court did not\\\\naddress the racial discrimination claim at all. Nevertheless, because of the several distinct questions clearly\\\\nraised by the fact finder\\\\'s findings and the specific issues joined by the parties, we must agree that the findings of\\\\nthe district court are not sufficient under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.  We cannot perform our appellate function\\\\nwithout adequate findings and conclusions by the trial court on this issue of fundamental constitutional\\\\nimportance.  Battle v. Anderson, 614 F.2d 251, 256 (10th Cir.1980); Squirtco v. Seven-Up Co., 628 F.2d 1086,\\\\n1902 (8th Cir.1980).  Without expressing any view on the validity of the constitutional claim of racial discrimination,\\\\nwe hold that the findings and conclusions thereon are not sufficient due to the sharp conflict on the several claims\\\\nof specific discriminatory treatment not addressed by the trial judge.\\\\nAccordingly, with respect to this claim of racial discrimination, the judgment of dismissal must be vacated and the\\\\ncase remanded on that claim for such further proceedings as the district court deems proper.  In view of the\\\\nintervening time lapse it may well be desirable that further evidence on this claim be received.  After the further\\\\nproceedings which the trial court finds proper are held, the district judge should then find the facts specially and\\\\nstate separately his conclusions thereon in detail, dealing with the various claims of racial discrimination in\\\\naccordance with Rule 52(a). \\\\nC.\\\\nThe claim of sex discrimination\\\\n1426 Under the Equal Protection Clause, the plaintiffs-appellants argue vigorously *1426 that women inmates in the\\\\nOklahoma prison system are subjected to discrimination in conditions of confinement, job assignments, training\\\\nprograms, mental and medical health services, and recreation.  These were objections made by the plaintiffs to\\\\ndeficiencies in the fact finder\\\\'s final compliance report.  X Jt.App. 58-61.  The specific claims arise from the fact\\\\nthat the State in a stipulation had agreed not to discriminate against inmates on various grounds, including sex,\\\\nand had agreed further to provide equal access to various programs and work assignments.  Brief of Appellants\\\\n22; Brief for the United States as Appellee 30 n. 22. \\\\nThe district court\\\\'s order of dismissal contains the following discussion of this issue:\\\\nThe court finds that equal protection guarantees for women inmates are inadequate in terms of\\\\nprograms, medical care, and exercise.  However, Director Meachum testified there is a $62,000.00\\\\ncurrent special appropriation for women\\\\'s programs and detailed the specific remedies outlined in\\\\nthe Defendants\\\\' Plan.  The court finds the proposed measures will continue constitutionality. \\\\nX Jt.App. 236. \\\\nWith respect to the claim of violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the treatment of women inmates, we feel\\\\nthat the findings are not inadequate.  The trial court specifically found inadequacies in terms of programs, medical\\\\ncare, and exercise.  We feel that the remaining claims of inadequate housing were thus implicitly rejected. \\\\nFurthermore, the trial judge specifically identified the testimony which he credited, that of Director Meachum.  His\\\\ntestimony concerning a $62,000 current special appropriation for women\\\\'s programs was identified.  Moreover,\\\\nthe court concluded that the program laid out by Director Meachum would be constitutionally sufficient.  We note\\\\nthat Director Meachum\\\\'s testimony explained the reason for not having an intermediate health unit for the Mabel\\\\n\\\\nBassett facility in the Oklahoma City area.  He pointed out that they had a psychiatrist assigned to the Mabel\\\\nBassett facility addressing the mental health needs of women.  VII Jt.App. 95-97. \\\\nOn consideration of the evidence relied on by the plaintiffs, the evidence cited by the trial judge, and the resolve\\\\nshown in the testimony of Director Meachum to solve the problem, we cannot say that the findings and\\\\nconclusions of the trial judge on this constitutional claim were in error. \\\\nD.\\\\nThe Eighth Amendment claim\\\\nPlaintiffs further vigorously challenge the findings and conclusions of the district court which rejected their claim\\\\nthat the totality of the circumstances in the Oklahoma prison system amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in\\\\nviolation of the prohibition of the Eighth Amendment.  More specifically, they seriously complain about\\\\novercrowding, food and kitchen facilities, ventilation, educational and training programs, medical and mental\\\\nhealth services, and the occupation temporarily of the East and West Cellhouses at the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary in violation of the May 4, 1979 order of Judge Bohanon. \\\\nIn connection with this constitutional claim and the detailed complaints made, the district court\\\\'s findings and\\\\nconclusions against the plaintiffs were as follows:\\\\n[T]he court finds that management problems exist in the Oklahoma system.  Problem areas can be\\\\ndetermined in food preparation and service, maintenance of equipment and facilities, distribution\\\\nof clothing and essential supplies, and inmate idleness.  These management problems exist\\\\ndespite the extremely professional staff of the Oklahoma prison system.  These problems are\\\\nfound to be primarily a direct result of increases in prison population. \\\\nUnfortunately, there will always be problems and inadequacies.  We are considering a large,\\\\nconfined population of convicted felons, not a nursery school.  As noted by Judge Barrett, \\\"The \\\\n1427 Rhodes majority observed that harsh or restrictive *1427 conditions of confinement are part of the\\\\npunishment criminal offenders justly receive because the Constitution does not mandate\\\\ncomfortable prisons.  Justice Powell wrote that `To the extent that such conditions [of confinement]\\\\nare restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their\\\\noffenses against society.\\\\' 452 U.S. [337] at p. 347 [101 S.Ct. 2392 at p. 2399, 69 L.Ed.2d 59].\\\" Battle v. Anderson, supra at page 1535. \\\\nThe court finds, considering the totality of circumstances, these inadequacies, problems, and\\\\nshortcomings do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the test of Rhodes.  Rhodes v.\\\\nChapman, supra at page 347 [101 S.Ct. at page 2399].  The court finds no evidence at this time to\\\\nshow that the plaintiffs\\\\' present conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system have\\\\nchanged from one of constitutionality to unconstitutionality.  Thus, the court finds that since\\\\nOctober 1982 to the present date the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system\\\\nare constitutional and are not cruel and unusual punishment. \\\\nX Jt.App. 236-37. \\\\nFor reasons we will outline generally, from our review of the record testimony and exhibits, and from the\\\\narguments about the record evidence by plaintiffs, we conclude that the district court\\\\'s findings were not clearly\\\\nerroneous, that the conclusions drawn were supported by the findings and record, and that the determination of\\\\nthe court to dismiss the cause in its entirety, retaining in full force and effect the prior orders and injunctions\\\\nagainst constitutional violations, was not in error. \\\\nWe have noted that there are specific complaints concerning conditions of confinement, including overcrowding,\\\\nfood and kitchen facilities, ventilation, educational and training programs, medical and mental health services,\\\\nand the temporary occupancy of the East and West Cellhouses.  See Brief of Appellants 4-22, 30-36.  However,\\\\n\\\\nthe ban on cruel and unusual punishment prohibits conditions that \\\"involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction\\\\nof pain, [or are] grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment.\\\" Rhodes v.\\\\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 2399, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); see Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312,\\\\n___-___, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 1082-86, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986).  Although prison inmates may not be deprived of the\\\\n\\\"minimal civilized measure of life\\\\'s necessities,.. conditions that cannot be said to be cruel and unusual under\\\\ncontemporary standards are not unconstitutional.  To the extent that such conditions are restrictive and even\\\\nharsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.\\\" Rhodes v.\\\\nChapman, 452 U.S. at 347, 101 S.Ct. at 2399. \\\\nA little over two years ago a panel of this court agreed that the overall conditions of the Oklahoma prison system\\\\nat that time were constitutional.  Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d at 1533, 1537.  We have considered the plaintiffs\\\\'\\\\ncomplaints and the arguments in their briefs concerning the evidence in this subsequent case and are not\\\\nconvinced that the findings of the district court are clearly erroneous.  The State defendants and the intervenor\\\\nUnited States have persuasively argued that the evidence of record does not demonstrate conditions of\\\\nconfinement constituting cruel and unusual punishment under the strict standard of Rhodes v. Chapman.  See\\\\n[4]\\\\nBrief of Defendants-Appellees 2-88; Brief for the United States as Appellee 15-23. \\\\n1428 *1428 We note one item in particular, the complaint that facilities at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary were not air-\\\\nconditioned.  The complaint concerning the heat was covered by the testimony of Mr. Hutto.  The testimony was\\\\nthat the new housing units at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary were air-conditioned.  IV Jt.App. 597.  The East and\\\\nWest Cellhouses were not air-conditioned, but as discussed below, they were vacated, except for limited\\\\nemergency use, in compliance with the orders of Judge Bohanon. \\\\nWith respect to the East and West Cellhouses, the May 4, 1979 order of Judge Bohanon was that the State no\\\\nlonger house inmates at those East and West Cellhouses due to the inadequate facilities there.  In the dismissal\\\\norder of December 30, 1983, the district court noted that the State was not in compliance with that order, but was\\\\nsatisfied from the assurances of Director Meachum and Governor Nigh that the cellhouses would be vacated as\\\\nsoon as feasible.  X Jt.App. 236. \\\\nOn May 25, 1985, plaintiffs filed a motion for a stay pending appeal in this court stating that inmates were being\\\\nhoused in the East and West Cellhouses in violation of the May 4, 1979 order.  The State responded to that\\\\nmotion, representing that the inmates were placed in the cellhouses on May 13, 1985, as the result of a\\\\ndisturbance at another state prison and that the inmates were removed from these East and West Cellhouses on\\\\nMay 28.  Plaintiffs did not challenge these representations. \\\\nThere was a further motion for a stay filed December 27, 1985, in which the plaintiffs again represented that\\\\nsome inmates had been placed into the East and West Cellhouses.  However, this was again related to a riot\\\\nproblem and the defendants informed the plaintiffs\\\\' counsel that the forty-three inmates housed in the East\\\\nCellhouse following the riot were all removed by January 6, 1986.  See Response of the United States to\\\\nAppellants\\\\' Motion to Reconsider Order Denying Stay Pending Appeal 3.  There was no dispute of those facts\\\\nconcerning the removal of the inmates from the East Cellhouse after the problem of temporary occupancy.  We\\\\ntherefore conclude that the complaint concerning the East and West Cellhouses is not supported in our record,\\\\nand we are not persuaded that these temporary emergency uses of the cellhouses should be held a\\\\nconstitutional violation. \\\\nIn sum, we are not persuaded by the arguments of the plaintiffs and the evidence that the findings of the district\\\\ncourt that there was no violation of the Eighth Amendment were clearly erroneous.  In addition, we are not\\\\nconvinced that there was an abuse of discretion by the district court in determining to dismiss the cause as he\\\\n[5]\\\\ndid, retaining in force and effect the prior orders and injunctions against constitutional violations.   The majority\\\\nin Battle v. Anderson, 708 F.2d at 1537, concluded that \\\"a court should exercise supervisory power over the suit\\\\nuntil it can say with assurance not only that eighth amendment violations do not presently exist but there is no\\\\nreasonable expectation that unconstitutional conditions will recur.\\\" In dealing with the various issues before him,\\\\nthe district judge concluded that he was satisfied that the defendants intended permanent compliance with\\\\nconstitutional conditions in the Oklahoma prison system.  X Jt.App. 232, 234-37.  The Memorandum Opinion and\\\\n\\\\n1429 Order *1429 stated that \\\"this court finds that it is now satisfied that there is no reasonable expectation that\\\\nunconstitutional practices will recur in the conditions of confinement in the Oklahoma prison system.\\\" Id. at 238. \\\\nWe are convinced that the district court\\\\'s conclusion was based on findings supported by the record and that the\\\\ndetermination to dismiss in these circumstances was not in error or an abuse of discretion. \\\\nIII\\\\nAs noted, there was a motion for a stay of the district court\\\\'s dismissal order filed on May 25, 1985, by the\\\\nplaintiffs.  This court denied that motion, as noted, stating that we would consider the propriety and scope of the\\\\ndistrict court\\\\'s December 30, 1983 order of dismissal in our disposition of the pending appeal.  On December 27,\\\\n1985, the plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider that order denying the May 25, 1985 motion for a stay.  Because of\\\\nthe disposition we are making in this opinion, we find that motion now to be moot.\\\\nIn addition, on February 4, 1986, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial remand for the district court to make an\\\\nappropriate award of attorney\\\\'s fees pendente lite.  In view of the fact that this court was proceeding to disposition\\\\nof the case, we have deferred a ruling on that motion.  Since we are making a partial remand of the case, the\\\\nplaintiffs will have the opportunity to have the district court consider a further application of attorney\\\\'s fees when\\\\nthose proceedings on remand occur.  The trial judge should entertain any such motion with those proceedings. \\\\nIV\\\\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated we make the following determinations and order as follows:\\\\n1.  The order of dismissal of December 30, 1983, by the district court, which retained in full force and effect the\\\\nprevious orders and injunctions protecting the rights of the plaintiffs against constitutional violations, is\\\\nAFFIRMED except with respect to the claim of racial discrimination discussed in Part II-B of this opinion.  The\\\\nplaintiffs may by further proceedings in the district court seek relief from any violations of those previous orders\\\\nand injunctions protecting their constitutional rights. \\\\n2.', '  The majority\\\\nin Battle v.

Anderson, 376 F.Supp. 402 (E.D.Okla.1974), the\\\\nlitigation concerning constitutional compliance has been ongoing.  See Battle v. Anderson, 447 F.Supp. 516\\\\n(E.D.Okla. ),aff\\\\'d,564 F.2d 388 (10th Cir.1977); Battle v. Anderson, 457 F.Supp. 719 (E.D.Okla.1978),remanded\\\\nfor further hearings,594 F.2d 786 (10th Cir.1979); Battle v. Anderson, 614 F.2d 251 (10th Cir.1980); Battle v.\\\\nAnderson, 708 F.2d 1523 (10th Cir.1983) (per curiam), cert. dismissed,465 U.S. 1014, 104 S.Ct. 1019, 79\\\\nL.Ed.2d 248 (1984); see also Battle v. Anderson, 541 F.Supp. 1061 (E.D.Okla.1982) (award of attorneys\\\\' fees). \\\\n[2] The constitutional right of access to the courts has been found to rest on the guarantees of the Due Process\\\\nClauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  See Ward v. Kort, 762 F.2d 856, 858 (10th Cir.1985). \\\\n[3] In addition to the inventories of materials at the libraries, we note that the handbook \\\"Civil Procedure for\\\\nInmate Legal Research Assistants\\\" itself covered basic principles on federal habeas corpus with chapters on the\\\\nexhaustion doctrine, procedural default, issues cognizable, pleadings, preliminary procedure, and evidentiary\\\\n\\\\nhearings.  Statutory materials and summaries on various cases from the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals\\\\non habeas proceedings were also included. \\\\n[4] The plaintiffs argue that they were denied due process when Chief Judge Seay entered his order of dismissal\\\\nafter having received only four of seven transcripts of the hearing held earlier before Judge Bohanon.  Judge\\\\nSeay had before him at the time of his dismissal the transcripts of the plaintiffs\\\\' entire case in chief, among other\\\\nthings, and the testimony of Governor Nigh and Director Meachum, and the exhibits were apparently available,\\\\nincluding those we have cited earlier concerning access to the courts.  In addition, in his ruling a few months later\\\\non the motion to stay his order, which was denied, the judge stated that he had at that time reviewed the entire\\\\ntranscript of all the proceedings before Judge Bohanon. \\\\n[5] As noted, the district court here expressly stated that \\\"[a]ll of this court\\\\'s orders and injunctions as modified\\\\nheretofore remain in full force and effect.\\\" X Jt.App. 239.  This is in accord with the principle that \\\"[i]t has long\\\\nbeen settled that the court\\\\'s power to grant injunctive relief survives discontinuance of the illegal conduct.  E.g., \\\\nUnited States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1952).\\\" Battle v. Anderson,\\\\n708 F.2d at 1538 n. 4.  If the district court had intended any dissolution of the prior orders, its order \\\"should have\\\\ncontained a definite provision for the dissolution\\\" of those provisions.  Tucker v. Baker, 185 F.2d 863, 865 (5th\\\\nCir.1950).  We are convinced that it is unmistakenbly clear that the orders and injunctions protecting the inmates\\\\nagainst constitutional violations, as previously modified, were in no way intended to be relaxed and that they\\\\nremain in full force and effect. \\\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar. \\\\n\\\\nDocument Title: Opinion\\\\nDocument Content: \\\\n564 F.2d 388 (1977)\\\\nBobby BATTLE, Plaintiff-Appellee,\\\\nv.\\\\nPark J.

The State of Oklahoma, following its filing of its\\\\nNotice of Appeal, moved this court for a stay of the Order of June 14, 1977, which was granted and is yet in force\\\\nand effect.  The appeal and motion for stay were combined for hearing before this court which was held on August\\\\n23, 1977.  The Stay Order has been continued pending disposition of the appeal on the merits. \\\\nThe genesis of the District Court\\\\'s Order of June 14, 1977, is a Motion for Emergency Supplemental Relief filed\\\\nby plaintiff Bobby Battle wherein he alleged \\\"overcrowding\\\" of the inmate population at the state penitentiary.  The\\\\nchallenged Order was entered following full evidentiary hearing.  It contains specific findings, inter alia, relative to\\\\nthe minimum amount of cell space required per prison inmate and, measured thereby, the District Court specially\\\\nfound that as of the May 23 hearing the Oklahoma prison system contained about 4,600 inmates in a system\\\\ndesigned for 2,400, constituting an overcrowding situation of 191 percent.  In addition to the overcrowding crisis,\\\\nthe Court found various and sundry physical and environmental conditions existing throughout the system which\\\\nwere offensive and substandard.  The Court specially found that the overcrowding condition had reached such\\\\nproportions that it constituted a per se unconstitutional condition violative of the Eighth Amendment commands\\\\nprohibiting cruel and unusual punishment.  The Order and Judgment required the State of Oklahoma to achieve\\\\nspecific goals in the reduction of inmate population commencing August, 1977, more fully hereinafter set forth. \\\\nOn appeal, the appellant, State of Oklahoma, alleges error on the part of the District Court in that: (1) the\\\\nevidence does not support a finding that there is a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States\\\\nConstitution, (2) appellants were denied a fair hearing, (3) findings of fact were erroneously made because the\\\\n\\\\ntrial court was misled and unduly swayed by the consideration of inadmissible exhibits and, further, because the\\\\nfacts were for the most part unsubstantiated by competent testimony of the witnesses, and (4) the court should\\\\nhave accepted the State\\\\'s Plan as consented per agreement reached between the State and the appellees. \\\\nThe seriousness of this matter is recognized by all parties concerned.  This court, just as the trial court, is\\\\ncognizant of the strain placed upon the federal-state relationship.  We echo the consistent emphasis of the District\\\\nCourt relating to its reluctance to usurp or interfere with an area historically within the domain and control of the\\\\nsovereign states.  It is in this context that we must judge whether, from the record before us, there exists such a\\\\ncompelling interest in the protection of federal constitutional rights that the Order of the District Court must be\\\\nupheld.  A somewhat detailed recital of the factual-procedural background leading to this opinion should help in\\\\nplacing this difficult case in proper perspective. \\\\nThe initial complaint alleged civil rights deprivations under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 challenging the Oklahoma State\\\\n392 Penitentiary and penal system.  It was filed by Bobby *392 Battle, pro se, on April 24, 1972, when he was a\\\\nprisoner at the penitentiary.  He complained on behalf of himself and other inmates that they were deprived of\\\\nrights secured by the federal constitution and civil rights laws.  The action sought injunctive relief to correct the\\\\nclaimed deprivations and to obtain monetary damages.  The defendants were various Oklahoma officials\\\\nperforming duties relating to the state\\\\'s penal and correctional institutions and system.  Upon motion and hearing,\\\\nthe United States was permitted to intervene on March 5, 1974.  The complaint in intervention filed by the United\\\\nStates alleged that the defendants (the State of Oklahoma, in effect) had discriminated against black inmates in a\\\\nnumber of instances.  The trial of said cause commenced March 14, 1974, and concluded on March 15th.  It had\\\\nbeen preceded by extensive pre-trial discovery including depositions, inspections and investigations conducted\\\\nby attorneys, FBI agents and experts in penology.  The District Court made extensive findings and conclusions\\\\nleading to its Order, generally finding for the plaintiffs.  The Order directed the defendants to undertake certain\\\\nremedial steps, granting them adequate opportunity within which to comply.  Nothing in that proceeding, however,\\\\ninvolved the general contention of prison inmate overcrowding, per se. The Court did deal with conditions existing\\\\nin the \\\"solitary confinement\\\" or \\\"the hole\\\" isolation area of the penitentiary, noting that those confined in such\\\\ndark, unventilated and unsanitary isolation cells were being subjected to intolerable treatment.  The Order also\\\\nreached and disposed of contentions going to racial discrimination and segregation, disciplinary rules,\\\\npunishment and procedure, administrative lockup, use of chemical agents, medical care, correspondence rights,\\\\npublications, access to the courts, and religious freedom.  In apparent reliance on the rule that a \\u00a7 1983 civil rights\\\\naction in Federal District Court is supplemental to any other available remedy, no challenge to the federal court\\\\'s\\\\njurisdiction has at any time been raised or urged on the grounds of exhaustion of available state remedies or as a\\\\nmatter of abstention.  At oral arguments before this court, counsel for the State of Oklahoma did state belief that\\\\nsimilar remedies are available to the inmates under the laws of the State of Oklahoma.  It was acknowledged,\\\\nhowever, that at no time or in anywise was the Federal District Court below moved or requested to invoke\\\\nabstention or exhaustion of available state remedies.  At oral argument, counsel for Bobby Battle, et al.,\\\\ncontended that there are no remedies available under the laws of Oklahoma comparable to the class action\\\\nremedies which may be compelled in a \\u00a7 1983 proceeding.  In any event, it is clear that the parties have acceded\\\\nto the District Court\\\\'s jurisdiction throughout these proceedings. \\\\nThe District Court expressed the reluctance of federal courts to intervene in matters of prison administration, but\\\\nobserved that the United States Supreme Court had held that a policy of judicial restraint on the part of the\\\\nfederal courts in refraining from interference with state penal authorities in their administration of a state\\\\'s penal\\\\nsystem was not a justifiable basis for failure to take cognizance of valid federal constitutional claims relating to\\\\nrights secured to inmates by the federal constitution and the laws of the United States.  Procunier v. Martinez, 417\\\\nU.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263\\\\n(1972); Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969).  The District Court retained\\\\njurisdiction, including that for \\\"determination of all issues not dealt with expressly herein.\\\" The trial court\\\\'s\\\\nmemorandum opinion consumed 30 pages, reported as Battle v. Anderson, 376 F.Supp. 402 (1974). \\\\nWe, too, abhor any situation or circumstance requiring the intervention of the federal courts in matters involving\\\\nthe administration, control and maintenance by the sovereign states of their penal systems.  It is a delicate role\\\\nassigned to the federal courts to display that restraint so necessary \\\"in the maintenance of proper federal-state\\\\n393 relations.\\\" Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963).  We are *393 cognizant of the\\\\n\\\\ncomplexity of problems confronting the states in upgrading not only a host of state institutions and facilities but in\\\\nproperly maintaining them both physically and with adequate personnel.  If we were to close our eyes to the\\\\nfinancial burdens a variety of \\\"piecemeal\\\" federal court orders would impose upon the states and their taxpayers\\\\nwe would refuse to come to grips with reality.  We are in sympathy with the ever increasing budgetary demands\\\\nupon state taxpayers.  There are constitutional and statutory limits on a state\\\\'s capacity to finance capital outlays. \\\\nNo one state governmental body is authorized to dictate a specific course of action.  The governmental wheels\\\\noften turn slowly simply as a result of pressure generated by a multitude of needs.  Those charged with the\\\\nadministration of state government must pick and choose, set priorities and goals, many of which must later be\\\\nabandoned or delayed because of unforeseen emergencies.  Thus, it is in recognition of these problems and\\\\npressures that this court is sincerely reluctant to enter the arena involving the issues presented.  The fact is,\\\\nhowever, that the issues are jurisdictionally before us, just as they were jurisdictionally before the District Court.\\\\nThey have not been invited or solicited.  We are guided by the fact that the United States Supreme Court has not\\\\nwavered in its holding that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibiting the imposition of\\\\ncruel and unusual punishment is, inter alia, intended to protect and safeguard a prison inmate from an\\\\nenvironment where degeneration is probable and self-improvement unlikely because of the conditions existing\\\\nwhich inflict needless suffering, whether physical or mental.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50\\\\nL.Ed.2d 251 (1976); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). \\\\nThe District Court made particular reference to a serious riot which occurred at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary\\\\nin 1973 when it entered its Supplemental Order of June 14, 1977, following Plaintiff\\\\'s Motion for Supplemental\\\\nRelief as to Crowding:\\\\nThe conditions which precipitated and caused the disastrous riot of 1973 at McAlester now prevail\\\\nthroughout the system.  In the hearings conducted by the court in 1974 prior to its May 30, 1974\\\\nOrder (376 F.Supp. 402) the court heard the shocking details of the conditions existing prior to the\\\\nriot and became convinced that the neglect, apathy and deliberate disregard for human decency\\\\nand rights contributed directly to the tragic loss of lives and $20 million in state property damages. \\\\nIt is now equally convinced that the inmate conditions now existing present an immediate and\\\\nintolerable threat to the safety and security of inmates, prison personnel and the people of the\\\\nState of Oklahoma with attendant monetary losses and costs of staggering proportions. \\\\nIn its 1974 opinion in Battle v. Anderson, supra, the District Court noted that during a period of seven months prior\\\\nto the 1973 riot at the penitentiary the inmate population at the main facility averaged about 1778; that two of the\\\\ngeneral population cellhouses were constructed in 1907 and the third and fourth units were added in 1932 and\\\\n1935, providing a design capacity of 1200 inmates. \\\\nIn its Memorandum Opinion of June 14, 1977, from which this appeal was generated, the Trial Court observed\\\\nthat the State of Oklahoma made significant progress in many of the concerned areas included in the original\\\\norder, while failing to do so in other areas; that since the May 30, 1974, order the court had conducted periodic\\\\nhearings at approximately six month intervals; and that evidence concerning the problem of overcrowding and\\\\nconditions of confinement was entertained and presented on May 4, 1976, and October 14-15, 1976, and that\\\\neven though the Court did not issue any orders at those times, \\\"it clearly indicated to the defendants that the then\\\\nexisting population levels and conditions were intolerable and that the court was considering the issuance of an\\\\n394 injunction\\\" and \\\"In the interim the problem kept going.\\\" The court found that as of May 23, *394 1977, the State of\\\\nOklahoma was housing inmates at seven (7) separate facilities totalling 4,600 in facilities with design capacity not\\\\nin excess of 2,400.  Much of this data was obtained from an exhibit constituting a letter from the Director of the\\\\nOklahoma Department of Corrections dated March 22, 1977.  The court observed that it had deferred since May\\\\n30, 1974, from entering specific orders in the hope that the commended vigorous leadership of Warden Crisp and\\\\nDirector Benton would, in effect, move the \\\"powers that be\\\" to correct those abuses, but that the court learned in\\\\nOctober, 1976, that even though the State Board of Corrections in its FY78 Budget had labeled conditions within\\\\nthe Department a \\\"shame and disgrace\\\" to the State of Oklahoma, the crisis was still such that the physical and\\\\nmental health of each inmate was impaired.  The court found that each resident living in a cell should have a\\\\nminimum of 60 square feet of sleeping space and each resident of a dormitory should have 75 square feet, as\\\\nfound by the State Department of Corrections to be the absolute minimum; that certain facilities then in being\\\\nwere woefully inadequate, rendering treatment of inmates there imprisoned cruel and unusual.  The Trial Court\\\\n\\\\nlent considerable credibility to the expert testimony of Theodore James Gordon, an environmental health\\\\nspecialist, Frederick D. Moyer, an architect, and Charles Robert Sarver, a professor of law and sociology and a\\\\nformer correctional administrator.  The court recited in detail the conditions of confinement at each prison facility, i. \\\\ne., the McAlester complex, Granite, Lexington, Quachita, McLeod and Stringtown.  The Court\\\\'s Conclusions of\\\\nLaw and Order and Judgment of June 14, 1977, are as follows:\\\\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\\\\n1.  The Court has the authority and duty to insure that the Constitution does not stop at the prison\\\\ngate, but rather inures to the benefit of all, even to those citizens behind prison walls, Jackson v.\\\\nGodwin, 400 F.2d 529, 532 (5th Cir. 1968),Finney v. Arkansas Board of Education [Correction],\\\\n505 F.2d 194 (8th Cir. 1974). \\\\n2.  In implementing the Constitution, courts have required that certain penal facilities be closed, \\\\nRhem v. Malcolm, 371 F.Supp. 594 (S.D.N.Y. 1974)aff\\\\'d507 F.2d 333 (2nd Cir. 1974),Gates v.\\\\nCollier, 390 F.Supp. 482 (N.D.Miss. 1974), and Hamilton v. Landrieu, 351 F.Supp. 549 (E.D.La.\\\\n1972); that inmates be housed in single cells, instead of multiple inmates in a cell, Inmates of\\\\nSuffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, 360 F.Supp. 676 (D.Mass. 1973)aff\\\\'d,494 F.2d 1196 (1st Cir.\\\\n1974), and Valvano v. Malcolm, 520 F.2d 392 (2nd Cir. 1975) that prison population be limited to a\\\\nfixed number, e. g., Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, 406 F.Supp. 649 (S.D.Tex. 1975); or that\\\\ninmates be afforded a fixed minimum amount square footage (see cases cited at conclusion of law\\\\n6). \\\\n3.  Courts have also evaluated quality of life in penal facilities and demanded a healthy\\\\nenvironment with adequate sanitation, ventilation, lighting and utilities, Williams v. Edwards, 547\\\\nF.2d 120 [1206] (5th Cir. 1977); regarding ventilation Rhem v. Malcolm, supra, Hamilton v. Love,\\\\n328 F.Supp. 1182 (E.D.Ark. 1971) and Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, supra. Vermin\\\\ninfestations, Miller v. Carson, 401 F.Supp. 835, (M.D.Fla. 1975) and Hamilton v. Landrieu, supra.\\\\nSee also Rozechi v. Gaughan, 459 F.2d 6 (1st Cir. 1970) and Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 387\\\\n(M.D.Ala. 1972)aff\\\\'d sub nom. Wyatt v. Aderholt, 523 [503] F.2d 1305 (5th Cir. 1974). \\\\n4.  Courts have grappled with the problems and the conditions of confinement in three ways. \\\\nConditions have been found to be per se unconstitutional.  E. g., Rhem, supra, conditions as\\\\nexacerbated by overpopulation have found to be unconstitutional, E. g., Williams v. Edwards,\\\\nsupra, Finney v. Arkansas Board of Corrections, supra, and Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp. 318\\\\n(M.D.Ala. 1976).  Overcrowding per se has been found to be unconstitutional, Gates v. Collier,\\\\nsupra, McCray v. Sullivan, supra, and Finney v. Arkansas Board of Corrections, supra. This Court\\\\n395 finds that all three of these *395 cases are existent within the Oklahoma Department of\\\\nCorrections. \\\\n5.  In the original Order the Court ordered the closing of certain cells at McAlester.  Likewise, the\\\\nwooden facility at Lexington with its severe environmental and fire hazards shocks the Court\\\\'s\\\\nconscience and must be closed upon completion of the new Lexington A & R unit. \\\\n6.  The crowding in Oklahoma has reached such proportions that this Court could easily find, as\\\\nother courts have, that the crowding is per se unconstitutional.  Certainly where prisoners are\\\\nforced to sleep in garages, barber shops, libraries and stairwells; and where they are placed in\\\\ndormitories without any toilet and shower facilities the crowding has passed the constitutional\\\\nthreshold.  The Court is equally or more offended by the housing of two men within a little 35-40\\\\nsquare foot \\\"cubbyhole\\\".  Such crowding offends the contemporary standards of human decency, \\\\nTrop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, [78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630] (1958). \\\\nThe effects of the crowding as it relates to the conditions of confinement with regard to the health,\\\\nsafety, and security of the inmates is unconstitutional.  The crowding has caused the kitchen, water\\\\nand sewer systems to be overtaxed.  The dining facilities, if they were outside the prison walls\\\\nwould be closed down as immediate health dangers.  Individuals are housed in substandard living\\\\n\\\\nquarters which are firetraps.  However, there is no plan or possibility of putting out the fire if a\\\\nmajor one occurred. \\\\nThere is a direct correlation between overcrowding and violence, see finding of fact 16, supra.\\\\nDefendants acknowledge that the 1973 McAlester riot was caused by the then existing\\\\novercrowded conditions at the O.S.P. This court would be remiss in its duties if it did not move to\\\\nact on the problems, but rather sat idly by until the increasing crowding caused another major\\\\nincident to sweep the Oklahoma Prison system. \\\\n7.  The court adopts the standards of the American Public Health Association for living space and\\\\nenvironmental matters.  APHA calls for 60 square feet in a cell and 75 square feet in a dormitory.  In\\\\nadopting the APHA 60\\\\'/75\\\\' standards respectively, the Court is mindful that most other\\\\norganizations and many of the courts who have faced this problem have adopted higher\\\\nstandards.6\\\\n6 Organizational standards:\\\\n70 sq. feet: National Sheriff\\\\'s Association at 63 (1975)\\\\n70 sq. feet: Building Officials and Code Administrators, Inc., BOCA Basic Building Code, 1975 \\u00a7\\\\n201.3\\\\n70 sq. feet: National Clearinghouse for Criminal Justice Planning and Architecture. \\\\n75 sq. feet: The American Correctional Association Manual of Correctional Standards 49\\\\n80 sq. feet: National Advisory Commission for Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Corrections,\\\\nStandard 11.1, page 353\\\\n90 sq. feet: The International Conference of Building Officials, Uniform Building Code \\u00a7 1307B, p.\\\\n83\\\\nCases:\\\\n60 sq. feet: Pugh v. Locke, supra.\\\\n75 sq. feet: Ambrose v. Malcolm, 414 F.Supp. 485 (S.D.N.Y. (1976). \\\\n88 sq. feet: Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, supra.\\\\n8.  In adopting the APHA environmental standards, the Court points out that a prison facility is a\\\\nclosed ecosystem.  Persons are sent to prison as punishment, not for punishment.  It is incumbent\\\\non the incarcerating body to provide the individual with a healthy habilitative environment. \\\\nAnything less would be to subject the individual to further punishment than was given by the\\\\nsentencing trial court. With habilitation assured, then possibly or probably the inmate can decide\\\\nto rehabilitate himself. \\\\nBut if the basic habilitative needs of the individual are not met then rehabilitation, reformation or\\\\nredemption are not possible.  Water, fire protection, air and food are necessities of life. Minimum\\\\nspace to call one\\\\'s own is a primary psychological necessity.  Without the basic minimums prisons\\\\nare doomed to failure, with both society and the inmates incarcerated therein the losers. \\\\n9.  This Court is well aware of the financial restraints placed on the Defendants and their efforts to\\\\n396 comply with the *396 Constitution.  But the good will shown by the Defendants cannot serve as a\\\\ndefense.  Finney v. Arkansas Board of Correction, supra; Rozechi v. Gaughan, supra; Holt v.\\\\nSarver, 309 F.Supp. 362, 385 (E.D.Ark., 1972); and Davis v. Lindsay, 321 F.Supp. 1134, 1139\\\\n(S.D.N.Y., 1970).  Nor is the lack of financing a defense to a failure to provide minimum\\\\nconstitutional standards.  Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 580 (8th Cir. 1968); Finney v. Arkansas\\\\nBoard of Correction, supra at 199; Gates v. Collier, supra, [501 F.2d 1291,] at 1319, 1320 (5th Cir.\\\\n\\\\n1974); Alberti v. Sheriff of Harris County, supra, at 669; and Hamilton v. Love, supra, at 1194.  If\\\\nthe State of Oklahoma wishes to hold the inmates in institutions, it must provide the funds to\\\\nmaintain the inmates in a constitutionally permissible manner. \\\\n10.  This Court cannot, on the other hand, allow the Defendants to violate the constitutional rights\\\\nof the Plaintiffs\\\\' class and without acting to alleviate the unconstitutional conditions. \\\\nBased upon the foregoing reasons of unconstitutional confinement of inmates, the Court deems it\\\\nnecessary to enter the following order to alleviate the unconstitutional treatment of inmates. \\\\nORDER AND JUDGMENT\\\\nDefendants are directed to achieve the following goals:\\\\n(a) Commencing in August, 1977, defendants shall reduce the inmate population at Oklahoma\\\\nState Penitentiary, McAlester, Oklahoma, at the rate of 100 inmates that month and a like number\\\\neach succeeding month until the population is reduced to 800 inmates. \\\\n(b) Commencing in August, 1977, defendants shall reduce the inmate population at the Oklahoma\\\\nState Reformatory, Granite, Oklahoma, at the rate of 50 inmates that month and a like number\\\\neach succeeding month until the population is reduced to 450 inmates. \\\\n(c) The Court does not require the abandonment or discontinued use of any confinement facility at\\\\nthis time, but within 15 months from the date hereof\\\\nIn accordance with the trial court\\\\'s instructions issued on May 24, 1977, the State of Oklahoma submitted to the\\\\ncourt a proposed plan, as follows:\\\\nDEFENDANTS\\\\' PROPOSED PLAN\\\\nCome now the defendants above named and in accordance with the Court\\\\'s instructions issued\\\\non May 24, 1977, submit the following proposed plan:\\\\nDefendants, admitting no wrongdoing or violation of any inmate\\\\'s constitutional rights, submit a\\\\nsummary of their ongoing plans to the Court to alter the population concentrations existing within\\\\nthe Oklahoma Department of Corrections.  This plan is entered upon with the intent of insuring that\\\\nno inmate is deprived of his constitutional right.  In addition the plan will increase the security within\\\\nthe institutions and to afford the inmates more opportunity for individualized treatment. \\\\n1.  Within a short time, the Department will open a community treatment center in the Oklahoma\\\\nCity area with a capacity of up to 100;\\\\n2.  At the beginning of 1978, the Department will open a 400 person Assessment and Reception\\\\nCenter at Lexington;\\\\n3.  At the beginning of 1978, the Department will establish two additional community treatment\\\\ncenter with a capacity of up to 100 for each center, enabling more than half of the prisoners\\\\nreleased from the system to undergo several months of work release programming;\\\\n4.

It is undenied that the overcrowded conditions\\\\nwhich were the focus of the May, 1977, hearings amount to cruel and unusual punishment.

Given the history of the case\\\\nand the magnitude of the violations this Court believes that it is improbable that any court would\\\\nconclude that it is arbitrary and capricious to grant immediate relief to the victims who are helpless\\\\nand who are now suffering the cruel and unusual punishment which is now being imposed by the\\\\ndefendants by virtue of the unconstitutional conditions. \\\\nIn their Application the defendants further claim irreparable harm because the Order allegedly\\\\nmandates \\\"transfers, paroles, releases, or restrictions by [state] District Judges against\\\\n398 confinement of convicted felons, without due regard for *398 the safety of the general public and\\\\nthe employees and officers of the institutions of the State of Oklahoma and the health and well-\\\\nbeing of the inmates incarcerated therein.\\\" This is an extravagant and unsupported statement. \\\\nThe Court mandated only the reduction in population levels at the two institutions.  It did not\\\\npurport to dictate or mandate the means by which the defendants can accomplish the established\\\\ngoals.  Similarly, defendants allege \\\"the Court has adopted a posture of administering the\\\\nOklahoma Correctional System in abuse of its constitutional authority and jurisdiction.\\\" The Court\\\\nhas only decreed that the overcrowded conditions in the two particular facilities must be eliminated\\\\nwithin a prescribed time period.  The details and administration of a program are left solely to the\\\\ndiscretion of the defendants.  The Court is interested in ends and not means so long as they are\\\\nlawful.  Defendant further contends that the Order \\\"will unduly disrupt the orderly operation of the\\\\npenal institutions of the State of Oklahoma.\\\" This presumes that the prolongation of the\\\\nunconstitutional conditions is essential to the \\\"orderly operation\\\" of the system.  The Court rejects\\\\nthe idea that constitutionality is incompatible with orderliness and that a constitutional operation is\\\\nby definition disorderly.  Defendants also raise the fear that the Order may result in the premature\\\\nrelease of inmates.  This fear should be abandoned.  The Order specifically provides that no inmate\\\\nshall be prematurely released; that the defendant may apply for a release of the timely schedule of\\\\ndepopulation of the two institutions at any time. \\\\nThe Order itself has a built-in safeguard to permit the defendants to avoid any irreparable injury. \\\\nAll that is required of the defendants is that they undertake in August, 1977, and each succeeding\\\\nmonth thereafter, in good faith, and with due diligence, an attempt to comply with the schedule in\\\\nthe Order.  If they do so, \\\"with all the means and resources available to them,\\\" the Court expects\\\\nand demands no more.  If the threat of irreparable injury becomes real rather than speculative, the\\\\ndefendants may apply to the Court for temporary relief and delay.  By its terms the Order does not\\\\ndecree the impossible and does protect the free majority.  If the defendants will avail themselves, if\\\\nnecessary, of this provision of the Order and make the required showing of impossibility or\\\\n\\\"demonstrably dangerous\\\" threat, defendants can avoid any irreparable harm.  Defendants should\\\\nnot object to being required to demonstrate rather than merely imagine the consequences of\\\\nimplementing the schedule. \\\\nThe third burden which defendants have in order to justify a stay is to show that no substantial\\\\nharm will come to the other interested parties if the stay is granted.  North Central Truck Lines,\\\\nInc., v. United States, 384 F.Supp. 1188 (W.D.Mo.1974), aff\\\\'d., 420 U.S. 901 [95 S.Ct. 820, 42\\\\nL.Ed.2d 832.] The defendants largely ignore this requirement.  The evidence of existing\\\\nenvironmental health and safety problems in the system is overwhelming.  There is no doubt that\\\\nthe overcrowding increases the incident of both infectious communicable diseases (e. g., flu,\\\\nhepatitis, tuberculosis, etc.,) and stress related diseases (e. g., rashes, asthma, hypertension,\\\\netc.).  Defendants offer no assurances that in the do-nothing interim requested by them, that\\\\ninmate fatalities or permanent impairment of the physical and mental health of inmates will not\\\\nresult from these causes.  It is a harsh thing to say that the lives and health of inmates must be\\\\nsacrificed to the administrative convenience of the defendants. \\\\n\\\\nFinally, where does the public interest lie?  This is never an easy question to resolve.  It is\\\\nespecially difficult in this type of case, where the plaintiffs\\\\' class are generally a feared and\\\\ndespised class.  Frequently the issue is confused by the political posturing of public officials.  The\\\\nCourt does not purport to be an oracle, able to foresee the future with a clear vision, but it does\\\\n399 know that in July *399 1973 a public disaster occurred at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\\\nMcAlester.  Lives were lost.  It cost the public many millions of dollars of property destroyed by fire\\\\nand the public is still paying a high price for the actions and neglect of defendants\\\\' predecessors. \\\\nFrom the complex of factors involved, the overriding cause must be ascribed to the inhuman and\\\\nunconstitutional conditions which then prevailed.  This is not to justify the riots, but only to state a\\\\nfact.  Similar conditions now exist.  The public interest obviously would be badly served by a repeat\\\\nof that catastrophe.  The risk of a stay is very great.  If, however, the Order is properly executed the\\\\nrisk is greatly reduced.  The Court has not required or ordered the premature release of any\\\\nprisoner.  The defendants must exercise their expertise and good judgment in the matter of\\\\nprisoner release.  The Court has to believe that in the immediate as well as in the long run the\\\\npublic interest in best served by adherence to the Constitution and the protection of the rights of\\\\nall helpless human beings. \\\\nAs evidenced by the foregoing analysis the defendants have failed to make a strong showing that\\\\nsuccess on the merits of the appeal is likely, that unless a stay is granted irreparable harm will\\\\nresult; that no substantial harm will come to the plaintiffs\\\\' class; that granting of the stay will do no\\\\nharm to the public interest.  Therefore the Application for Stay should be denied. \\\\nThereafter, on July 20, 1977, the State of Oklahoma filed with this court a Motion for Stay, invoking the provisions\\\\nof Rule 8 of the Fed.Rules of Appellate Proc., 28 U.S.C.A. That Motion was granted and has been subsequently\\\\nextended and continued to date.  The contentions raised in relation thereto are considered by this court as part\\\\nand parcel of the issues on the merits to be decided on appeal.  In the Motion for Stay the State of Oklahoma\\\\nalleges, inter alia, that (a) the subject order requires the transfer of inmates to less secure institutions within the\\\\nsystem, (b) the State of Oklahoma has previously presented the trial court with a plan for accomplishing the\\\\norderly reduction in inmate population at certain institutions, increasing the capacity at other institutions as well as\\\\npurchasing and constructing new facilities, (c) the aforesaid plan or program has been funded and approved by\\\\nthe Governor and the State Legislature of the State of Oklahoma and mutually agreed to by all of the parties, and\\\\n(d) that if this court fails to stay the Order, the State of Oklahoma must choose between two unacceptable\\\\nactions: first, order inmates transferred to other institutions which have less security, or operating with greater\\\\npopulations than are desirable, place violent and passive inmates in close association, reduce supervision,\\\\nincrease the likelihood of escape and subject the citizens of Oklahoma to increased danger, or, second, to follow\\\\nall the recognized practices of accepted penology, protect the lives and rights of employees, inmates and\\\\ncitizens, but to incur the legal contempt of the court. Finally, the State of Oklahoma points out that the movement\\\\nof inmates necessitates staff transfers, budgetary changes, construction of additional facilities, contracts and\\\\nbidding procedures which must follow state laws, and numerous other administrative problems which require\\\\nseveral months of advanced planning to accomplish, which has, in fact, been considered and incorporated into\\\\nthe State\\\\'s plan for new institutions, as well as the reduction of inmate population at the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary and the Oklahoma State Reformatory.  The State of Oklahoma complains that Battle, et al., and the\\\\nUnited States, as intervenor, presented \\\"absolutely no evidence concerning medical problems, increased\\\\nviolence level, brutality, use of trustee guards, inadequate food and clothing or an excessive amount of time\\\\nspent in cells\\\" while acknowledging that \\\"the testimony concerning these critical areas was solicited on cross-\\\\nexamination from the defendants, Director Benton and Warden Crisp.\\\" [Brief of Defendants-Appellants, p. 10.] 400 Such does not support the contention that the trial court was without *400 substantial evidence to support its\\\\nfindings.  The record indicates otherwise.  Nor are we impressed with the State of Oklahoma\\\\'s contention that the\\\\nTrial Court denied it a fair hearing or that the court was \\\"misled and unduly swayed\\\" by its consideration of\\\\nalleged inadmissible exhibits and unsubstantiated facts.  As to the \\\"fair hearing\\\" contention, the record establishes\\\\nthat even though proper notice was submitted by the court, the State of Oklahoma did not request a pre-trial\\\\nconference or any request of the court to obtain a list of witnesses or other matters.  [R., Vol. I, pp. 8-11.] While\\\\nthe entire record does indeed reflect that certain hearsay and/or questionable exhibits (from an evidentiary point\\\\nof view) were presented, there is nothing indicating that they \\\"misled or unduly swayed\\\" the Trial Court or even\\\\n\\\\nthat the Trial Court in fact relied upon them.  We observe that even though the \\\"foundation\\\" challenges to certain\\\\nexhibits are not without substance, there is no doubt from the record that most of them were in fact documents\\\\nprepared by agencies and/or departments of the State of Oklahoma.  [For example, see Vol. I, pp. 254-265.] We are satisfied that the State of Oklahoma has, since the 1973 disastrous riot, made significant progress in\\\\nupgrading its penal system.  The State contends that the 1974 Oklahoma Legislature appropriated\\\\n$16,285,090.00 to the penal system, representing an increase of 46.9% over the previous year; that the 1976\\\\nLegislature appropriated $44,000,000.00, an increase of 534% over the 1973 appropriation.  There can be no\\\\ndoubt that the State of Oklahoma has, as the District Court acknowledged, made significant strides and efforts to\\\\nremedy the serious deficiencies.  Even so, the Court\\\\'s finding that the presently existing overcrowding condition at\\\\nthe two facilities, when considered with other circumstances, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is not\\\\nclearly erroneous.  We hold that there is substantial evidence supporting the finding.  It was made, to be sure,\\\\nnotwithstanding the comprehensive Plan prepared and submitted to the Court by the State of Oklahoma and\\\\napproved by all parties to this litigation.  That Plan established a priority goal by the State in the commitment of its\\\\nfiscal and administrative resources to expeditiously upgrade its entire penal-correctional system.  We commend\\\\nthe State of Oklahoma and its people for the actions taken.  Even so, we must hold that the Trial Court did not err\\\\nin its order here challenged.  We cannot, on the basis of the record before us, arbitrarily substitute our judgment\\\\nfor that of the resident federal district judge who has given so much of his time, conscience and effort to this on-\\\\ngoing case. His concern for the protection of the constitutional rights of the inmates goes to the \\\"heart\\\" of their\\\\nphysical and mental well being.  We believe that the Trial Court has endeavored to diligently accommodate the\\\\nconcurrent problems confronting the State of Oklahoma.  We agree with the District Court that the exigencies\\\\nweigh in favor of the inmates. \\\\nWe have carefully considered the State of Oklahoma\\\\'s request for the additional time required to effectuate its\\\\ncomprehensive Plan which the State deems necessary in order to fashion a solid basis for future planning and\\\\nadministration of the state\\\\'s penal system.  In relation to the Stay Order, the State of Oklahoma alleges that the\\\\nTrial Court has mandated an arbitrary reduction of the inmate population with fixed schedules in the face of a\\\\nreasonable and feasible State plan already adopted and designed to remove the conditions complained of which\\\\nhas met with the consent of all of the parties.  The State of Oklahoma does not challenge or dispute the fact of\\\\novercrowding at the two penal facilities affected by the reduction order, but it does emphatically argue that those\\\\nconditions are not such as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by the Eighth Amendment. \\\\nDuring oral argument, counsel for the State of Oklahoma emphasized that the record simply does not support the\\\\nTrial Court\\\\'s findings that the inmates at the two affected facilities are being subjected to cruel and unusual\\\\npunishment.  On the contrary, it was contended that they are not in anywise ill treated. \\\\n401 *401 Bobby Battle, et al. (the inmate class), by and through the American Civil Liberties Union, have resisted the\\\\nMotion for Stay, pointing to the uncontroverted facts of overcrowding and the intolerable conditions of\\\\nconfinement found by the Trial Court to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Battle contends that the facts\\\\nfound are not denied by the State of Oklahoma and that the \\\"defendants totally ignore the danger which these\\\\npractices [overcrowding in cells, inadequate ventilation, fire protection and sanitation] place the inmate population\\\\nin.\\\" Battle argues that the Trial Court\\\\'s order was issued after careful, deliberate proceedings and consideration,\\\\non the basis of overwhelming evidence of unconstitutional prison conditions.  Further, Battle alleges that the State\\\\nof Oklahoma is not entitled to a stay simply because it must go to some extra effort in order to comply.  Battle\\\\nargues that the State fails on each of the four factors this Court must consider in granting the requested stay: (1)\\\\nwhether the State has made a strong showing that it is likely to prevail on the merits of the appeal, (2) whether\\\\nthe State has shown irreparable injury if the stay is not granted, (3) whether a stay will substantially harm the\\\\nother parties to the litigation, and (4) where the public interest lies.  Battle contends that the State of Oklahoma\\\\nhas virtually ignored these requirements. \\\\nThe United States of America, as Plaintiff Intervenor, by and through the Attorney General, Department of Justice,\\\\nhas moved to deny State\\\\'s Motion for Stay, alleging, inter alia, that the State of Oklahoma has not specifically\\\\naddressed itself to the four (4) elements of the criteria above referred to in determining the propriety of a stay\\\\norder pending compliance with the Plan.  Furthermore, the United States argues that even had the State done so,\\\\nit could not have prevailed in the face of the continuation of physical conditions and practices at the two\\\\ninstitutions which the District Court found to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in relation to the inmate\\\\n\\\\npopulation.  The United States urges that the stay be denied in that the continuation of the intolerable conditions\\\\nwill require inmates to suffer substantial harm by being forced to live in less than 20 square feet and to be housed\\\\nin facilities which are unfit for human habitation.  Further, the United States argues that the State\\\\'s Plan,\\\\nconsented to by the parties, was not submitted at or during any of the three hearings dealing with the issue of\\\\novercrowding and that, in fact, the Plan was not written until after the trial court\\\\'s May 24, 1977, bench ruling and\\\\nwas not presented to the parties until June 13, 1977.  The record confirms this contention.  The United States also\\\\nalleges that the inmate reduction order was orally communicated by the Court on May 24, 1977 and that the\\\\nparties were directed to confer upon the timetable, knowing that the Court was considering a range of 90 to 180\\\\ndays.  Again, the record bears this out.  [R., Vol. I, p. 282.] However, the United States does agree that the parties\\\\ndid present to the Court a draft order which contained the Plan\\\\'s recommended construction timetable, but which\\\\ndid not deal with either the numerical or time limitations ordered by the Trial Court from the bench.  Accordingly,\\\\nthe United States contends that the Trial Court\\\\'s order requiring a reduction of inmate population on a timetable\\\\nbasis is clearly within the equitable power of the Court and a matter directly addressed by the Court at the\\\\nconclusion of the May 24, 1977 hearing. \\\\nDISPOSITION\\\\nWe hold that the challenged Order of the District Court is supported by substantial evidence.  We direct that the\\\\nStay Order Pending Appeal entered by this Court as thereafter extended and continued, be and the same is\\\\nhereby vacated. \\\\nWe hold that the Trial Court\\\\'s finding that the overcrowding inmate population at the two subject Oklahoma\\\\ninstitutions constitutes cruel and unusual punishment proscribed under the Eighth Amendment to the United\\\\nStates Constitution, is supported by substantial evidence.  See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50\\\\n402 L.Ed.2d 251,supra.  In that case the Court held that a state prisoner\\\\'s civil rights complaint *402 lodged under 42\\\\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment for inadequate treatment of a back\\\\ninjury while engaged in work in the Texas penitentiary must be entertained, and that deliberate indifference by\\\\nprison personnel to a prisoner\\\\'s serious injury or illness constitutes cruel and unusual punishment contravening\\\\nthe Eighth Amendment.  The court there reviewed the history of the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual\\\\npunishment.  It noted that the primary concern of the constitutional drafters was to proscribe \\\"tortures\\\" and other\\\\n\\\"barbarous\\\" methods of punishment.  The court then related:\\\\nOur more recent cases, however, have held that the Amendment proscribes more than physically\\\\nbarbarous punishments.  See, e. g., Gregg v. Georgia, supra [428 U.S. 153] at 171, [96 S.Ct. 2909\\\\nat 2924] (plurality opinion); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-101, [78 S.Ct. 590, 597, 598, 2\\\\nL.Ed.2d 630] (1958); Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 373 [30 S.Ct. 544, 551, 54 L.Ed.\\\\n793] (1910).

Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 579 (C.A. 8 1968),\\\\nagainst which we must evaluate penal measures.  Thus, we have held repugnant to the Eighth\\\\nAmendment punishments which are incompatible with \\\"the evolving standards of decency that\\\\nmark the progress of a maturing society.\\\" Trop v. Dulles, supra, [356 U.S.] at 101, [78 S.Ct. 590 at\\\\n598]; see also Gregg v. Georgia, supra, [428 U.S. 153] at 153, [96 S.Ct. 2909] (plurality opinion); \\\\nWeems v.

Utah, supra, [996 U.S. 130] at 136, [25\\\\nL.Ed. 345]. \\\\nThese elementary principles establish the government\\\\'s obligation to provide medical care for\\\\nthose whom it is punishing by incarceration.  An inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his\\\\nmedical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met. In the worst cases, such\\\\na failure may actually produce physical \\\"torture or a lingering death,\\\" In re Kemmler [136 U.S. 436,\\\\n10 S.Ct. 930, 34 L.Ed. 519,] supra, the evils of most immediate concern to the drafters of the\\\\nAmendment.  In less serious cases, denial of medical care may result in pain and suffering which\\\\n\\\\nno one suggests would serve any penological purpose.  Cf. Gregg v. Georgia, supra, [428 U.S.\\\\n153] at 171-74, [96 S.Ct. 2909 at 2924-25] (plurality opinion).  The infliction of such unnecessary\\\\nsuffering is inconsistent with contemporary standards of decency as manifested in modern\\\\nlegislation codifying the commonlaw view that \\\"[i]t is but just that the public be required to care for\\\\nthe prisoner, who cannot, by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, care for himself.\\\" In Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) the Supreme Court stated, inter alia:\\\\nOf course, the requirements of the Eighth Amendment must be applied with an awareness of the\\\\nlimited role to be played by the courts.  This does not mean that judges have no role to play, for the\\\\nEighth Amendment is a restraint upon the exercise of legislative power. \\\\n\\\"Judicial review, by definition, often involves a conflict between judicial and legislative judgment as\\\\nto what the Constitution means or requires.  In this respect, Eighth Amendment cases come to us\\\\nin no different posture.  It seems conceded by all that the Amendment imposes some obligation on\\\\nthe judiciary to judge the constitutionality of punishment and that there are punishments that the\\\\nAmendment would bar whether legislatively approved or not.\\\" Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. [238]\\\\nat 313-314, [92 S.Ct. 2706, 2825, 33 L.Ed.2d 346] (White, J. concurring.) 428 U.S. at p. 174, 96 S.Ct., at p. 2925. \\\\n403 *403 It is the obligation of the federal courts to be ever alert not to intrude into the affairs of state prison\\\\nadministration unless there is displayed a clear failure by the State to take cognizance of an inmate\\\\'s valid federal\\\\nconstitutional rights.  We are satisfied that in the instant case neither this court nor the District Court has interfered\\\\nwith matters in the sole discretion of state officials.  We believe that while an inmate does not have a federal\\\\nconstitutional right to rehabilitation, he is entitled to be confined in an environment which does not result in his\\\\ndegeneration or which threatens his mental and physical well being. \\\\nThe State of Oklahoma argues that if this Court affirms the Trial Court\\\\'s order and if the inmates are transferred to\\\\nother institutions \\\"which have less security, or operating with greater populations than are desirable\\\" that such\\\\naction will place violent and passive inmates in close association, reduce supervision, increase the likelihood of\\\\nescape and subject the people of Oklahoma to increased danger.  We would wish such risks away if wishing\\\\nserved the purpose.  We agree with the Trial Court finding, that while the State of Oklahoma has made significant\\\\nprogress in correcting many of the abuses and/or providing for new or additional facilities, personnel and\\\\nprograms within its penal system, still the State has not prevented the degenerated overcrowding conditions\\\\nwhich have come to pass at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester and at the Oklahoma State\\\\nReformatory at Granite.  The transfer of the inmates as ordered by the Trial Court is, of course, subject to change\\\\nor modification if the District Court deems such action necessary and proper in the future.  Viewing the facts and\\\\ncircumstances contained in the record in their totality, we hold that the Order here challenged must be affirmed. \\\\nWhile neither this Court nor the District Court holds to the proposition that prisoners subjected to the punishment\\\\nof incarceration are entitled to the rights and privileges of one who has not committed a crime against person or\\\\nproperty crying out for retribution, still the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment cannot be countenanced in\\\\nan orderly society.  While the rights and privileges necessarily lost 00 and, in effect, surrendered 00 by prisoners in\\\\n97 97\\\\npunishment for crimes committed are many and varied, they cannot be denied all rights and privileges.

The\\\\ncomplaint seeks injunctive relief, on behalf of all members of the plaintiff class, to remedy the alleged misconduct\\\\nof the defendants as well as monetary damages for plaintiff Battle. \\\\nNamed as defendants were Leo McCracken, Director of Corrections, Park J. Anderson, Warden, and Sam C.\\\\nJohnston, Deputy Warden of the State Penitentiary at McAlester.  Since the commencement of this action, Leo\\\\nMcCracken has been replaced by John Grider, who now serves as Acting Director of Corrections, and Park J.\\\\nAnderson has been replaced by Sam C. Johnston, who now serves as Acting Warden of the State Penitentiary at\\\\nMcAlester, and Mr. Pete Douglas has replaced Sam C. Johnston as Acting Deputy Warden.  Mr. Roy Sprinkle,\\\\nDeputy Director of Corrections in charge of Institutions, Captain Black, Danny Nace and Otis Campbell,\\\\nCorrectional Officers at the State Penitentiary, have been added as defendants. \\\\nOn March 15, 1973, the late Judge Edwin Langley granted the United States\\\\' Motion to Intervene pursuant to\\\\nTitle IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000h-2.  The complaint in intervention alleged segregation by\\\\nrace in housing assignments and certain other aspects of penitentiary operations. \\\\n\\\\nOn March 5, 1974, the Court granted the United States\\\\' motion to amend its complaint in intervention which now\\\\nalleges, in addition to the allegations of the original complaint in intervention, that the defendants have\\\\ndiscriminated against black inmates in making job assignments and in the operation of the penitentiary\\\\ndisciplinary system; and that they have, with regard to all inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, without\\\\nregard to race, subjected them to disciplinary procedures and taken disciplinary action against them without\\\\nproviding due process of law; subjected those inmates in disciplinary segregation to cruel and unusual\\\\n408 punishment by depriving them of food, clothing, bedding, light and necessary *408 personal hygiene items;\\\\nplaced inmates in non-disciplinary administrative segregation without providing them with due process of law and\\\\nsubjected them to unreasonable conditions of confinement; inflicted upon inmates summary punishment without\\\\ndue process of law and cruel and unusual punishment by the use of chemical agents, including mace and tear\\\\ngas; inflicted upon inmates cruel and unusual punishment by maintaining and operating a medical care delivery\\\\nsystem that is incapable of providing and has failed to provide adequate medical care; imposed upon inmates\\\\narbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on mailing privileges, including censorship and rejection of mail to and\\\\nfrom attorneys, courts, government officials, family members and religious ministers; refused inmates the right to\\\\nsubscribe to or receive personal legal reference materials, as well as certain other periodicals; and denied\\\\ninmates adequate access to the courts by failing to provide an adequate law library or any reasonable and\\\\nadequate alternative thereto and by specifically refusing to permit inmates to have in their possession any\\\\npersonal legal reference materials or to assist each other on legal problems. \\\\nThe parties have conducted extensive pretrial discovery consisting of depositions, inspections and investigations\\\\nconducted by attorneys, FBI agents and experts in penology. \\\\nAt the final pretrial conference held on March 4, 1974, counsel orally stipulated and agreed and the court ordered\\\\nthat all depositions taken prior to trial be admitted into evidence and made a part of the record. \\\\nTrial on the merits was heard at McAlester, Oklahoma, on March 14 and 15, 1974.  At the outset, counsel for all\\\\nparties stipulated and agreed to the authenticity of copies of documents marked exhibits 1 through 161 and\\\\ncontained in 18 bound volumes previously tendered to counsel and the court by the United States.  It was further\\\\nstipulated and agreed and the court ordered that the said exhibits be admitted into evidence and made a part of\\\\nthe record in this case.\\\\nUpon the basis of the depositions and exhibits and the oral testimony heard at the trial of this case and the cases\\\\nof Holland et al. v. Anderson (No. 73-324) heard on March 12, 1974, and the consolidated cases of Barnett et al.\\\\nv. Hall (No. 73-237), Johnson v. Anderson (No. 74-8), Barnett et al. v. Pontesso (No. 70-97) and Johnson et al. v.\\\\nAnderson (No. 72-90) heard on March 13, 1974, the court makes its findings of fact and conclusions of law as\\\\nfollows:\\\\nFindings of Fact\\\\n1.  The Oklahoma State Penitentiary system consists of a main maximum security facility at McAlester and\\\\nseveral subsidiary institutions located at McAlester and other locations throughout the southeastern and western\\\\nportion of Oklahoma.  These subsidiaries include a dual unit women\\\\'s ward and a male trusty unit which are also\\\\nlocated at McAlester; a medium security vocational training school located at Stringtown, Oklahoma, about 40\\\\nmiles south of McAlester; a smaller minimum security facility for vocational training located near Hodgens,\\\\nOklahoma; and an Honor farm near Farris, Oklahoma. \\\\n2.

Title\\\\n57 O.S.A. \\u00a7 521. \\\\n5.  Between January, 1970 and July 27, 1973, the total population in the penitentiary system averaged about\\\\n2,990 male and 120 female inmates.  The largest concentration of inmates in the system was \\\"behind the walls\\\" at\\\\nthe main facility at McAlester. \\\\n6.  On July 27, 1973, a riot occurred at the McAlester facility which resulted in the destruction of some physical\\\\nfacilities and damage to others.  Following the riot, many programs, procedures, practices and operations that had\\\\nbeen in effect at the penitentiary were either eliminated or curtailed.  The general inmate population was placed\\\\non a twenty-four-hour lockdown which continued with only minor modifications at the time of the trial in this case.\\\\nNumerous examples could be cited from the record of practices and conditions which were justified as\\\\nemergency measures in the immediate aftermath of the riot and even for some time thereafter, but which were\\\\nstill in substantial effect at the time of the trial of this case, long after their justification had ended. \\\\n7.  During the 7 months of 1973 prior to the riot, the inmate population at the main facility averaged about 1778 or\\\\n57% of the total penitentiary population.  The racial composition of the population at the main facility averaged\\\\n29.5% Black and 70.5% non-Black inmates.  Many of these inmates were transferred to subsidiary institutions and\\\\nto municipal and county holding facilities and commitments to McAlester were suspended following the riot.  The\\\\npopulation at McAlester dropped to 1338 in August 1973, and after several additional reductions has leveled off\\\\nat approximately 900 inmates since the first of this year. \\\\n8.  Prior to the riot, the facilities at the main penitentiary consisted of an administration building, four general\\\\npopulation cellhouses and a mess hall radiating from a central rotunda, a maximum security unit and combination\\\\nhospital-gymnasium and a series of industrial and maintenance buildings, some of which were located in the\\\\n\\\"industrial area\\\" north of the main walls.  Two of the general population cellhouses were constructed in 1907.  The\\\\nthird and fourth units were added in 1932 and 1935.  The design capacity of the penitentiary was approximately\\\\n1,200. \\\\n9.  The civilian staff level of about 350 at the main McAlester facility has remained fairly constant.  Out of this total\\\\ncivilian staff, about 242 have been employed as security personnel holding the rank of Correctional Officer I\\\\n410 (about 160 men); Correctional Officer *410 II (about 65 men); Correctional Officer III or Lieutenant (about 11\\\\nmen); and Correctional Officer IV or Captain (about 6 men).  Under the normal conditions as they existed before\\\\nthe riot, the security staff provided 24 hour, 7 day a week supervision and surveillance over the cellhouses,\\\\nlockup areas, guard towers and hospital complex.  The staff also provided daytime supervision and surveillance\\\\nover the work areas (industrial, maintenance and administrative), the yard and special inmate work gangs.  They\\\\nalso supplied the supervision required for the transfer of inmates to other Oklahoma penal facilities, to outside\\\\nmedical facilities and to the courts.  Their post-riot activities have generally consisted of carrying out such security\\\\nfunctions as were deemed necessary, from time to time, by penitentiary authorities. \\\\n\\\\n10.  The security force at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester is understaffed and spread far too thin. \\\\nThe continuing deficiencies in needed personnel have been at least 30 to 35 percent less than the level required\\\\nto maintain adequate supervision and control.  This limited staff is inadequately trained and poorly supervised. \\\\nThere is a high turnover among correctional officers; the monthly rate reaching 8 to 9 percent, particularly among\\\\nlower echelon security personnel.  Proper training may well be impossible with this shortage of personnel\\\\naccompanied by such a continuing turnover rate. \\\\nThe available security force is simply inadequate to maintain proper order and carry on even minimally effective\\\\ncorrections operations.  Staffing deficiencies have been a causative factor in the conditions which existed and still\\\\nexist at the penitentiary.  The level of violence inside the penitentiary has been alarming.  From January 1970 until\\\\nJuly 27, 1973, defendants\\\\' own records reflect a total of 19 violent deaths.  In addition, there were 40 stabbings\\\\nand 44 serious beatings of inmates.  Some of the violence occurred in the cellhouses where frequently only one\\\\nguard was available for an entire cellhouse.  Some violence occurred on the prison yard where frequently only\\\\none or two guards were available to supervise and control the entire general population. \\\\n11.  Since the riot, lack of adequate security has been used continously as an excuse for the confinement of the\\\\nmajority of inmates in their cells 24 hours a day, in complete idleness and without any form of exercise or other\\\\nrecreation.  As previously indicated, this massive and almost total lockdown has continued for over 8 months, with\\\\nthe limited exception that inmates not confined in disciplinary maximum security have recently been granted the\\\\nmeager privilege of eating one or two meals in the mess hall every other day provided adequate security is\\\\navailable.  Only a limited number of inmates are regularly permitted out of their cells to perform penitentiary\\\\nmaintenance and housekeeping chores such as preparing food and repairing or maintaining the physical\\\\ncomplex. \\\\nRacial Discrimination and Segregation\\\\n12.  Prior to the July riot, the policy and practice at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary was to maintain a prison\\\\nsystem segregated by race and by means of which black inmates were subjected to discriminatory and unequal\\\\ntreatment.  Except for the maximum security unit, where inmates under disciplinary punishment were confined in\\\\nsingle cells, all inmates were routinely assigned to housing units on the basis of race.  The reception center, the\\\\nmess hall, the recreation yard and barber facilities were racially segregated.  Black inmates were discriminated\\\\nagainst in job assignments and were subjected to more frequent and disparate punishment than white inmates. \\\\nThe guard force was and remains predominantly white.  A policy statement issued by the Department of\\\\nCorrections on October 20, 1972, declared the official departmental policy to be that all of its correctional facilities\\\\nwould be integrated in order to insure equal rights and equal opportunity to all persons confined therein.  This\\\\n411 policy *411 statement also directed correctional administrators to formulate, implement and follow up procedures\\\\nto insure that discrimination did not occur in practice.  The need to increase minority personnel at every level was\\\\nmade clear and it was suggested that each correctional facility appoint an official to be directly responsible for\\\\nsupervising the recruitment and fair treatment of minority employees.  A departmental operations memorandum\\\\nissued on the same date set forth specific requirements for the implementation of the departmental policy\\\\nstatement.  Wardens at each state penal facility were directed to prepare plans for complete integration, to take\\\\nimmediate action to inform and instruct all employees regarding the official policy on racial segregation and of\\\\ntheir obligations thereunder, to implement an objective and fair classification system for inmates with respect to\\\\nall aspects of institutional life, to inform the inmates of the racial segregation policy, and to make telephonic\\\\nprogress reports each Monday morning to the Deputy Director of Institutions or the Director of the Department of\\\\nCorrections detailing the percentages of integration at each location and any major problems encountered.  Both\\\\nthe policy statement and accompanying operations memorandum were completely ignored by the Warden at the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester.  Racial segregation, as had been practiced prior to the issuance of\\\\nthese directives, continued unabated.  Not until the July riot did any noticeable changes occur.  Only at that time,\\\\noperating under emergency conditions, were inmates randomly lined up and ordered into cells.  At the present\\\\ntime the housing units are not racially segregated.  Due to perceived emergency conditions the prison population\\\\nis temporarily confined to single cells under 24 hour lockdown.  The defendants have instituted a security\\\\nclassification system under which inmates are assigned either a medium, maximum, or close custody grade and\\\\n\\\\nseparated into various housing units according to their respective classifications.  The new grading system does\\\\nnot, however, provide for specific cell assignments and transfers on a non-racial basis.  Accordingly, there is no\\\\npresent assurance that housing units will not become resegregated when normal operations are restored. \\\\nDisciplinary Rules, Punishment and Procedure\\\\n13.  Prior to the July 27, 1973, riot, defendants administered a disciplinary program which could result in punitive\\\\nsanctions including punitive segregation as well as loss of incentive time and other privileges.  These sanctions\\\\nwere imposed pursuant to a disciplinary process which is described in departmental policy statements and in the\\\\nmost recent inmate manual.  Viewing the disciplinary process as a whole, to include both policies and practices,\\\\ndefendants have failed to afford inmates the procedural safeguards which are minimally necessary to insure\\\\nfundamental fairness.  The record discloses the following:\\\\n(a) Inmates are not fairly adequately apprised of the conduct which can lead to disciplinary action. \\\\nSome, but not all, punishable conduct is contained in various rule books and manuals.  There is,\\\\nhowever, no policy limiting punishment to listed infractions; some infractions are specified in\\\\nemployee manuals, but excluded from inmate rule books; some of the most common, minor\\\\ninfractions are nowhere listed or defined although punishment routinely results in the event of\\\\nviolations.  In some instances, inmates have been punished for violating unwritten rules against\\\\nconstitutionally protected activity (e. g., assisting or being assisted by one another in legal matters\\\\nin the absence of reasonable alternatives). \\\\n(b) In the event that disciplinary charges are filed, the applicable Department of Corrections policy\\\\nstatement provides for pre-hearing detention in \\\"serious cases\\\" only.  It was formerly the official\\\\n412 O.S.P. practice *412 to segregate only those charged with \\\"major\\\" offenses, as described in the\\\\nemployee manual.  This practice was later changed by O.S.P. officials, and, thereafter, all inmates\\\\ncharged with any rule infraction(s) were automatically confined in segregation, prior to a hearing,\\\\nin the punishment work gang lockup area located in New Cellhouse or the new jail in the West\\\\nCellhouse.  Because the Disciplinary Committee usually met only once a week, inmates could\\\\nroutinely be held in segregation for up to six days without a hearing, regardless of the seriousness\\\\nof the offense charged.  Inmates have in fact been so held for up to six weeks before receiving\\\\ntheir hearings. \\\\n(c) The Department of Corrections has published rules governing the procedures to be followed at\\\\ndisciplinary hearings.  They do not require, however, that the disciplinary committee be comprised\\\\nof disinterested persons.  In practice, hearings have been and are held on occasion before\\\\ncommittees with a member or members who have either brought the charges against the inmate\\\\nor otherwise participated in the preparation or processing thereof. \\\\n(d) The official policy is to afford inmates a prehearing interview and an opportunity to appear and\\\\nbe heard at the hearing itself.  Inmates are, however, denied the right to call witnesses on their\\\\nown behalf or to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.  No representation is provided by\\\\nthe institution and outside assistance from counsel or any other source is prohibited. \\\\n(e) There are no departmental rules, criteria or standards governing the type or duration of\\\\npunishment which the disciplinary committee may impose for any given infraction.  It has been the\\\\npolicy and practice at the penitentiary to impose indefinite sentences to the various lockup\\\\nfacilities.  As a result of this practice, inmates have in fact often been held on punitive segregation\\\\nfor prolonged terms (which frequently reached six months to a year) under extremely harsh\\\\nrestraints and conditions. \\\\n(f) It is the written policy of the Department of Corrections to afford a weekly review of all persons\\\\non lockup by the Deputy Warden or his designee.  The Standard to be applied and the procedures\\\\nto be followed during these review sessions are not, however, set forth.  In practice, there is no\\\\nmeaningful independent review by the Deputy Warden or other high-ranking, responsible\\\\n\\\\nadministrative officer or panel.  Instead, the responsibility for determining length of confinement\\\\nhas been abdicated to the correctional officers in charge of the individual lockups. \\\\n(g) The officer in charge of the Maximum Security Unit has been permitted to punish inmates\\\\nsummarily, without a hearing or any other procedural safeguards for conduct which takes place in\\\\nthe unit.  Accordingly, inmates have had the minimal privileges afforded on M.S.U.  further reduced\\\\nfor conduct deemed objectionable by the officers in charge.  Similarly, inmates may be transferred\\\\nto one of several isolation cells on M.S. U. at the sole discretion of the officer in charge, without\\\\nany procedural safeguards other than the informal requirement that the Deputy Warden or chief of\\\\nSecurity be notified. \\\\n14.  Inmates confined in disciplinary lockup, particularly in the Maximum Security Unit, have been held for\\\\nprolonged periods in close confinement.  Exercise was limited to 15 minutes twice a week prior to the riot.  Since\\\\nthat time all exercise was being denied as recently as the date of this trial. Sleeping accommodations consist of\\\\nmattresses placed directly on the floor or on a concrete slab.  There were and are no beds.  The cells are vermin\\\\ninfested.  Lighting throughout the lockup areas was and is inadequate. \\\\n413 The isolation cells have the same dimensions and fixtures as other M.S.U.  *413 cells.  They are, however, sealed\\\\noff from the rest of the unit by a dividing wall. These isolation cells have only a small window or \\\"bean hole\\\" which\\\\ncan be closed to isolate the occupant completely and to seal out all light and ventilation.  Such inmates receive no\\\\nexercise, reading material or any other form of recreation. \\\\nInmates who were sentenced to that form of disciplinary status officially referred to as \\\"72 hour detention,\\\" were\\\\ndeprived of food, clothing, bedding and necessary hygienic materials and confined in cells generally known and\\\\ncommonly referred to as \\\"hole\\\" cells.  These are totally dark and stripped of all fixtures other than latrines and\\\\nfaucets.  Penitentiary officials published rules for such \\\"72 hour detention,\\\" but there were no published\\\\ndepartmental policies governing the use of these \\\"hole\\\" cells.  Confinement in these \\\"hole\\\" cells was discontinued\\\\nin the fall of 1972, pursuant to an unwritten administrative directive.  The actual cells have been maintained and\\\\nremain available in substantially the same condition as before for future use at any time this or any subsequent\\\\nadministration so decides. \\\\nAdministrative Lockup\\\\n15.  Prior to the riot, a large number of inmates were confined in administrative segregation on the top floor of the\\\\nwest cell house and on the top floor of the new cell house.  Although some inmates were held in the administrative\\\\nsegregation areas for disciplinary punishment due to a lack of space in the maximum security unit, the majority\\\\nwere so held for a variety of reasons such as protection from other inmates, observation, investigation, awaiting\\\\ncourt action and pre-hearing detention.  These inmates had been convicted of no infractions or offenses and had\\\\nbeen provided no hearings or other procedural safeguards.  In spite of this, they were subjected to conditions of\\\\nconfinement which were punitive in nature.  They were held in close confinement for prolonged periods with\\\\nminimal lighting and ventilation.  They received no exercise.  Their privileges were restricted and they were denied\\\\nthe oportunity to participate in the prison work programs, to earn work time or to engage in any self-improvement\\\\nprograms.  They were not considered for trusty status or parole eligibility.  Following the riot, administrative\\\\nsegregation as previously practiced was dispensed with.  Instead, through the process of custody grading and the\\\\n24 hour lockdown, essentially the entire prison population is now confined in administrative segregation under\\\\nconditions which can still only be described as punitive.  Inmates classified as \\\"maximum custody,\\\" are not\\\\nconfined in the maximum security unit, and the first floor of East Cellhouse although they have been provided no\\\\ndisciplinary hearings.  Inmates classified as \\\"close custody\\\" are now confined on the second and third floors of\\\\nEast Cellhouse.  Inmates classified \\\"medium custody\\\" are confined on the fourth floor of East Cellhouse and\\\\nthroughout the West Cellhouse.  A limited number of medium security inmates who have work assignments are\\\\nalso housed on the first floor of New Cellhouse.  Inmates with different custody grades received different\\\\ntreatment.  Those maximum custody inmates assigned to the maximum security unit receive the fewest privileges. \\\\nAt the other extreme are the medium custody inmates who have been afforded work privileges. \\\\n\\\\nUse of Chemical Agents\\\\n16.  The use of chemical mace and tear gas normally causes physical pain and discomfort and, on several\\\\noccasions appearing in this record, the use of such chemical agents has caused serious physical injury and even\\\\ndeath of inmates.  Pursuant to his statutory authority, the Director of the Department of Corrections issued Policy\\\\nStatement No. 7302.1 dated January 4, 1973, regarding the use of force including chemical agents at all\\\\n414 Oklahoma Correctional Facilities.  Under this policy, only such force was to be *414 employed as was reasonably\\\\nnecessary under all attendant circumstances.  Definite guidelines for implementing the policy included the\\\\nfollowing:\\\\n(a) No person was to lay hands on a prisoner, except in self defense, to prevent an escape, to\\\\nprevent injury to persons or damage to property, or to quell a disturbance.  In controlling or moving\\\\nan unruly prisoner, sufficient personnel were to be used to preclude the necessity for striking or\\\\ninflicting bodily injury.  Gas was not to be used on an individual prisoner except to prevent serious\\\\ninjury or loss of life. Accordingly, physical force was not to be used to force compliance with rules\\\\nor regulations other than under the foregoing circumstances. \\\\n(b) When the use of force was necessary, it was to be exercised according to the priorities of force\\\\nand limited to the minimum degree necessary under the particular circumstances.  When firepower\\\\nwas utilized, the aim would be to disable rather than to kill.  The application of any or all of the\\\\npriorities of force listed below, or the application of a higher numbered priority without first\\\\nemploying a lowered numbered one, was dependent upon and required to be consistent with the\\\\nsituation encountered during any particular disorder.  Priorities of force were:\\\\n1) Physical restraint;\\\\n2) Show of force;\\\\n3) Use of physical force other than weapons fire (Riot Squads);\\\\n4) Use of high pressure water;\\\\n5) Use of chemical agents;\\\\n6) Fire by selected marksmen;\\\\n7) Use of full fire power. \\\\nThe policy statement required that whenever a chemical agent was used on an inmate and/or\\\\ninmates, the Warden would immediately telephone the Director of the Department of Corrections\\\\nor, in his absence, the Deputy Director of Institutions.  The telephonic report was to be followed by\\\\na written report containing all facts and circumstances concerning the incident. \\\\nNotwithstanding these directives, the wardens and other high-level officials at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at\\\\nMcAlester have approved or acquiesced in the use of chemical agents as a purely punitive measure against\\\\ninmates, including even inmates locked in their cells, in violation of the limitations imposed by the Department of\\\\nCorrections.  Mace and tear gas have been used on inmates for such conduct as loud singing in cells, refusing to\\\\nget haircuts or to shave, possession of contraband (such as instant coffee) in cells, destruction of state property\\\\n(such as breaking plastic spoons), cursing an officer, talking in a loud voice or yelling, screaming for a doctor and\\\\nshaking or rattling cell doors.  None of the incidents discussed above were shown to have presented any real or\\\\nimmediate threat to the security of the institution and certainly did not rise to the level of threatening serious injury\\\\nor loss of life. The Court finds as a fact that most, if not all, of these incidents were precisely the type of rules\\\\ninfractions concerning which the use of any type of physical force was intended to be prohibited by the\\\\ndepartmental policy statement.  They were, rather, incidents that should have been dealt with officially, if at all, by\\\\nmeans of the use of the disciplinary system.  Accordingly, it is clear that a pattern and practice exists of using\\\\nchemical agents against inmates when inadequate (if any) consideration was given by the officials involved to the\\\\n\\\\nthreshold question of whether a given situation warranted the use of any physical force at all, whether chemical\\\\nagents or otherwise. \\\\nChemical agents, such as mace and tear gas, have as an inherent characteristic the affecting of individuals other\\\\nthan those against whom they are specifically directed.  This is a fact that has not been given adequate\\\\nconsideration by the defendants and their agents in determining whether such agents should be used in given\\\\n415 situations.  The record reveals incidents in which these various *415 chemical agents were used against\\\\ndisorderly inmates under appropriate circumstances, but in excessive amounts.  The Court finds that while the\\\\nuse of chemical agents was not wholly unjustified, the manner and extent of their use was improper. \\\\nThe record also reveals incidents in which chemical agents were used against specific individual inmates under\\\\ncircumstances justifying the use of physical force as a behavior control measure, but where other reasonable\\\\nmeans of controlling the behavior of the specific inmates existed and where the chemical agents could not be\\\\nused without visiting their effects on other, innocent inmates.  The Court finds that the choice of chemical agents\\\\nas the behavior control device in such instances was not justified. \\\\nThe wardens and other high level officials at the penitentiary have routinely received reports of the improper use\\\\nof chemical agents by correctional officers, but have failed and refused to take any corrective action.  The Director\\\\nof the Department of Corrections is either unaware of or condones the continued violations of the Department\\\\'s\\\\npolicy, since the evidence of record reflects no action having been taken to seek to compel adherence to the\\\\nlimitations imposed by the Department\\\\'s own regulations. \\\\nMedical Care\\\\n17.  Defendants have maintained and operated a medical care delivery system at the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary which was and is incapable of providing, has failed to provide, and continues to fail to provide\\\\nadequate medical care for the inmates. \\\\nThe medical staff and facilities which are located at the main penitentiary at McAlester are relied upon to\\\\ndiagnose and treat the medical, dental and psychiatric problems of inmates throughout the penitentiary system. \\\\nPrior to the riot of July 27, 1973, the on-site medical staff, facilities, equipment and procedures at the Penitentiary\\\\nare systemically incapable of meeting the routine or emergency health care needs of the inmate population.  This\\\\nfacility and the equipment and records it contained were destroyed during the riot.  A temporary hospital ward has\\\\nbeen established in a former cellhouse and the security Captain\\\\'s office is now used as an examination room. \\\\nPortions of the medical research facility adjacent to the penitentiary have also been converted to use as an\\\\nexamination area for trustees.  It is obvious, however, that those inadequacies in plant and equipment which\\\\nexisted prior to the riot were aggravated by the riot and that no effective solution has been formulated. \\\\nProfessional dental care was supplied to the entire population by a series of part time dentists until July of 1973. \\\\nThough a full time dentist was hired at that time, no trained civilian support personnel have been hired to assist\\\\nhim.  This level of dental staffing is unable to meet the routine dental care needs of the population intended to be\\\\nserved.  Indeed, even if there were two dentists and they were provided minimal paradental support, they could\\\\nstill only be expected to treat 50 percent of the dental pathology involved. \\\\nThough approximately one half of the average in-patient population at the penitentiary is hospitalized for\\\\npsychiatric reasons, there is no professional psychiatric staff available for treatment on a regular basis.  A visiting\\\\npsychiatrist makes weekly visits pursuant to an informal agreement, but he has not assumed responsibility for the\\\\ncare of these patients.  The only \\\"treatment\\\" available at the penitentiary consists of temporary relief from\\\\n\\\"distress\\\" through sedation. \\\\nThe professional medical staff available to the inmate male population at the time of trial consisted of one fully\\\\nlicensed, part-time M.D., serving as chief medical officer, and two additional doctors who have institutional\\\\nlicenses which permit them to practice in state institutions, but only under the supervision of a fully licensed\\\\n416 physician.  The *416 services of the institutional licensed physicians have been equally divided between health\\\\ncare of inmates and operation of the plasmaphersis program at the penitentiary so that the services of only one of\\\\n\\\\nthem are normally available at any given time.  The actual services supplied by the chief medical officers have\\\\nvaried.  The chief medical officer at the time of the riot was supplying full time services.  Since his resignation, only\\\\npart-time services are provided by his successor, Dr. Karl Sauer, who also maintains an active, private\\\\northopedics practice in McAlester.  Part of Dr. Sauer\\\\'s time at the penitentiary is required to be spent on\\\\nadministrative matters. \\\\nFor many years, the penitentiary system has, for all practical purposes, been without any professionally trained\\\\nmedical support personnel whatsoever.  Due to shortages in staff, defendants have continuously relied on\\\\nunlicensed, untrained and unqualified correctional officers and other penitentiary employees, as well as inmate\\\\npersonnel, to perform clinical and related medical services which should be performed solely by licensed and\\\\nqualified professionals.  Such services performed by unqualified inmate and civilian personnel include, for\\\\nexample, screening medical complaints to determine which inmates on sick call will actually get to see a doctor,\\\\nas well as providing actual treatment and nursing care.  Subsequent to the riot, defendants have placed even\\\\ngreater reliance on such unqualified personnel at the main facility where almost the entire inmate population was\\\\nbeing held on 24 hour lockdown as recently as the time of this trial. The lockdown has in fact seriously\\\\nexacerbated previously existing problems in the medical area. \\\\nDefendants have endeavored, both before and since the riot, to supply some medical services by referrals to\\\\nvarious outside facilities.  This system of referrals, however, has failed to compensate for on-site deficiencies in\\\\nstaff and facilities and does not and cannot adequately meet the medical needs of the inmates. \\\\nThe past and present systemic medical deficiencies at O.S.P. have resulted in instances of actual impairment of\\\\ninmate health and continue to pose an actual and potential threat to the physical health and well-being of the\\\\nO.S.P. inmate population. \\\\nCorrespondence Rights\\\\n18.  Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of arbitrary and unreasonable restriction, interruption and\\\\ndelay of mail to and from inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. \\\\nDefendants have unduly restricted the inmates\\\\' opportunity to conduct sealed or privileged correspondence with\\\\ncounsel, the courts and other governmental agencies.  Incoming sealed correspondence has never been\\\\npermitted from any source and, until quite recently, all such incoming mail was opened and read.  Outgoing\\\\nsealed correspondence with attorneys, other than the correspondent\\\\'s single \\\"attorney of record,\\\" and to federal\\\\ncourts and government officials has also been denied privileged treatment, even after defendants purported to\\\\nrecognize limited \\\"privileged\\\" correspondence on or about February 2, 1973.  Accordingly, at least some letters to\\\\nand from courts, attorneys and government agencies continued to be opened, read, copied, recorded, and/or\\\\nrejected.  Furthermore, defendants\\\\' policy on privileged correspondence was never fully implemented.  In apparent\\\\ncontravention of that policy, the established practice of officers in charge of the various lockup facilities at the\\\\npenitentiary was to deny any sealed correspondence privilege to their charges. \\\\nAn additional barrier to the confidentiality of such correspondence has been the failure to provide notary services\\\\nwithin the secured areas of the pentitentiary.  Accordingly, legal documents which required notarization could not\\\\nbe sealed by the inmates, inasmuch as they were required to turn these matters in for notarizing, which was\\\\neffected outside their presence. \\\\n417 *417 At the supplemental pretrial conference held on December 6, 1973, counsel for the defendants tendered to\\\\nthe Court and opposing counsel a new Department of Corrections policy statement governing inmate\\\\ncorrespondence.  Implementation of the policy statement was not undertaken until very recently and the record is\\\\nunclear as to the exact manner in which the new policy has been applied in practice.  On its face the document\\\\npermits sealed out-going correspondence without restrictions.  All incoming mail is still to be opened.  Only\\\\ninspection for impermissible enclosures is expressly authorized, but reading is not actually prohibited.  Any\\\\ninspection is required to be conducted in the presence of the inmate addressee, if the mail is from an attorney. \\\\nThis procedure is expressly extended to inmates on lockup or \\\"segregated\\\" status. \\\\n\\\\nUnder the new policy no privilege is recognized with respect to mail from courts and government officials.  There\\\\nis no provision for solving the problem on confidentiality of outgoing mail requiring notarization.  Moreover, any\\\\ninmate whom unidentified officials determine has violated \\\"certain imposed guidelines\\\" will apparently be reduced\\\\nto the limited opportunity to conduct sealed correspondence, as recognized under the old policy. \\\\nThe new mail policy also eliminates a number of restrictions formerly applied to unprivileged mail.  Prior to and\\\\nduring most of the time this case has been pending, defendants severely restricted personal correspondence to\\\\nfive immediate family members, as approved by the penitentiary classification office.  No other \\\"personal\\\"\\\\ncorrespondence was allowed.  Mail of a non-personal nature was permitted, but only if the inmate\\\\'s classification\\\\nofficer made a determination that the particular communication was of a \\\"business\\\" nature.  No written rules or\\\\nguidelines defining \\\"business\\\" mail were ever established or made available either to the inmates or to the\\\\nemployees who were required to make such evaluations.  In practice, classification officers exercised this\\\\nundefined authority in a manner that rejected letters to and from ministers, attorneys, government officials and\\\\nother similar correspondents. \\\\nUnder the new mail policy, inmates may not correspond with outside businesses or institutions for the purpose of\\\\nsoliciting catalogues, fee samples or educational material, or for the purpose of conducting their own business. \\\\nRegardless of purpose, they may not conduct any correspondence with persons known to them only through\\\\nnewspaper or magazine ads, or with persons in prison who are not immediate family members.  There is a\\\\nseparate departmental policy statement governing the practice of religion which prohibits inmates from\\\\ncommunicating with ministers who are exconvicts. \\\\nIn addition to the foregoing expressed limitations, evidence in the record shows that certain inmates have not\\\\nbeen permitted to correspond with a San Francisco, California, prisoner aid group, believed by the inmates to be\\\\na possible source of legal services.  There is no indication of change in defendants\\\\' continuous, but unwritten,\\\\npolicy of prohibiting correspondence of any kind in a foreign language. \\\\nAs indicated above the new policy authorizes inspection, but neither authorizes nor prohibits the reading of\\\\nincoming mail.  On the other hand, there was never any express authority to read inmate mail under the prior\\\\npolicy.  Nevertheless, the actual practice at the penitentiary routinely involved the reading of inmate mail for the\\\\npurpose of discovering and rejecting mail containing \\\"gossip\\\" and \\\"improper language.\\\" There was no expressed\\\\npolicy, purpose, direction or standards for such censorship, so the employees authorized to censor such mail did\\\\nso on an entirely subjective basis. \\\\nPublications\\\\n418 19.  Defendants have in the past prohibited and continue to prohibit inmate *418 subscriptions to, receipt and/or\\\\npossession of certain magazines and newspapers. \\\\nIn the past, the official written rule was that subscriptions could be obtained to any periodicals on the approved\\\\nperiodical list.  In fact, such a list did not exist.  Decisions on individual requests to subscribe to various periodicals\\\\nwere made on a case-by-case basis, by penitentiary personnel, guided by essentially no promulgated standards\\\\nor procedures. \\\\nAfter the riot, a practice was instituted that prevented inmates from subscribing to any newspapers or periodicals. \\\\nQuite recently, there has actually been promulgated an approved periodicals list.  As will be set forth in greater\\\\ndetail, this list still operates to exclude legal and religious periodicals.  No procedure has been promulgated\\\\nwhereby inmates may seek to obtain approval for subscriptions to periodicals not on the approved list.  In fact,\\\\nthey have been advised that all periodicals not on the list are contraband.  The Court takes judicial notice that\\\\ninnumerable publications containing protected speech have not been included on the current approved list. \\\\n\\\\nAccess to the Courts\\\\n20.  The defendants have failed to provide an adequate law library or any reasonably and adequate alternative\\\\nthereto.  The library, such as it is, is located in a wood frame shelter attached to the wall of the main rotunda. \\\\nBecause of its size, approximately ten feet by six feet, only two or, at most, three inmates can use the facility at\\\\nany one time.  The facility is so lacking in legal reference books and publications as to constitute no library at all.\\\\nFor example there are no reports of decisions by the United States Supreme Court or lower Federal Courts. \\\\nInmates are prohibited from assisting one another on legal matters and in preparing their legal papers since such\\\\nassistance may permissibly be provided only by a law librarian.  In practice, penitentiary officials have also\\\\nfollowed a policy of preventing inmates from acquiring legal books.  In addition, inmates have been and are now\\\\nprohibited from subscribing to any legal periodicals and have been denied the right to have in their possession\\\\nany personal legal materials or other assets belonging to them and acquired for the purpose of working on their\\\\nlegal problems, although the latter prohibition has recently been relaxed. \\\\nFor extended periods of time, the law library has been closed to inmates because no librarian was available.  It is\\\\nnoted that during the year 1973, except for approximately six weeks, no law librarian was employed by the\\\\npenitentiary.  During such periods an inmate could use the library only if a classification officer was available to\\\\naccompany him and to and open the library for him.  Approximately 15 percent of the inmate population is illiterate\\\\nand the sixth or seventh grade average reading ability of the population is less than that which is required for\\\\neffective use of the more common legal reference materials.  As is noted above, only the institutional \\\"law\\\\nlibrarian\\\" may permissibly assist these and other inmates on legal matters.  The use of the term \\\"law librarian\\\" is\\\\nmisleading since no librarian employed by the penitentiary has had any legal training.  When such a librarian has\\\\nbeen available he has been able to assist only three or five inmates per day. Inmates frequently must wait up to\\\\nfive weeks to receive assistance, if it is available at all. Inmates on lockup, regardless of the length of\\\\nconfinement, are prohibited from using the law library.  They are only provided with legal forms which may be\\\\nused to file petitions with the courts.  Male inmates from subsidiary facilities must request transfers to the main\\\\nfacility at McAlester in order to use the library facilities.  Women inmates are afforded no library privileges and\\\\nmust depend upon visits from the law librarian, when one is employed and is available.  Recently a new employee\\\\n419 was hired to perform the functions *419 of a law librarian.  This employee is classified as a correctional officer I,\\\\nbut due to illness, has been unavailable for some time.  It is heartening to note from the record that the\\\\ndefendants have made plans for upgrading the law library facilities, employing a full-time attorney and engaging\\\\nthe services of law students to provide legal assistance to inmates.  However, such plans have not as yet been\\\\nimplemented and the conditions mentioned above still prevail. \\\\nReligious Freedom\\\\n21.  Inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary who follow the Muslim faith do not, because of their religious\\\\nbeliefs, eat pork or any food mixed with pork or pork by-products.  Said inmates have on numerous occasions\\\\npetitioned penitentiary officials to provide them with pork free meals.', ' It is\\\\nnoted that during the year 1973, except for approximately six weeks, no law librarian was employed by the\\\\npenitentiary.  During such periods an inmate could use the library only if a classification officer was available to\\\\naccompany him and to and open the library for him.  Approximately 15 percent of the inmate population is illiterate\\\\nand the sixth or seventh grade average reading ability of the population is less than that which is required for\\\\neffective use of the more common legal reference materials.  As is noted above, only the institutional \\\"law\\\\nlibrarian\\\" may permissibly assist these and other inmates on legal matters.  The use of the term \\\"law librarian\\\" is\\\\nmisleading since no librarian employed by the penitentiary has had any legal training.  When such a librarian has\\\\nbeen available he has been able to assist only three or five inmates per day.

Women inmates are afforded no library privileges and\\\\nmust depend upon visits from the law librarian, when one is employed and is available.  Recently a new employee\\\\n419 was hired to perform the functions *419 of a law librarian.  This employee is classified as a correctional officer I,\\\\nbut due to illness, has been unavailable for some time.  It is heartening to note from the record that the\\\\ndefendants have made plans for upgrading the law library facilities, employing a full-time attorney and engaging\\\\nthe services of law students to provide legal assistance to inmates.  However, such plans have not as yet been\\\\nimplemented and the conditions mentioned above still prevail. \\\\nReligious Freedom\\\\n21.  Inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary who follow the Muslim faith do not, because of their religious\\\\nbeliefs, eat pork or any food mixed with pork or pork by-products.  Said inmates have on numerous occasions\\\\npetitioned penitentiary officials to provide them with pork free meals.  Penitentiary officials have refused and still\\\\nrefuse to provide the pork free meals so requested.  Defendants have failed to provide special diets, even when\\\\nrequested by the medical staff for medical patients, and nutritional analyses of penitentiary menus show that\\\\nthere are vitamin and protein deficiencies in the diet generally provided inmates. \\\\nIt is common knowledge that many meals are prepared with pork or pork by-products.  However, the Court cannot\\\\ndetermine with specificity, from the menus placed in the record, the extent to which pork or pork by-products are\\\\nused in the food now served to the inmates.  Of course, pork served in its natural state is easily discernible, but\\\\nmeals seasoned with pork are often difficult of detection.  The record is devoid of any evidence indicating that\\\\ninmates are advised of foods actually prepared with pork or pork by-products.  It naturally follows that those\\\\ninmates whose religious beliefs prevent the eating of pork in any form, are often forced either to chance that the\\\\nfood they eat is free of pork or to refuse the food altogether.  Because of the dietary deficiencies found to exist in\\\\nthe regular meals now being prepared and served to all inmates, the Court finds that inmates who follow the\\\\nMuslim teachings cannot obtain an adequate diet by foregoing the eating of food prepared with pork and will, if\\\\n\\\\nthey attempt to follow the tenets of their faith, receive a diet even more deficient than that received by other\\\\nprisoners. \\\\nMuslim inmates have also been deprived of the oppportunity to gather together for group religious services.  It is\\\\nunclear for what periods this condition prevailed prior to the riot, since there is evidence in the record that some\\\\narrangement for such meetings had been made through the auspices of the Catholic Chaplain.  Subsequent to\\\\nthe riot, there has been a total ban on group religious services regardless of denomination.  This prohibition\\\\nappears to have had a greater impact on the Muslims, because such services provide their only opportunity for\\\\nreligious guidance.  Protestants and Catholics at the penitentiary have at least the services of a civilian chaplain\\\\nwith whom individual consultations may be arranged however brief or unsatisfactory they may be. \\\\nReligious periodicals have not been included on the various official and unofficial approved periodical lists that\\\\nhave been in effect at the penitentiary at diverse times.  Moreover, Muslim publications entitled \\\"Elijah Muhammad\\\\nSpeaks\\\" and \\\"The Message to the Black Man in America\\\" have been and are specifically prohibited by a\\\\ndepartmental policy statement dated April 25, 1968.  No factual justification for the exclusion of these two specific\\\\npublications is shown.  Likewise, no justification whatsoever is shown for the failure to include religious\\\\npublications generally on the various approved periodicals lists. \\\\nMembers of the Muslim sect at McAlester have earnestly urged this Court that their religious principles have been\\\\noffended by their integration with non-Muslim inmates.  For the reasons set forth in the Court\\\\'s discussion of racial\\\\nintegration this aspect of the Muslim complaint will not be honored and must be rejected. \\\\n420 *420 It is also claimed that none of the guards presently employed at the penitentiary are followers of Muslim\\\\nfaith.  The Court has no reason to doubt this assertion, but finds no evidence that this condition has been the\\\\nresult of or has resulted in any direct or covert discrimination based upon religion or race. \\\\nFinally, the Muslim plaintiffs have complained that following the July 27 riot, they were locked up because of their\\\\nreligious beliefs.  The Court notes that the entire population at McAlester was and continues to be locked up\\\\nunder punitive conditions which it finds deplorable.  There is, however, no evidence that Muslims, because of their\\\\nbeliefs, have been subjected to conditions or restrictions more punitive than other inmates of the Penitentiary. \\\\nPrior Findings of this Court\\\\nThe trial in this case was heard on March 14, and 15, 1973, following a series of individual pro se cases\\\\npresented to the court during the week of March 11.  At the close of this trial, the Court entered a series of\\\\npreliminary findings which dealt in general terms with the numerous unconstitutional conditions and practices\\\\nwhich have been described in greater detail herein.  The Court further found from the totality of the record, that\\\\nplaintiff as well as the other inmates at McAlester are entitled to such injunctive and mandatory relief, as is\\\\nnecessary to correct the deprivations of rights which have occurred in the past and will continue unless enjoined\\\\nby order of this Court.\\\\nThe requests for additional relief were, however, denied because of evidence of contributing fault on the part of\\\\ninmates.  Accordingly, it was and is the determination of this Court that the record does not support the award of\\\\nmoney damages to any prisoner nor is there evidence which would warrant the release of any prisoner from\\\\nconfinement prior to serving his full sentence. \\\\nConclusions of Law\\\\nJurisdiction\\\\n1.  This Court has jurisdiction of this case. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1343(3) & (4). \\\\n2.  The Attorney General of the United States was authorized to intervene in this action on behalf of the United\\\\nStates pursuant to Section 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000h-2. \\\\n\\\\n3.  \\\"Federal courts sit not to supervise prisons but to enforce the constitutional rights of all `persons,\\\\' which\\\\ninclude prisoners.  We are not unmindful that prison officials must be accorded latitude in the administration of\\\\nprison affairs, and that prisoners necessarily are subject to appropriate rules and regulations.  But persons in\\\\nprison, like other individuals, have the right to petition that Government for redress of grievances.\\\" Cruz v.\\\\nBeto, 405 U.S. 319, 321, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 1081, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972).  While federal courts are \\\"reluctant to\\\\nintervene in matters of prison administration,\\\" Hoggro v. Pontesso, 456 F.2d 917 (C.A. 10, 1972), the record in\\\\nthis case has led this Court to conclude that the defendants have been and are operating the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary in a manner which violates many rights secured to inmates by the Constitution and laws of the\\\\nUnited States.  \\\"[A] policy of judicial restraint cannot encompass any failure to take cognizance of valid\\\\nconstitutional claims whether arising in a federal or state institution.  When a prison regulation or practice offends\\\\na fundamental constitutional guarantee, federal courts will discharge their duty to protect constitutional rights.  \\\\nJohnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 486, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969).\\\" Procunier v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___,\\\\n94 S.Ct. 1800, 1807, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974). \\\\nRacial Discrimination and Segregation\\\\n421 4.  A state policy or practice of racial segregation in the operation of detention facilities violates the equal *421\\\\nprotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Washington v. Lee, 263 F.Supp. 327 (N.D.Ala.1966), aff\\\\'d; Lee v.\\\\nWashington, 390 U.S. 333, 88 S.Ct. 994, 19 L.Ed.2d 1212 (1968); Wilson v. Kelley, 294 F.Supp. 1005\\\\n(N.D.Ga.1968) aff\\\\'d 393 U.S. 266, 89 S.Ct. 477, 21 L. Ed.2d 425 (1968).  Racial segregation of correctional\\\\nfacilities cannot be justified on the basis that integration may result in inmate violence.  United States v.\\\\nWyandotte County, 480 F.2d 969 (C. A. 10, 1973) (per curiam); cert. denied 414 U.S. 1068, 94 S.Ct. 577, 38\\\\nL.Ed.2d 473 (1973); McClelland v. Sigler, 327 F.Supp. 829 (D.Neb.1971) aff\\\\'d, 456 F. 2d 1266 (C.A. 8, 1972) (per\\\\ncuriam). \\\\n5.  The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits racial discrimination in any aspect of\\\\nprison administration.  Privileges must be afforded equally to prisoners of all races.  Rivers v. Royster, 360 F.2d\\\\n592 (C.A. 4, 1966); Jackson v. Godwin, 400 F.2d 529 (C.A. 5, 1968); Owens v. Brierley, 452 F.2d 640 (C.A. 3,\\\\n1971).  Specifically, prison officials may not discriminate on the basis of race when making job assignments or\\\\nadministering discipline.  Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881, 901 (N.D.Miss., 1972) (appeal\\\\npending). \\\\n6.  The present cessation of segregation in inmate housing coming subsequent to the filing of a lawsuit due to\\\\nemergency conditions beyond defendants\\\\' control is insufficient grounds upon which to conclude there is \\\"no\\\\nreasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.\\\" N. L. R. B. v. Raytheon Co., 398 U.S. 25, 27, 90 S.Ct.\\\\n1547, 1549, 26 L.Ed.2d 21 (1970); United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed.\\\\n1303 (1953). \\\\nIn light of the prolonged practice of segregation prior to the riot in contravention of stated policy, and because of\\\\nthe uncertainty of post-riot conditions and the importance of the rights at stake, judicial relief continues to be both\\\\nappropriate and necessary.  Rowe v. General Motors Corp., 457 F.2d 348 (C. A. 5, 1972); United States v. West\\\\nPeachtree Tenth Corp., 437 F.2d 221, 228 (C.A. 5, 1971). \\\\nProcedural Due Process\\\\n7.  The due process clause proscribes any serious disciplinary sanctions against an inmate unless he is found to\\\\nhave violated written rules which are adequately promulgated prior to the commission of the infraction charged\\\\nand which describe punishable conduct with reasonable precision.  Sinclair v. Henderson, 331 F.Supp. 1123\\\\n(E.D.La.1971); Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss. 1972) (appeal pending). \\\\n8.  Summary punishment is unconstitutional; serious disciplinary sanctions may not be imposed on inmates\\\\nwithout a hearing.  Inmates who are charged with infractions must be given official written notice of the specific\\\\ncharges against them.  This notice must be given a reasonable time prior to conducting the hearing.  Sinclair v.\\\\n\\\\nHenderson, supra; Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971); Nolan v. Scafati, 430 F.2d 548 (C.A. 1, 1970)\\\\n; Landman v. Royster, 333 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Va.1971); see also, Black v. Warden, 467 F.2d 202 (C.A. 10, 1972). \\\\n9.  The determination to impose serious disciplinary sanctions on prisoners must be made by an impartial\\\\ndecision-maker Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971), cert. denied sub nom. Sostre v. Oswald, 404\\\\nU.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972). \\\\n10.  The impartial disciplinary tribunal may not in effect abdicate sentencing responsibility by permitting line\\\\nofficers to determine the length of confinement.  Accordingly, a denial of procedural due process results where\\\\nindefinite lockup sentences are imposed without a regular, meaningful and independent review reasonably\\\\ndesigned to enable the disciplinary tribunal or some other responsible disinterested administrative official or body\\\\n422 to make its own *422 determination regarding duration of confinement. \\\\nSee, Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973); Gray v. Creamer, 465 F.2d 179 (C.A. 3, 1972); United\\\\nStates ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, 467 F.2d 51 (C.A. 2, 1972). \\\\n11.  The imposition of significant additional restrictions or sanctions on inmates who have already been placed on\\\\ndisciplinary lockup requires the same procedural safeguards as apply at the time of the original punishment.  \\\\nAdams v. Carlson, supra; Palmigiano v. Baxter, 487 F.2d 1280, 1284-1285 (C.A. 1, 1973). \\\\n12.  Automatic detention of inmates prior to disciplinary hearings can result in a denial of procedural due process. \\\\nWhether awaiting institutional or judicial proceedings or both, such inmates should be segregated only if a\\\\nreasonable basis exists therefore (e. g., their continued presence in general population status poses an actual\\\\nthreat to the security of the institution) and then only for a reasonable time until the disciplinary committee can\\\\nconvene to hear the case. The pre-riot practice at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary of having the disciplinary\\\\ncommittee meet weekly is not an adequate one for this purpose.  Such hearings must be held as soon as is\\\\npracticable under the circumstances.  Absent unusual and reasonably sufficient extenuating circumstances,\\\\nprehearing detention in excess of 48 hours (72 hours if a weekend intervenes) is presumptively unreasonable.  \\\\nLandman v. Royster, 354 F.Supp. 1292, 1294 (E. D.Va.1973). \\\\n13.  Even where the confinement of an inmate under punitive conditions is denominated and processed as an\\\\nadministrative, rather than a disciplinary matter, the indefinite confinement of inmates under such conditions,\\\\nwithout standards or criteria, and without minimal procedural safeguards, violates the due process clause of the\\\\nFourteenth Amendment.  United States ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, D.C., 338 F.Supp. 311, affirmed, 467 F.2d 51\\\\n(C.A. 2, 1973); Adams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973); Gray v. Creamer, 465 F.2d 179 (C.A. 3, 1973); \\\\nHoward v. Smyth, 365 F.2d 428 (C.A. 4, 1966); Diamond v. Thompson, 364 F.Supp. 659 (M.D.Ala.1973); Allen v.\\\\nNelson, 354 F.Supp. 505 (N.D.Cal.1973); Bowers v. Smith, 353 F.Supp. 1339 (D.Vt.1972). \\\\nCruel and Unusual Punishment\\\\na. In General\\\\n14.  The prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment is applicable to the State of\\\\nOklahoma through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660,\\\\n82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962). \\\\n15.  It is established that the Eighth Amendment does not have fixed, settled and definite limits.  The \\\"Amendment\\\\nmust draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\\\" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100-101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 598, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958).  This Court subscribes to the view\\\\nof the Eighth Circuit:\\\\n\\\"In summary, then so far as the Supreme Court decisions are concerned, we have a flat\\\\nrecognition that the limits of the Eighth Amendment\\\\'s proscription are not easily or exactly defined,\\\\nand we also have clear indications that the applicable standards are flexible, that disproportion,\\\\nboth among punishments and between punishment and crime, is a factor to be considered, and\\\\n\\\\nthat broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency are useful\\\\nand usable.\\\" Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 579 (C.A. 8, 1968).  In short, the parameters of the constitutional prohibition are\\\\nnot rigidly defined and are, in effect, discernible only in the context of specific factual situations. \\\\n423 16.  \\\"Cruel and unusual punishment may be inflicted by the unconscionable *423 penalty imposed by statute or by\\\\nthe inhumane execution of a permissible penalty imposed under a constitutionally permissible statute.\\\" Bethea v.\\\\nCrouse, 417 F.2d 504, 507-508 (C.A. 10, 1969).  While the great majority of cases involving the Eighth\\\\nAmendment have involved one or more specific acts directed at selected individuals (e. g., Trop v. Dulles, supra),\\\\nthe constitutional prohibition is equally applicable to general conditions of confinement.  Holt v. Sarver, 309\\\\nF.Supp. 362, 372-373 (E.D. Ark.1970), aff\\\\'d 442 F.2d 304 (C.A. 8, 1971); Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621\\\\n(E.D.Va.1971); Gates and United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss.1972) (appeal pending). \\\\nb. Use of Chemical Agents\\\\n17.  Chemical mace and tear gas inevitably inflict physical pain and discomfort upon, and can cause permanent\\\\nphysical injury and even death to the individual(s) against whom they are used.  Accordingly, the use of such\\\\nchemical agents to punish inmates constitutes a form of corporal punishment. \\\\n18.  At least in a State such as Oklahoma where State law clearly proscribes the use of corporal punishment, Title\\\\n57 O.S.A. \\u00a7 31, the use of corporal punishment on inmates is also cruel and unusual within the meaning of the\\\\nEighth Amendment. \\\\n19.  Whether or not proscribed by State law, the use of chemical agents such as mace or tear gas as a punitive\\\\nmeasure rather than a control device results in the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the\\\\nEighth Amendment.  Landman v. Royster, 333 F.Supp. 621 (E.D.Va.1971).  See also Morales v. Turman, 364\\\\nF.Supp. 166, 173 (E.D.Tex.1973) (involving Texas juvenile detention facilities). \\\\n20.  That chemical agents have been used as a punitive measure may be inferred from evidence showing that\\\\nsuch agents are employed unnecessarily (i.  e., without proper justification based on a reasonable concern for the\\\\nsecurity of the institution) or with justification, but in excessive amounts.  See Landman v. Royster, supra.\\\\n21.  The established pattern of unreasonable and excessive use of chemical agents at the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary has resulted in summary, as well as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and\\\\nFourteenth Amendments. \\\\nc. Conditions of Confinement\\\\n22.  Solitary confinement per se does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661\\\\n(C.A. 5, 1971); Graham v. Willingham, 384 F.2d 367 (C.A. 10, 1967).  Such confinement may constitute cruel and\\\\nunusual punishment, however, if it is maintained in a manner fairly characterized as foul, inhuman and violative of\\\\nbasic concepts of human decency, Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 526 (C.A. 2, 1967).  In most of the cases in\\\\nwhich the conditions in solitary confinement have been condemned, the inmates were held in dark cells where\\\\npersonal hygiene was impossible due to the lack of materials necessary for personal sanitation and/or the\\\\ninability to properly dispose of body waste.  See e. g., LaReau v. MacDougall, 473 F.2d 974 (C.A. 2, 1972) cert.\\\\ndenied, 414 U.S. 878, 94 S.Ct. 49, 38 L.Ed.2d 123 (1973); Wright v. McMann, supra; Hancock v. Avery, 301\\\\nF.Supp. 786 (M.D.Tenn. 1969); Jordan v. Fitzharris, 257 F. Supp. 674 (N.D.Cal.1966).  Such conditions have\\\\nprevailed in the subterranean isolation area referred to as \\\"the hole.\\\" The conditions found to exist in the isolation\\\\ncells in the maximum security unit approach, but do not, standing alone, reach the level of cruel and unusual\\\\npunishment.  Nevertheless, confinement in dark, unventilated and unsanitary isolation cells without any means of\\\\nmental or emotional diversion if imposed for prolonged periods will result in conditions which equal cruel and\\\\nunusual punishment.  See, Morales v. Turman, 364 F.Supp. 166 (E.D.Tex.1973).  Cf. Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661,\\\\n424 671 (C.A. 5, *424 1971) (partial dissenting opinion); Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971) cert. denied\\\\nsub nom. Sostre v. Oswald, 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972). \\\\n\\\\n23.  Prisoners held in segregation for security or other non-disciplinary reasons must be provided as many of the\\\\nprivileges enjoyed by the general population as the nature of their confinement allows.  Landman v. Royster, 354\\\\nF.Supp. 1292, 1294-1295 (E.D.Va. 1973); Allen v. Nelson, supra.\\\\n24.  Where inmates are confined to their cells for periods up to one year and subjected to continual and enforced\\\\nidleness without affording them any opportunities for physical exercise, voluntary work, or educational programs,\\\\nit must be concluded that such conditions of confinement constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of\\\\nthe Eighth Amendment.  Hamilton v. Love, 328 F.Supp. 1182 (E.D.Ark., 1971); Sinclair v. Henderson, 331 F. Supp.\\\\n1123 (E.D.La.1971); cf.Osborn v. Manson, 359 F.Supp. 1107 (D.Conn. 1973). \\\\nd. Denial of Medical Care\\\\n25.  Inmates have a basic right to receive needed medical care while they are confined in prison.  Edwards v.\\\\nDuncan, 355 F.2d 993 (C.A. 4, 1966); Coppinger v. Townsend, 398 F.2d 392 (C. A. 10, 1968); Schack v. Florida,\\\\n391 F. 2d 593 (C.A. 5, 1968), cert. denied, 392 U.S. 916, 88 S.Ct. 2080, 20 L.Ed.2d 1376 (1968); Martinez v.\\\\nMancusi, 443 F.2d 921 (C.A. 2, 1970); Sawyer v. Sigler, 320 F.Supp. 690 (D.Neb.1970), aff\\\\'d 445 F.2d 818 (C.A.\\\\n8, 1971). \\\\n26.  As a necessary corollary of that right, prison officials have an affirmative duty to make available to inmates a\\\\nlevel of medical care which is reasonably designed to meet the routine and emergency health care needs of\\\\ninmates.  Fitzke v. Shappell, 468 F.2d 1072 (C.A. 6, 1972); Campbell v. Beto, 460 F.2d 765 (C.A. 5, 1972); Gates\\\\nand United States v. Collier, 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss.1972) (appeal pending); Newman v. Alabama, 349\\\\nF.Supp 278 (M.D.Ala.1972) (appeal pending); cf.Jones v. Wittenberg, 330 F.Supp. 707 (N.D.Ohio, 1971) affirmed\\\\nsub nom. Jones v. Metzer, 456 F.2d 854 (C.A. 6, 1972); Chapman v. Gilligan, No. 8700 (S.D.Ohio, March 16,\\\\n1973).  While a prisoner is not entitled to the medical care of his choice, Coppinger v. Townsend, supra, Judge\\\\nDaugherty has held that \\\"a failure to provide needed medical care by one having custody of a prisoner may under\\\\ncertain circumstances afford a prisoner a cause of action under Civil Rights Act.\\\" (Elsberry v. Haynes, 256\\\\nF.Supp. 738 (W.D.Okl.1966). \\\\n27.  The actionable circumstances result where, as here, the level of medical care available to a confined and\\\\ndependent population is inadequate to meet predictable health care needs because of obvious and sustained\\\\ndeficiencies in professional staff, facilities and equipment.  When continued and systemic deficiencies of this\\\\nnature exist and have resulted in the actual impairment of inmate health, and when such deficiencies continue to\\\\npose a current and potential threat to the physical health and wellbeing of an entire prison population, then\\\\ninmates are deprived of the basic elements of adequate medical treatment in violation of the Eighth Amendment,\\\\nCampbell v. Beto, supra, and are also subjected to disabilities beyond those contemplated by incarceration, in\\\\nviolation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Fritzke v. Shappell, supra.\\\\nCorrespondence and Publication\\\\n28.  Inmates have a preferred constitutional right to correspond with attorneys, courts and government officials for\\\\nthe purpose of petitioning government and the courts for the redress of grievances.  LeVier v. Woodson, 443 F.2d\\\\n360 (C.A. 10, 1971); Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (C.A. 2, 1971) cert. denied sub nom. Sostre v. Oswald,\\\\n425 404 U.S. 1049, 92 S.Ct. 719, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972); Palmigiano v. Travisono, *425 317 F.Supp. 776 (D.R.I.1970)\\\\n.  The confidentiality of such correspondence may not be arbitrarily denied by prison officials, who are the likely\\\\nsubjects of an inmate\\\\'s grievances.  Defendants\\\\' practice of limiting confidential treatment to correspondence with\\\\none attorney, state courts and state government officials, but not with their federal counterparts, constitutes an\\\\narbitrary and unreasonable intrusion upon the inmates\\\\' right freely to petition their government and the courts. \\\\nSee, Palmigiano v. Travisono, supra.\\\\n29.  This Court does not conclude that prison officials may not regulate or restrict forms of prisoner mail.  Because\\\\nof its impact on the First Amendment rights of \\\"freeworld\\\" as well as inmate correspondents, however, the\\\\ncensorship of such mail must meet the constitutional standards which are generally applied to governmental\\\\n\\\\nregulation of protected speech.  Accordingly, it must be shown that prison mail censorship furthers an important\\\\ngovernmental interest unrelated to the suppression of speech and that the mode of censorship results in\\\\nlimitations which are no greater than are necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental\\\\ninterest involved.  Procunier v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___, 94 S. Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); United States v.\\\\nO\\\\'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).  Prison mail regulations which automatically limit\\\\ninmates to personal correspondence with a fixed number of immediate family members work an arbitrary and\\\\nunconstitutional prior restraint on the protected speech of both inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents. \\\\nSuch overly broad restrictions have been imposed on inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary solely to serve\\\\nthe administrative convenience of the defendants, without furthering any demonstrated interest in the orderly\\\\noperation of the institution or the rehabilitation of its inmates.  Procunier v. Martinez, supra; Morales v. Schmidt,\\\\n489 F.2d 1335 (C. A. 7, January 17, 1973) (rehearing en banc, May 29, 1973, 494 F.2d 85); LeMon v. Zelker, 358\\\\nF.Supp. 554 (S.D.N.Y. 1972). \\\\n30.  Defendants\\\\' policy of intercepting, censoring and rejecting incoming and outgoing inmate correspondence\\\\nbased on unwritten and/or ill-defined prohibitions against \\\"improper language\\\" or \\\"gossip\\\" including \\\"false\\\\nstatements to any correspondents\\\" is overbroad on its face and has in fact been applied in such a manner as to\\\\ninfringe upon the protected speech of inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents.  Procunier v. Martinez, supra;\\\\nAdams v. Carlson, 352 F.Supp. 882 (E.D.Ill.1973) reversed in part on other grounds, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973);\\\\ncf.LeMon v. Zelker, supra; Palmigiano v. Travisono, supra.\\\\n31.  Whether based upon the identity or characteristics of the correspondents (as in the case of approved list\\\\nrestrictions), or upon the content of their specific communications (such as \\\"gossip\\\" and \\\"improper language\\\"),\\\\nthe restriction and/or censorship of prison mail deprives both inmates and their \\\"freeworld\\\" correspondents of the\\\\n\\\"liberty\\\" of free speech.  Accordingly, due process requires that the determination to censor must be based on\\\\nfacts rationally determined pursuant to such procedures as are necessary to insure fairness.  Such minimum\\\\nprocedural safeguards include notice to the interested correspondent(s) and a reasonable opportunity to protest\\\\nthe decision of a prison official other than the person who originally disapproved the correspondence.  Martinez v.\\\\nProcunier, D.C., 354 F.Supp. 1092, affirmed, Procunier v. Martinez, supra.\\\\n32.  Restrictions on the free flow of information to prison inmates in the form of general circulation newspapers\\\\nand magazines results in a denial of the First Amendment rights of such inmates, unless the State can show that\\\\n426 such restrictions are reasonably necessary to the preservation of security, good order or discipline within the *426\\\\npenitentiary or the rehabilitation of the inmates.  Fortune Society v. McGinnis, 319 F.Supp. 901 (S.D.N.Y.1970); \\\\nLaaman v. Hancock, 351 F.Supp. 1265 (D. N.H.1972).  The past and present restrictive practices of the\\\\ndefendants, pertaining to the acquisition and retention of general circulation newspapers and magazines have\\\\ngone far beyond any possible legitimate needs based on the preservation of security, good order or discipline\\\\nwithin the penitentiary or the rehabilitation of the inmates.  Such rules that have existed and such practices as\\\\nhave been in effect have been arbitrary and capricious on their face and as applied.  The legitimate interest of\\\\ninmates in having access to the information, both social and educational, to be found in these various types of\\\\nperiodicals far outweighs any legitimate interest of penal administration or any proper regard to be afforded the\\\\nexpertise and discretionary authority of competent correctional officials.  When prison officials conclude that\\\\neffective security, good order or rehabilitation require the censorship of such material, then with respect to each\\\\nobjectionable publication, the basis for the determination, including a written notice setting forth the relevant facts\\\\nwith respect to the particular publication, shall be provided to each inmate who seeks to obtain it.  Such inmates\\\\nshall be provided a reasonable opportunity to submit additional facts and views to the decision maker before such\\\\ndetermination becomes final.  Laaman, supra; Sostre v. Otis, 330 F.Supp. 941 (S.D.N.Y.1971); See Procunier v.\\\\nMartinez, supra. If it is possible to do so without defeating the purpose of the proposed exclusion, the inmate\\\\nshould be allowed to examine the allegedly offensive material and set forth reasons in writing as to why he feels it\\\\nshould not be excluded.  In any event, the actual, final decision to exclude a specific issue of any general\\\\ncirculation publication shall be made by the Warden or Deputy Warden, who shall prepare and retain on file a\\\\ndetailed statement of the specific basis for each such exclusion for any jurisdictional court review. \\\\n\\\\nAccess To The Courts\\\\n33.  Prisoners, no less than other persons, have a constitutional right of access to the courts.  Johnson v. Avery,\\\\n393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L. Ed.2d 718 (1969).  \\\"`Regulations and practices that unjustifiably obstruct the\\\\navailability of professional representation or other aspects of the right of access to the courts are invalid.\\\\' Ex parte\\\\nHull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L. Ed.2d 1034 (1941).\\\" Procunier v. Martinez, supra.\\\\n34.  To be meaningful, the right of access to the courts must include the means to frame and present legal issues\\\\nand relevant facts effectively for judicial consideration. \\\\n35.  Because the state has substantial control over the activities of convicted prisoners and because many\\\\nprisoners are indigent and poorly educated, prison officials have an affirmative constitutional duty to provide them\\\\nwith the necessary means for obtaining access to courts. \\\\nPrison law libraries are a basic means of assisting inmates to that end.  Gilmore v. Lynch, 319 F.Supp. 105 (N.D.\\\\nCal.1970), affirmed, Younger v. Gilmore, 404 U.S. 15, 92 S.Ct. 250, 30 L.Ed.2d 142 (1971); Hooks v. Wainwright,\\\\n352 F. Supp. 163 (M.D.Fla.1972).  The defendants have, at various times and in various ways, attempted to\\\\nprovide some form of legal assistance to inmates.  The Court concludes however that the law library and legal\\\\nassistance program at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary have failed to provide these disadvantaged inmates with\\\\nconstitutionally adequate access to the courts.  Johnson v. Avery supra; Gilmore v. Lynch, supra; Hooks v.\\\\nWainwright, supra.\\\\n\\\"The constitutional guarantee of due process of law has as a corollary the requirement that\\\\n427 prisoners be afforded access to the courts in order to *427 challenge unlawful convictions and to\\\\nseek redress for violations of their constitutional rights.\\\" Procunier v. Martinez, supra. (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the requirement levied on\\\\nthe State of Oklahoma in this area of constitutional application extends to insuring adequate access to the courts\\\\nregarding at least habeas corpus actions, civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 and out-of-time appeals.  Cf.\\\\nJustice After Trial: Prisoners\\\\' Need for Legal Services in the Criminal Correctional Process, 18 Kan.L.Rev.  493\\\\n(1970). \\\\n36.  A state may not prohibit inmate self-help or mutual inmate assistance in legal matters unless it provides them\\\\nwith some reasonable, alternative means of protecting their right of access to the courts.  Johnson v. Avery, supra.\\\\nDefendants in this case have unconstitutionally interfered with inmates\\\\' protected attempts to obtain timely,\\\\neffective access to the courts in numerous ways.', 'Procunier v. Martinez, supra.\\\\n34.

A state may not prohibit inmate self-help or mutual inmate assistance in legal matters unless it provides them\\\\nwith some reasonable, alternative means of protecting their right of access to the courts.  Johnson v. Avery, supra.\\\\nDefendants in this case have unconstitutionally interfered with inmates\\\\' protected attempts to obtain timely,\\\\neffective access to the courts in numerous ways.  This unconstitutional interference has extended to attempts by\\\\ninmates to seek and receive the assistance of attorneys, Procunier v. Martinez, supra; to acquire, retain and use\\\\npersonal legal materials such as law books, legal periodicals, and such other assets as are used in the course of\\\\nworking on one\\\\'s personal legal problems, Cruz v. Hauck, 404 U.S. 59, 92 S.Ct. 313, 30 L.Ed.2d 217 (1971),\\\\nAdams v. Carlson, 488 F.2d 619 (C.A. 7, 1973), and to assist one another in the preparation of legal documents\\\\nin the absence of a constitutionally adequate alternative.  Johnson v. Avery, supra; See also, Procunier v.\\\\nMartinez, supra.\\\\nReligious Freedom\\\\n37.  Where the precepts of a religious sect call for its adherents to engage in a religious practice which does not\\\\npresent a threat to the security, discipline and good order of the institution, the state has the burden of justifying\\\\npolicies or practices which prevent such inmates from engaging in such religious practices.  See, Cooper v. Pate,\\\\n378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1964); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263\\\\n(1972); Long v. Parker, 390 F.2d 816 (C.A. 3, 1968); Brown v. Peyton, 437 F.2d 1228 (C.A. 4, 1971). \\\\n38.  The court finds no valid justification for defendants continuing policy of denying inmates including Muslims the\\\\nopportunity to gather together for corporate religious services.  Walker v. Blackwell, 411 F.2d 23 (C.A. 5, 1969); \\\\n\\\\nLong v. Parker, 390 F.2d 816; Northern v. Nelson, 315 F.Supp. 687 (N.D.Cal.1970); affirmed, 448 F.2d 1266 (C.A.\\\\n9, 1971); Banks v. Havener, 234 F.Supp. 27 (E.D.Va.1964); Williford v. California, 352 F.2d 474 (C.A. 9, 1965). \\\\n39.  In the instant case, the defendants have not offered any justification to support their food distribution practices\\\\nwhich prevent Muslim inmates from adhering to their religious practice of abstaining from the consumption of pork\\\\nand pork by-products.  Such practices cannot be squared with the First Amendment rights of the inmates and, on\\\\nthe basis of the record in this case, are an unconstitutional application of state power.  See, Barnett v. Rodgers,\\\\n133 U.S.App.D.C.  296, 410 F.2d 995 (1969). \\\\n40.  In order to justify a proscription against religious publications, including Muslim literature, officials have the\\\\nburden of showing that such publications present a threat to security, discipline and good order within the\\\\ninstitution that cannot otherwise be overcome.  Rowland v. Jones, 452 F.2d 1005 (C.A. 8, 1971); Brown v. Peyton,\\\\nsupra; Long v. Parker, supra. In the instant case no such showing has been made with respect to the prohibited\\\\npublications entitled \\\"Message to the Black Man\\\" and \\\"Muhammad Speaks.\\\" Relief\\\\n41.  It is within the authority and is indeed the responsibility of this court to order that all violations of federal\\\\n428 constitutional and civil rights, *428 and of rights and privileges secured by the laws, regulations and policies of\\\\nthe State of Oklahoma, cease forthwith.  The Court is loath to consider the necessity of closing the Oklahoma\\\\nState Penitentiary at McAlester as a direct or indirect result of its orders.  Inmates v. Eisanstadt, 360 F.Supp. 676,\\\\n691 (D. Mass.1973) affirmed, 494 F.2d 1196 (C. A. 1, 1974); Cf.Hamilton v. Love, 328 F.Supp. 1182, 1194\\\\n(E.D.Ark.1971).  Notwithstanding the grossly offensive conditions and treatment of inmates found to exist at the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester, it is also within the authority of this Court to refrain, in its discretion,\\\\nfrom entering at this time any order that would require or have the effect of requiring the closing of the\\\\npenitentiary.  The Court concludes that, at this time, the interests of all parties to the case and the public interest\\\\nwould be best served by the Court affording the authorities of the State of Oklahoma and of the Oklahoma State\\\\nPenitentiary the opportunity to bring conditions and treatment of inmates at the penitentiary into conformity with\\\\nthe requirements of the United States Constitution, federal civil rights laws, and the laws, regulations and policies\\\\nof the State of Oklahoma. \\\\nJUDGMENT, DECREE, INJUNCTION AND ORDER FOR REMEDIAL\\\\nACTION\\\\nIn accordance with the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth above, and because of the determination\\\\nby the Court that it is necessary for an order to issue in this case and to be in effect during the time that may be\\\\nnecessary for the formulation, approval and implementation of plans for complete relief, it is\\\\nOrdered that the defendants, their officers, agents, servants, employees and all other persons in active concert or\\\\nparticipation with them, and all their successors in office, who receive actual or constructive notice of this Order\\\\nby personal service or otherwise as hereinafter provided, are hereby enjoined from operating the facilities of the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary McAlester, Oklahoma, in any manner inconsistent with the following provision of this\\\\nOrder:\\\\nOrder on Racial Segregation and Discrimination\\\\n1.  Racial discrimination in any aspect of the operations of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary shall cease forthwith\\\\nand forever. \\\\n2.  All future cell or other housing assignments at the penitentiary, whether initial or subsequent, shall be made in\\\\naccordance with a classification and assignment system in which the race of the inmate is not a factor\\\\nconsidered.  All requests by inmates for transfers from one cell or other housing assignment to another shall also\\\\nbe processed and decided without regard for the race of the inmate making the transfer request. \\\\n\\\\nIn order to insure that the mandates set forth in this paragraph are not allowed to operate so as to perpetuate\\\\nsegregation or facilitate resegregation, the warden shall set as a goal that all major housing units (cell blocks,\\\\ndormitories, runs, etc.) should generally approximate in their respective racial compositions the racial composition\\\\nof the inmate population as a whole.  This is not to be an inflexible rule, as legitimate considerations within the\\\\noperating scope of a valid, non-racially biased classification and assignment system may well produce some\\\\nimbalances in this regard.  The warden shall, however, on a quarterly basis, report to the Director of the\\\\n[*]\\\\nDepartment of Corrections, with copies to all counsel of record in this case,  a detailed justification for each\\\\nmajor housing unit that deviates more than 10% in either direction in the racial composition of its population from\\\\nthe racial composition of the inmate population as a whole. \\\\n429 *429 The warden of the penitentiary shall insure that there is no segregation within major housing units of the\\\\npenitentiary. \\\\n3.  All inmates shall have an equal opportunity to be considered fairly for assignment to and advancement within\\\\nall jobs that are or may become available at the penitentiary.  To assist in insuring that this is achieved, no\\\\npreference shall be given in future job assignments on the basis of any inmate\\\\'s previous work experience at the\\\\npenitentiary, where such preference would have a racially discriminatory effect.  Validly applicable work\\\\nexperience prior to entering the penitentiary and any relevant formal education or training may of course be\\\\nconsidered. \\\\n4.  Records will hereafter be maintained at the penitentiary which will include the identity of the person(s) making\\\\neach initial or subsequent job or housing assignment and the basis for such assignment.  If the previous practice\\\\nof assigning inmates only to departments or industries for work is reinstituted, with the specific job assignments\\\\nbeing made within the gaining department or industry, the records of the penitentiary shall include this same\\\\ninformation regarding each job assignment or reassignment within each department or industry.  If there are job\\\\npromotions available to inmates, the records concerning each promotion actually effected shall include the\\\\nreason(s) why the promoted inmate was selected and the name(s) of the other inmate(s) considered for that\\\\npromotion. \\\\n5.  Affirmative action to overcome the effects of past discrimination in the operation of housing, dining and\\\\nrecreational facilities, job assignments and the disciplinary system shall be formulated and implemented. \\\\nConceding that certain of these operations are either not carried on at the present time, or are carried on at a\\\\nlevel far below that which was in effect prior to July 27, 1973, it must nonetheless be recognized that the\\\\nrestoration of normal operations at the penitentiary could present the grave likelihood of the past pattern and\\\\npractice of pervasive racial discrimination being restored as well. \\\\nThe defendants shall, within 60 days from the date of this Order, formulate and submit to counsel for the plaintiffs\\\\nand the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the court for consideration and approval, their plan for the total\\\\neradication of any present segregation and other forms of racial discrimination, for overcoming the continuing\\\\npresent effects of segregation and other forms of racial discrimination as heretofore practiced at the Oklahoma\\\\nState Penitentiary, and for precluding the reinstitution of any discriminatory practices which were in effect prior to\\\\nJuly 27, 1973. \\\\nThe plan so submitted shall include, but not be limited to, provisions for the on-going examination of all operating\\\\nprocedures within the penitentiary for possible discriminatory effects; provisions for training present and future\\\\nstaff in the area of human relations, and the timetable for conducting such training; provisions for effective\\\\nstatistical and other checks and reviews at the administration level within the penitentiary; and provisions for\\\\nadditional checks and reviews within the Department of Corrections. \\\\nThe plan so submitted shall also include the details of a procedure for the review and analysis of records\\\\nmaintained pursuant to paragraph 4 of this order.  To overcome the effects of past discrimination in job\\\\nassignments, the plan will also include a requirement, as to any specific job category wherein the racial\\\\ncomposition of the inmate group assigned to that job category deviates more than 10% in either direction from\\\\nthe racial composition of the inmate population as a whole, that a detailed justification for each such deviation be\\\\n\\\\nprepared on a quarterly basis.  Such justifications shall be submitted over the signature of the warden of the\\\\npenitentiary to the director of the Department of Corrections and to all counsel of record in this case.\\\\n430 *430 To insure the eradication of discrimination in the operation of the penitentiary disciplinary system, the plan\\\\nshall also include provision for appropriate training for all individuals who prepare, investigate, review or process\\\\ninmate disciplinary reports, as well as all individuals who sit on or review the results of the proceedings of\\\\ndisciplinary committees, and all individuals who review, approve or consider appeals from the results of such\\\\ndisciplinary proceedings. \\\\nOrder of Procedural Due Process\\\\n6.  The Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pertaining to this subject make it indisputably clear that the\\\\ndisciplinary system as it existed and exists at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary has failed to meet constitutional\\\\nrequirements in almost every possible regard.  Nonetheless, the Court is not unmindful of the disparate views that\\\\nexist among judges, penologists and experts as to precisely what quantum of process is \\\"due\\\" in all of the\\\\ndifferent kinds of disciplinary proceedings that necessarily go on in a penitentiary.  A similar disparity of views\\\\nexists with regard to many of the administrative decisions that must be made in the ordinary course of prison\\\\nadministration, but which can have serious effects on the inmates concerned.  The Court is firmly of the opinion\\\\nthat the best disciplinary system is one that is universal, in the sense of being carefully constructed to deal\\\\nappropriately, but nonetheless fairly, with all of the varying kinds and degrees of offenses and rules infractions\\\\nthat can be and are committed in this or any other penitentiary.  The same is true with regard to the administrative\\\\ndecision-making process by means of which significant administrative decisions affecting inmates are made. \\\\n7.  Accordingly, the Court will make no effort at this time to prescribe a complete set of rules and regulations\\\\nregarding procedural due process, or even to provide detailed guidelines as to what would constitute an\\\\nappropriate and constitutional disciplinary system for the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, nor will it do so regarding\\\\nthose aspects of the penitentiary\\\\'s administrative decision-making process that have led to constitutional\\\\nviolations in the past.  If it is possible to do so, it is far preferable for those provisions necessary to overcome past\\\\nconstitutional deficiencies to be fashioned as part of an organic whole 00 that is, of a comprehensive system. \\\\n97\\\\n8.  In the course of the preparation for and presentation of this case, counsel for the plaintiffs, the plaintiff-\\\\nintervenor and the defendants have gained a possibly unique perception of the problems herein involved.  The\\\\nCourt therefore directs counsel for the parties to confer and attempt in good faith and in a spirit of cooperation to\\\\nfashion a detailed, comprehensive disciplinary system for the penitentiary system to which all parties can agree in\\\\na submission to the Court. The Court further directs counsel so to confer regarding the administrative mechanism\\\\n(s) by means of which decisions are made that significantly impinge upon the rights, interest, welfare and\\\\nrehabilitative potential of the inmates of the penitentiary.  Even if total agreement concerning these matters is not\\\\npromptly achieved, the Court directs that counsel persist in their efforts and insure that as much as possible is\\\\nworked out through the process of negotiation and agreement.  The final product of this undertaking will be\\\\nsubmitted to the Court for consideration and approval not more than 60 days from the date of this decree, and will\\\\nbe accompanied by (if necessary) submissions on behalf of each party regarding those points concerning which\\\\nagreement has not been possible and constitutional interests are involved. \\\\n9.  The purpose of the Court in promulgating the foregoing portion of its decree is to attempt to insure that the\\\\ndisciplinary system and the administrative decision-making machinery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary are\\\\nconstitutional in all respects, but are at the same time adequate to fulfill the real needs of discipline and\\\\n431 administration *431 within the penitentiary.  These goals are not mutually exclusive. \\\\n10.  In the interim, the following rules shall apply:\\\\na. No inmate shall be disciplined in any manner except for violation of a written rule, promulgated\\\\nprior to the commission of the offense charged, which, in general terms at least, was adequate to\\\\nhave given the inmate reasonable notice that the conduct subsequently alleged as the basis for\\\\nthe charge could constitute a punishable act; this does not, of course, require that every possible\\\\n\\\\nset of facts that could be charged must be set forth with particularity, but it does prohibit punishing\\\\nan inmate for conduct that he did not reasonably know could be the basis for punishment;\\\\nb. No summary punishment shall be inflicted, although this does not preclude a correctional officer\\\\nfrom reprimanding or warning an inmate that repetition or continuation of particular conduct could\\\\nor will result in a disciplinary charge being filed;\\\\nc. Inmates charged with infractions must be given official written notice of the charges against\\\\nthem and, in reasonably specific terms, the conduct that formed the basis for the charge, said\\\\nnotice to be given a reasonable time prior to any hearing that must or may be held on such\\\\ncharges;\\\\nd. No written charge shall be disposed of nor significant disciplinary sanction imposed on any\\\\ninmate without a hearing at which the inmate is accorded a reasonable opportunity to be heard\\\\nand to present his defense to, explanation of, or matters in mitigation regarding the charge(s)\\\\nagainst him;\\\\ne. The members of the disciplinary hearing shall be impartial; as a minimum, no person who was\\\\ninvolved in bringing, investigating or processing any charge shall sit on the panel that determines\\\\nthe guilt of the inmate of that charge or the punishment, if any, to be imposed as a result. \\\\nf. Disciplinary charges against inmates shall be disposed of, by hearing or otherwise, as soon as\\\\npracticable and such disposition shall not be delayed pending possible action in the civil courts\\\\nconcerning the same or related matters. \\\\ng. If disciplinary sanctions are imposed that include indefinite terms in lockup, disciplinary\\\\nsegregation, etc., there shall be a review of the need for the continuation of such status on a\\\\nregular basis, either by the disciplinary panel that imposed the sanction, by an alternate or\\\\namended panel the members of which are impartial as defined above, or by a high-ranking,\\\\ndisinterested administrative official at the penitentiary; no correctional officer performing duty in\\\\nthe lockup area where the inmate is confined shall participate in the process of deciding whether\\\\ncontinued confinement is warranted, except that he may make such reports as to the inmate\\\\'s\\\\nbehavior as are routinely required by penitentiary regulations and may make recommendations,\\\\nwith reasons therefor, as to whether continued confinement is so warranted;\\\\nh. Inmates on disciplinary lockup shall not be subjected to significant additional restrictions or\\\\nsanctions except in accordance with a procedure that comports with the requirements of\\\\nparagraph 10 a-f, supra.\\\\ni.  Inmates who allegedly commit offenses or other rules infractions shall not be placed in pre-\\\\nhearing detention unless a reasonable basis exists therefor, such as the fact that their continued\\\\npresence in general population poses an actual threat to the security of the institution; absent\\\\nunusual and sufficient circumstances, pre-hearing detention in excess of 48 hours (72 hours if a\\\\nweekend is involved) shall be presumptive evidence of a violation of paragraph 10 f of this Order;\\\\nand\\\\nj. To insure that no inmate is punished in violation of the provisions of this paragraph through a\\\\n432 process of *432 denominating the procedure employed \\\"administrative,\\\" rather than \\\"disciplinary\\\"\\\\nin nature, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply generally to any administrative action to be\\\\ntaken that could result in the inmate being confined under punitive conditions; if an inmate is\\\\nplaced in administrative segregation pending investigation of serious charges against him, the\\\\nreview process required by paragraph 10 g shall insure that the investigation is being conducted\\\\nwith all practicable expedition, or the inmate shall be released from such status. \\\\n\\\\nOrder on Conditions of Confinement\\\\n11.  Any future use of that form of disciplinary status which was known officially as \\\"72 hour detention\\\" and which\\\\ninvolved confinement in the subterranean isolation area commonly known as \\\"the hole\\\" is prohibited. \\\\n12.  Effective immediately, before any inmate is confined in an isolation cell in the Maximum Security Unit,\\\\ncompliance with the procedures of paragraph 10, supra, is required. \\\\nWithin 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall submit to counsel for the plaintiff and the plaintiff-\\\\nintervenor for comment, and to the court for consideration and approval, a proposed set of comprehensive\\\\nregulations intended to govern future confinement in the isolation cells in the Maximum Security Unit.  These\\\\nproposed regulations shall set forth the conditions and treatment to be provided inmates confined in such cells\\\\nand a maximum time limit for the duration of such confinement.  Prior to submitting these proposed regulations to\\\\nthe Court, the defendants shall have said regulations reviewed by competent medical authorities, not employed\\\\nby or connected with the Department of Corrections, who shall also inspect the isolation cells themselves.  No\\\\nproposed set of regulations shall be submitted to the Court that is not accompanied by a statement from said\\\\nmedical authorities to the effect that confinement in these cells, under the conditions included in the proposed\\\\nregulations and found to exist at the time the cells are inspected by said medical authorities, under the treatment\\\\nprocedures called for in the proposed regulations, and for the maximum duration provided for in the proposed\\\\nregulations, does not constitute an unreasonable risk to the physical or psychological well-being of an inmate so\\\\nconfined. \\\\n13.  Inmates who are confined in any form of administrative segregation shall be accorded as many of the\\\\nprivileges enjoyed by general population inmates, to the extent enjoyed by those inmates, as the nature and\\\\npurpose of their confinement in administrative segregation will allow.  This provision applies, notwithstanding the\\\\nfact of compliance, where appropriate, with the provisions of paragraph 10, supra.\\\\n14.  All inmates shall be afforded a reasonable time outside their cells, daily, for the purpose of exercise or other\\\\nform of recreation.  This provision shall be effective 10 days from the date of this decree.  Weather permitting,\\\\ngeneral population inmates shall be allowed outdoors during at least part of this exercise period.  If at all possible,\\\\ninmates in administrative segregation and disciplinary segregation shall also be allowed outdoors for this\\\\npurpose. \\\\n15.  Within 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall cause to be made a study of the actual diet\\\\nbeing furnished to the inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.  This study shall be conducted by an individual\\\\n(s) qualified in the areas of diet and nutrition.  The results of this study shall be submitted in the form of a report to\\\\nthe Court, with copies to counsel for the plaintiff and the plaintiff-intervenor, and shall cover at least the caloric\\\\nand nutritional adequacy of said diet.  The report shall also address itself to the specific question of whether\\\\nMuslim inmates are receiving the opportunity to be adequately fed (in terms of both calories and nutrition),\\\\nwithout having to eat items prepared with pork or pork by-products. \\\\n433 *433 16.  Until other programs for the useful and constructive occupation of the general population are instituted\\\\nor resumed, defendants shall undertake to provide inmates with all practicable means for mental diversion and/or\\\\nself-improvement while confined to their cells. \\\\nThis portion of the Court\\\\'s decree could be satisfied by offering inmates an opportunity to participate in \\\"cell\\\\nstudy\\\" programs, similar to those offered to invalid students in other state institutions. \\\\nOrder on Use of Chemical Agents\\\\n17.  The unjustified use of chemical agents against inmates is prohibited.  They shall not be used against\\\\nindividual inmates, or against small groups of them, except as authorized by the policy statement of the\\\\nOklahoma State Department of Corrections dated January 4, 1973.  To support the use of this form of physical\\\\nforce, the requirement of that policy statement that there be an actual and imminent threat of death or bodily\\\\n\\\\nharm must be present.  Chemical agents may also be used to quell an actual or incipient riot involving a large\\\\nnumber of unconfined inmates, where there is present an actual and imminent threat of death or bodily harm, or\\\\nan actual and imminent threat of serious damage to or the destruction of property which is substantial in quantity\\\\nand/or value.  They may also be used to thwart the imminent escape of an inmate or inmates. \\\\n18.  Whenever chemical agents are used against an inmate or inmates, all reasonable precautions shall be taken\\\\nto avoid or minimize inflicting the effects thereof on innocent inmates. \\\\n19.  Chemical agents shall not be used to enforce silence or otherwise to enforce the rules and regulations of the\\\\npenitentiary, unless the conditions set forth in paragraph 17 are present.  It will be an exceptional situation in\\\\nwhich the use of these agents can be justified against an inmate locked in his cell.  Even where a large number of\\\\ninmates locked in their cells are involved in a disturbance, chemical agents shall not be used if they are merely\\\\nnoisy, or shaking the doors of their cells (so long as the doors remain secure), or because of anything they may\\\\nsay to or shout at any member of the penitentiary staff.  These and similar rules infractions on the part of inmates\\\\nare properly dealt with by means of the penitentiary disciplinary system, with due process safeguards, rather than\\\\nsummarily. \\\\n20.  As is the case with any use of physical force against inmates, the use of chemical agents must never exceed\\\\nthat reasonably required to effect the legitimate ends of penitentiary officials.  Accordingly, the use of chemical\\\\nagents against inmates, on the rationale that the actual situation is one which could develop into 00 although it has\\\\n97\\\\nnot yet become 00 one in which the use of such agents is permitted, constitutes the excessive use of physical\\\\n97\\\\nforce and is prohibited both by the departmental policy statement of January 4, 1973, and by this Order. \\\\n21.  Every incident involving the use of any chemical agent against any one or more inmates shall be reported in\\\\nwriting by the warden to the director, with copies to all counsel of record in this case, within three days of the\\\\nincident until further order of the Court. A full and complete statement of all relevant circumstances shall be\\\\nincluded in such reports. If, in the opinion of the warden, further investigation is required, he shall denominate the\\\\nreport an interim report and shall submit a final report when the entire investigation is completed, but not less\\\\nthan ten days after the incident.  Any justified modification of the factual statement set forth in the interim report\\\\nshall be included in this final report. \\\\n22.  Within the parameters delineated by this Order, there remains great scope for the proper exercise of\\\\njudgment and sound discretion on the part of penitentiary officials.  The proper exercise of such judgment and\\\\n434 discretion should not be superseded by any Court and will not *434 be by this one.  The contrary proposition is\\\\nequally necessary, however; the unconstitutional use of chemical agents against inmates can neither be\\\\npermitted nor condoned.  What the Court has condemned in this Order is not the use of chemical agents in\\\\nsituations where the use of physical force against inmates is justified, but where reasonable men might differ on\\\\nthe kind or degree of necessary force.  The Court has condemned the use of chemical agents in situations where\\\\nthe use of any physical force is unjustified. \\\\nOrder on Medical Care\\\\n23.  Within 60 days from the date of this Order, the defendants shall formulate a comprehensive plan for providing\\\\nconstitutionally adequate routine and emergency medical care (including psychiatric care) to all inmates at the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary.  This plan shall be submitted to counsel for the plaintiffs and for the plaintiff-\\\\nintervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval. \\\\n24.  This plan shall include, but need not be limited to, the provisions necessary for the operation of an in-patient\\\\nmedical facility within the secured area of the penitentiary (or in such close proximity thereto that security\\\\nconsiderations will not unreasonably delay the receipt of needed medical care by inmates in the security area). \\\\nThis in-patient facility shall comply in its operating procedures, staffing, equipment and physical plant with the\\\\nregulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Health governing the licensure of hospitals and related\\\\ninstitutions, or with some other set of comprehensive standards generally accepted within the medical profession. \\\\nThe staffing provisions of the plan shall provide as a minimum:\\\\n\\\\na. nursing care 24 hours a day, seven days a week;\\\\nb. a full-time Chief Medical Officer;\\\\nc. the equivalent of one additional full-time doctor;\\\\nd. an adequate support staff of qualified generalist or specialist medical para-professionals;\\\\ne. such additional dental and dental support staff as will bring dental care in the penitentiary\\\\nsystem to an acceptable level; and\\\\nf. a designated staff member to be responsible for insuring that adequate in-patient psychiatric\\\\ncare and treatment are provided. \\\\nThe plan shall also specify the extent to which medical facilities and personnel outside the penitentiary system\\\\nare being relied upon to provide medical care for inmates and the specific means by which such outside care will\\\\nbe secured.  Also included will be appropriate provisions pertaining to the control, storage, handling and\\\\ndistribution of all medications. \\\\n25.  Pending the formulation, approval and implementation of such plan, the defendants shall insure that each\\\\ninmate who goes on sick call is seen by a medical doctor or by a fully-qualified health para-professional (e. g.,\\\\nphysician\\\\'s assistant, medical technician, etc.).  No individual member of the staff or inmate population who is not\\\\na fully-qualified health professional or para-professional shall inhibit, prevent or obstruct any inmate from going\\\\non sick call.\\\\nOrder on Correspondence and Publications\\\\n26.  The confidentiality of any inmate\\\\'s outgoing correspondence to any attorney, court, or government official or\\\\nagency shall not be abridged.  This provision is specifically applicable to mail to be sent to any court which is\\\\nrequired by that court to be notarized.  Incoming correspondence from any of these sources may be opened and\\\\ninspected for contraband, but only in the presence of the inmate-addressee, and may not be delayed or read. \\\\n435 27.  With respect to all other correspondence to and from inmates of the *435 penitentiary system, the Court has\\\\npreviously noted with approval the recent, significant improvement in defendants\\\\' policies.  Within 60 days from\\\\nthe date of this decree, defendants shall submit whatever modifications of their existing policies, specific\\\\npractices or operating procedures in this area are deemed by them to be required or warranted in the light of the\\\\nprovisions of Conclusions of Law 29-31, inclusive, supra, or the recent decision of the United States Supreme\\\\nCourt in the case of Procunier v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974).  Such shall be\\\\nsubmitted, together with a written presentation of their unmodified policies, practices and operating procedures in\\\\nthe form of a single, proposed comprehensive regulation for consideration and approval by the Court. Copies of\\\\nthis submission shall also be sent to counsel for the plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment.  No inmate,\\\\nwhether enjoying unrestricted or restricted correspondence status under defendants\\\\' existing policy statement,\\\\nshall be subjected to any arbitrary limitations on the number of approved correspondents, the identity thereof, etc.\\\\n28.  With respect to general circulation publications, such as newspapers and magazines, a comprehensive\\\\nregulation, consistent with all aspects of Conclusion of Law 32, supra, shall be submitted within 60 days from the\\\\ndate of this decree, to counsel for the plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for\\\\nconsideration and approval.  This plan shall include all of the necessary and reasonable rules with which an\\\\ninmate must comply in order to subscribe to any such general circulation publication.  It shall also include those\\\\ndetailed internal operating procedures necessary to insure that any present, continuing effects of past arbitrary\\\\nand capricious practices in this area are overcome. \\\\n29.  No decision shall be made to exclude any publication except as may be required by the needs of security,\\\\ngood order, or rehabilitation; nor shall any such decision be made by any penitentiary official other than the\\\\nWarden or Deputy Warden, and then only after full compliance with the applicable provisions of Conclusion of\\\\nLaw 32, supra, regarding notice, opportunity to submit additional facts, etc. Any decision to exclude shall be\\\\n\\\\nmade solely on the basis of the content of the specific publication in question and the official actually making the\\\\ndecision shall prepare and retain on file a detailed statement of the specific basis for each such exclusion. \\\\nOrder on Access to the Courts\\\\n30.  Within 60 days from the date of this Order, the defendants shall prepare and submit to counsel for the plaintiff\\\\nand plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval, a comprehensive plan for\\\\ninsuring that inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary have adequate and effective access to the Courts.  The\\\\nplan shall consider and address the problem of reasonable access in terms of habeas corpus petitions, \\u00a7 1983\\\\nand other civil rights matters, out-of-time appeals, and such other matters as are addressed more particularly in\\\\nthe Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, supra. In order to insure that effective access is available\\\\nthroughout the penitentiary system, appropriate consideration shall be given to the number of inmates in the\\\\npenitentiary system, the fact of their geographic dispersion, the anticipated number of requests for post-\\\\nconviction legal assistance, and the educational level of the overall inmate population. \\\\n31.  Pending the information, approval and implementation of such a plan, the defendants shall forthwith refrain\\\\nfrom interfering with the acquisition or possession by inmates of legal materials, including transcripts, lawbooks,\\\\nlegal periodicals, paper, etc. They shall also arrange for capable and experienced inmates to be allowed to help\\\\n436 those who require assistance in order to be able effectively to frame and present legal issues *436 and relevant\\\\nfacts for judicial consideration. \\\\n32.  The defendants shall forthwith advise all inmates that they are permitted to subscribe to any legal periodical\\\\nand to seek to obtain lawbooks and legal assistance by mail.  The defendants shall insure that the inmates\\\\nunderstand that they are permitted to purchase and possess legal periodicals and books specifically dealing with\\\\nthe legal problems of inmates and that they are authorized to write to organizations concentrating on such\\\\nproblems in an effort to obtain legal assistance, reference materials, etc.\\\\nOrder on Religious Freedom\\\\n33.  Defendants shall forthwith cease all unreasonable interference with the provision to inmates of spiritual\\\\ncounselling and the opportunity to engage in group religious services. \\\\n34.  Defendant shall forthwith advise all inmates of the penitentiary system that they may subscribe to and receive\\\\nreligious publications, including books, newspapers and magazines, unless any such publication demonstrably\\\\npresents a threat to security, discipline and good order within the institution that cannot otherwise be overcome. \\\\nMuslim inmates shall forthwith be advised specifically that the above authority to subscribe to and receive\\\\nreligious publications extends to the publications entitled \\\"Message to the Black Man\\\" and \\\"Muhammad Speaks.\\\" They shall also be advised of every food item served to the inmates of the penitentiary that is known or believed\\\\nby the defendants to contain pork or pork by-products. \\\\n35.  Within 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall advise the Court, in writing, with copies to\\\\ncounsel for plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor, of the progress to date and of all future plans for providing religious\\\\ncounselling and group services, and of the fact of compliance with the remaining provisions of this portion of the\\\\nCourt\\\\'s decree. \\\\nOrder on Security and Staffing\\\\n36.  The Court has found that there were and are serious deficiencies in the level of overall security within the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary.  In different ways, this involves the security of the institution itself, the personal\\\\nsecurity of the members of the staff and the inmates who, as wards of the state, are entitled to and indeed must\\\\nlook to the state to reasonably insure their safety.  The Court has further found that these security deficiencies are\\\\nin large measure due to both a serious shortage of staff at the penitentiary and to a very high turnover among\\\\nstaff members.  Many of the unconstitutional conditions and practices that exist at the pentitentiary (or which\\\\n\\\\nexisted in the recent past and have present continuing effects) cannot be corrected without a considerable\\\\nimprovement in these areas of security and staffing. \\\\n37.  Accordingly, counsel for the defendants shall, within 60 days of the date of this Order, submit to counsel for\\\\nthe plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval, a plan for\\\\neffecting promptly all necessary improvement in the areas of security and staffing. \\\\n38.  In the interim, the defendants are advised that alleged shortages of staff shall not be deemed to constitute an\\\\nacceptable reason for the failure to comply fully with any provision of this decree.', ' Defendants shall forthwith cease all unreasonable interference with the provision to inmates of spiritual\\\\ncounselling and the opportunity to engage in group religious services. \\\\n34.  Defendant shall forthwith advise all inmates of the penitentiary system that they may subscribe to and receive\\\\nreligious publications, including books, newspapers and magazines, unless any such publication demonstrably\\\\npresents a threat to security, discipline and good order within the institution that cannot otherwise be overcome. \\\\nMuslim inmates shall forthwith be advised specifically that the above authority to subscribe to and receive\\\\nreligious publications extends to the publications entitled \\\"Message to the Black Man\\\" and \\\"Muhammad Speaks.\\\" They shall also be advised of every food item served to the inmates of the penitentiary that is known or believed\\\\nby the defendants to contain pork or pork by-products. \\\\n35.  Within 60 days of the date of this decree, the defendants shall advise the Court, in writing, with copies to\\\\ncounsel for plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor, of the progress to date and of all future plans for providing religious\\\\ncounselling and group services, and of the fact of compliance with the remaining provisions of this portion of the\\\\nCourt\\\\'s decree. \\\\nOrder on Security and Staffing\\\\n36.  The Court has found that there were and are serious deficiencies in the level of overall security within the\\\\nOklahoma State Penitentiary.  In different ways, this involves the security of the institution itself, the personal\\\\nsecurity of the members of the staff and the inmates who, as wards of the state, are entitled to and indeed must\\\\nlook to the state to reasonably insure their safety.  The Court has further found that these security deficiencies are\\\\nin large measure due to both a serious shortage of staff at the penitentiary and to a very high turnover among\\\\nstaff members.  Many of the unconstitutional conditions and practices that exist at the pentitentiary (or which\\\\n\\\\nexisted in the recent past and have present continuing effects) cannot be corrected without a considerable\\\\nimprovement in these areas of security and staffing. \\\\n37.  Accordingly, counsel for the defendants shall, within 60 days of the date of this Order, submit to counsel for\\\\nthe plaintiffs and the plaintiff-intervenor for comment, and to the Court for consideration and approval, a plan for\\\\neffecting promptly all necessary improvement in the areas of security and staffing. \\\\n38.  In the interim, the defendants are advised that alleged shortages of staff shall not be deemed to constitute an\\\\nacceptable reason for the failure to comply fully with any provision of this decree.
