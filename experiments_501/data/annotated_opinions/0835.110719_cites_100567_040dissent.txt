 See also Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., 436 U. S. 307, 323 (1978); United States v. United States District Court, supra, at 321.  The safeguards embodied in the warrant requirement apply as forcefully to automobile searches as to any others.  Our cases do recognize a narrow exception to the warrant requirement for certain automobile searches.  Throughout our decisions, two major considerations have been advanced to justify the automobile exception to the warrant require *830 ment.  We have upheld only those searches that are actually justified by those considerations.  First, these searches have been justified on the basis of the exigency of the mobility of the automobile.  See, e. g., Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 (1970); Carroll v. United States, <citedDecision>267 U. S. 132</citedDecision> (1925).  This “mobility” rationale is something of a misnomer, cf. Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U. S. 433, 442-443 (1973), since the police ordinarily can remove the car’s occupants and secure the vehicle on the spot. However, the inherent mobility of the vehicle often creates situations in which the police’s only alternative to an immediate search may be to release the automobile from their possession.  2 This alternative creates an unacceptably high risk of losing the contents of the vehicle, and is a principal basis for the Court’s automobile exception to the warrant requirement.  See Chambers, supra, at 51, n. 9 .  In many cases, however, the police will, prior to searching the car, have cause to arrest the occupants and bring them to the station for booking.  In this situation, the police can ordinarily seize the automobile and bring it to the station.  Because the vehicle is now in the exclusive control of the authorities, any subsequent search cannot be justified by the mobility of the car. Rather, an immediate warrantless search of the vehicle is permitted because of the second major justification for the automobile exception: the diminished expectation of privacy in an automobile.

 The lesser-expectation-of-privacy rationale also has little force.  A container, as opposed to the car itself, does not reflect diminished privacy interests.  See id., at 762, 764-765 .  Moreover, the practical corollary that this Court has recognized — that depriving occupants of the use of a car may be a greater intrusion than an immediate search — is of doubtful relevance here, since the owner of a container will rarely suffer significant inconvenience by being deprived of its use while a warrant is being obtained.  Ultimately, the majority, unable to rely on the justifications underlying the automobile exception, simply creates a new “probable cause” exception to the warrant requirement for automobiles.  We have soundly rejected attempts to create such an exception in the past, see Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971), and we should do so again today.  In purported reliance on <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, the Court defines the permissible scope of a search by reference to the scope of a probable-cause search that a magistrate could authorize.  Under <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> , however, the mobility of an automobile is what is critical to the legality of a warrantless search.  Of course, <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> properly confined the search to the probable-cause limits that would also limit a magistrate, but it did not suggest that the search could be as broad as a magistrate could authorize upon a warrant.  A magistrate could authorize a search encompassing containers, even though the mobility rationale does not justify such a broad search.  Indeed, the Court’s reasoning might have justified the search of the entire car in Coolidge despite the fact that the car was not “mobile” at all. Thus, in blithely suggesting that <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> “neither broadened nor limited the scope of a lawful search based on probable cause,” *833 ante, at 820, the majority assumes what has never been the law: that the scope of the automobile-mobility exception to the warrant requirement is as broad as the scope of a “lawful” probable-cause search of an automobile, i.  e., one authorized by a magistrate.  The majority’s sleight-of-hand ignores the obvious differences between the function served by a magistrate in making a determination of probable cause and the function of the automobile exception.  It is irrelevant to a magistrate’s function whether the items subject to search are mobile, may be in danger of destruction, or are impractical to store, or whether an immediate search would be less intrusive than a seizure without a warrant.  A magistrate’s only concern is whether there is probable cause to search them.  Where suspicion has focused not on a particular item but only on a vehicle, home, or office, the magistrate might reasonably authorize a search of closed containers at the location as well.  But an officer on the beat who searches an automobile without a warrant is not entitled to conduct a broader search than the exigency obviating the warrant justifies.

 See Sanders, 442 U. S., at 763-765 , and n. 13; Chadwick, supra, at 17, n. 1 (Brennan, J., concurring).  Chadwick , as the majority notes, “reaffirmed the general principle that closed packages and containers may not be *835 searched without a warrant.” Ante, at 812.  Although there is no need to describe the exact contours of that protection in this dissenting opinion, it is clear enough that closed, opaque containers — regardless of whether they are “worthy” or are always used to store personal items — are ordinarily fully protected.  Cf. Sanders, supra, at 764, n. 13 .  4 Here, because respondent Ross had placed the evidence in question in a closed paper bag, the container could be seized, but not searched, without a warrant.  No practical exigencies required the warrantless searches on the street or at the station: Ross had been arrested and was in custody when both searches occurred, and the police succeeded in transporting the bag to the station without inadvertently spilling its contents.  5 II In announcing its new rule, the Court purports to rely on earlier automobile search cases, especially <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> v. United States.  The Court’s approach, however, far from being “faithful to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that the Court has followed with substantial consistency throughout our history,” ante, at 824, is plainly contrary to the letter and the spirit of our prior automobile search cases. Moreover, the new rule produces anomalous and unacceptable consequences.  *836 A The majority’s argument that its decision is supported by our decisions in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> and Chambers is misplaced.  The Court in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> upheld a warrantless search of an automobile for contraband on the basis of the impracticability of securing a warrant in cases involving the transportation of contraband goods.  The Court did not, however, suggest that obtaining a warrant for the search of an automobile is always impracticable.  6 “In cases where the securing of a warrant is reasonably practicable, it must be used .... In cases where seizure is impossible except without warrant, the seizing officer acts unlawfully and at his peril unless he can show the court probable cause.” <citedDecision>267 U. S., at 156</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  7 As this Court reaffirmed in Chambers, 399 U. S., *837 at 50 , “[n]either <citedDecision>Carroll, supra,</citedDecision> nor other cases in this Court require or suggest that in every conceivable circumstance the search of an auto even with probable cause may be made without the extra protection for privacy that a warrant affords.” Notwithstanding the reasoning of these cases, the majority argues that <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> and Chambers support its decisions because integral compartments of a car are functionally equivalent to containers found within a car, and because the practical advantages to the police of the <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> doctrine “would be largely nullified if the permissible scope of a warrantless search of an automobile did not include containers and packages found inside the vehicle.” Ante, at 820.  Neither of these arguments is persuasive.  First, the Court’s argument that allowing warrantless searches of certain integral compartments of the car in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> and Chambers, while protecting movable containers within the car, would be “illogical” and “absurd,” ante, at 818, ignores the reason why this Court has allowed warrantless searches of automobile compartments.  Surely an integral compartment within a car is just as mobile, and presents the same practical problems of safekeeping, as the car itself.  This cannot be said of movable containers located within the car. The fact that there may be a high expectation of privacy in both containers and compartments is irrelevant, since the privacy rationale is not, and cannot be, the justification for the warrantless search of compartments.  The Court’s second argument, which focuses on the practical advantages to police of the <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> doctrine, fares no better.  The practical considerations which concerned the <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> Court involved the difficulty of immobilizing a vehicle while a warrant must be obtained.  The Court had no occasion to address whether containers present the same practical difficulties as the car itself or integral compartments of the car. They do not.  See supra, at 832.  <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> hardly suggested, as the Court implies, ante, at 820, that a warrant- *838 less search is justified simply because it assists police in obtaining more evidence.  Although it can find no support for its rule in this Court’s precedents or in the traditional justifications for the automobile exception, the majority offers another justification.  In a footnote, the majority suggests that “practical considerations” militate against securing containers found during an automobile search and taking them to the magistrate.  Ante, at 821, n. 28.  The Court confidently remarks: “[Pjrohibiting police from opening immediately a container in which the object of the search is most likely to be found and instead forcing them first to comb the entire vehicle would actually exacerbate the intrusion on privacy interests.  Moreover, until the container itself was opened the police could never be certain that the contraband was not secreted in a yet undiscovered portion of the vehicle.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> The vehicle would have to be seized while a warrant was obtained, a requirement inconsistent with <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> and Chambers.  Ante, at 821, n. 28.  This explanation is unpersuasive.  As this Court explained in Sanders and as the majority today implicitly concedes, the burden to police departments of seizing a package or personal luggage simply does not compare to the burden of seizing and safeguarding automobiles.  Sanders, 442 U. S., at 765, n. 14 ; ante, at 811, and n. 16.  Other aspects of the Court’s explanation are also implausible.  The search will not always require a “combing” of the entire vehicle, since police may be looking for a particular item and may discover it promptly.
