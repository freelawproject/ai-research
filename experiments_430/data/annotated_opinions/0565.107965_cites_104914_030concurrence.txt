**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Black, concurring.  I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in this case that the “clear and present danger” doctrine should have no place *450 in the interpretation of the First Amendment.  I join the Court’s opinion, which, as I understand it, simply cites Dennis v. United States, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 494</citedDecision> (1951), but does not indicate any agreement on the Court’s part with the “clear and present danger” doctrine on which <citedDecision>Dennis</citedDecision> purported to rely.
