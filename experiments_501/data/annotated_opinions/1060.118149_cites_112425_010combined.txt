 The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.  93 F. 3d 1358 (1996).  The court first noted that the agreement between respondents and State Oil did indeed fix maximum gasoline prices by making it “worthless” for respondents to exceed the suggested retail prices.  Id., at 1360 .  After reviewing legal and economic aspects of price fixing, the court concluded'that State Oil’s pricing scheme was a per se antitrust violation under Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra. Although the Court of Appeals characterized Albrecht as “unsound when decided” and “inconsistent with later decisions” of this Court, it felt constrained to follow that decision.  93 F. 3d, at 1363 .  In light of Albrecht and Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., <citedDecision>495 U. S. 328</citedDecision> (1990) (ARCO), the court found that respondents could have suffered antitrust injury from not being able to adjust gasoline prices.  We granted certiorari to consider two questions, whether State Oil’s conduct constitutes a per se violation of the Sherman Act and whether respondents are entitled to recover damages based on that conduct.  519 U. S. 1107 (1997).  *10 II A Although the Sherman Act, by its terms, prohibits every agreement “in restraint of trade,” this Court has long recognized that Congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints.  See, e. g., Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 342-343 (1982) (citing United States v. Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U. S. 505 (1898)).  As a consequence, most antitrust claims are analyzed under a “rule of reason,” according to which the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition, taking into account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, and the restraint’s history, nature, and effect.  457 U. S., at 343 , and n. 13 (citing Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U. S. 231, 238 (1918)).

 Prob. 506 (1965)).  The Court concluded that, because “departure from the rule-of-reason standard must be based upon demonstrable economic effect rather than — as in Schwinn — upon formalistic line drawing,” the appropriate course would be “to return to the rule of reason that governed vertical restrictions prior to Schwinn.” GTE Sylvania, supra, at 58-59.  In GTE Sylvania, the Court declined to comment on Albrechts per se treatment of vertical maximum price restrictions, noting that the issue “involve[d] significantly different questions of analysis and policy.” 483 U. S., at 51, n. 18.  Subsequent decisions of the Court, however, have hinted that the analytical underpinnings of Albrecht were substantially weakened by GTE Sylvania.  We noted in Mari-copa County that vertical restraints are generally more defensible than horizontal restraints.  See 457 U. S., at 348, n. 18 .  And we explained in 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U. S. 335, 341-342 (1987), that decisions such as GTE Sylvania “recognize the possibility that a vertical restraint imposed by a single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand competition.” Most recently, in ARCO, <citedDecision>495 U. S. 328</citedDecision> (1990), although Al-brecht’s continuing validity was not squarely before the Court, some disfavor with that decision was signaled by our statement that we would “assume, arguendo, that Albrecht correctly held that vertical, maximum price fixing is subject to the per se rule.” <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 335, n. 5</citedDecision> .  More significantly, we specifically acknowledged that vertical maximum price fixing “may have procompetitive interbrand effects,” and pointed out that, in the wake of GTE Sylvania, “[t]he *15 proeompetitive potential of a vertical maximum price restraint is more evident.  .  .  than it was when Albrecht was decided, because exclusive territorial arrangements and other nonprice restrictions were unlawful per se in 1968.” <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 348</citedDecision> , n. 13 (citing several commentators identifying proeompetitive effects of vertical maximum price fixing, including, e. g., P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 340.30b, p. 378, n. 24 (1988 Supp.); Blair & Harrison, Rethinking Antitrust Injury, 42 Vand. L. Rev. 1539 , 1553 (1989); Easterbrook, Maximum Price Fixing, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 886 , 887-890 (1981)) (hereinafter Easterbrook).  B Thus, our reconsideration of Albrecht’s continuing validity is informed by several of our decisions, as well as a considerable body of scholarship discussing the effects of vertical restraints.  Our analysis is also guided by our general view that the primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect interbrand competition.  See, e. g., Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U. S. 717, 726 (1988).  “Low prices,” we have explained, “benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and so long as they are above predatory levels, they do not threaten competition.” ARCO, supra, at 340.  Our interpretation of the Sherman Act also incorporates the notion that condemnation of practices resulting in lower prices to consumers is “especially costly” because “cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition.” Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574, 594 (1986).  So informed, we find it difficult to maintain that vertically imposed maximum prices could harm consumers or competition to the extent necessary to justify their per se invalidation.

 In response, as one commentator has pointed out, “the ban on maximum resale price limitations declared in Albrecht in the name of ‘dealer freedom’ has actually prompted many suppliers to integrate forward into distribution, thus eliminating the very independent trader for whom Albrecht professed solicitude.” *17 8 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law ¶ 1635, p. 395 (1989) (hereinafter Areeda).  For example, integration in the newspaper industry since Albrecht has given rise to litigation between independent distributors and publishers.  See P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 729.7, pp. 599-614 (1996 Supp.).  The Albrecht Court also expressed the concern that maximum prices may be set too low for dealers to offer consumers essential or desired services.  390 U. S., at 152-153 .  But such conduct, by driving away customers, would seem likely to harm manufacturers as well as dealers and consumers, making it unlikely that a supplier would set such a price as a matter of business judgment.  See, e. g., Lopatka, Stephen Breyer and Modern Antitrust: A Snug Fit, 40 Antitrust Bull. 1, 60 (1995); Blair & Lang, Albrecht After <citedDecision>ARCO</citedDecision> : Maximum Resale Price Fixing Moves Toward the Rule of Reason, 44 Vand. L. Rev. 1007 , 1034 (1991).  In addition, Albrecht noted that vertical maximum price fixing could effectively channel distribution through large or specially advantaged dealers.  390 U. S., at 153 .  It is unclear, however, that a supplier would profit from limiting its market by excluding potential dealers.  See, e. g., Easterbrook 905-908.  Further, although vertical maximum price fixing might limit the viability of inefficient dealers, that consequence is not necessarily harmful to competition and consumers.  See, e. g., id., at 907; Lopatka, supra, at 60.  Finally, Albrecht reflected the Court’s fear that maximum price fixing could be used to disguise arrangements to fix minimum prices, 390 U. S., at 153 , which remain illegal per se. Although we have acknowledged the possibility that maximum pricing might mask minimum pricing, see Maricopa County, 457 U. S., at 348 , we believe that such conduct — as with the other concerns articulated in Albrecht— can be appropriately recognized and punished under the rule of reason.  See, e. g., Easterbrook 901-904; see also Pitofsky, In Defense of Discounters: The No-Frills Case for a Per Se *18 Rule Against Vertical Price Fixing, 71 Geo. L. J. 1487, 1490, n. 17 (1983).  Not only are the potential injuries cited in Albrecht less serious than the Court imagined, the per se rule established therein could in fact exacerbate problems related to the unrestrained exercise of market power by monopolist-dealers.  Indeed, both courts and antitrust scholars have noted that Albrecht’s rule may actually harm consumers and manufacturers.  See, e. g., Caribe BMW, Inc. v. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, 19 F. 3d 745, 753 (CA1 1994) (Breyer, C. J.); Areeda ¶ 1636a, at 395; G. Mathewson & R. Winter, Competition Policy and Vertical Exchange 13-14 (1985).  Other commentators have also explained that Al-brecht’s per se rule has even more potential for deleterious effect on competition after our decision in GTE Sylvania, because, now that vertical nonprice restrictions are not unlawful per se, the likelihood of dealer monopoly power is increased.  See, e. g., Easterbrook 890, n. 20; see also ARCO, <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 343, n. 13</citedDecision> .  We do not intend to suggest that dealers generally possess sufficient market power to exploit a monopoly situation.  Such retail market power may in fact be uncommon.  See, e. g., Business Electronics, 485 U. S., at 727, n. 2 ; GTE Sylvania, 433 U. S., at 54.  Nor do we hold that a ban on vertical maximum price fixing inevitably has anticompetitive consequences in the exclusive dealer context.  After reconsidering Albrecht’s rationale and the substantial criticism the decision has received, however, we conclude that there is insufficient economic justification for per se invalidation of vertical maximum price fixing.  That is so not only because it is difficult to accept the assumptions underlying Albrecht , but also because Albrecht has little or no relevance to ongoing enforcement of the Sherman Act.

 See, e. g., Copperweld Corp., supra, at 777; GTE Sylvania, supra, at 47-49; cf. Tigner v. Texas, 310 U. S. 141, 147 (1940).  Although we do not “lightly assume that the economic realities underlying earlier decisions have changed, or that earlier judicial perceptions of those realities were in error,” we have noted that “different sorts of agreements” may amount to restraints of trade “in varying times and circumstances,” and “[i]t would make no sense to create out of the single term ‘restraint of trade’ a chronologically schizoid statute, in which a ‘rule of reason’ evolves with new circumstances and new wisdom, but a line of per se illegality remains forever fixed where it was.” Business Electronics, supra, at 731-732.  Just as Schwinn was “the subject of continuing controversy and confusion” under the “great weight” of scholarly criticism, GTE Sylvania, supra, at 47-48, Albrecht has been widely criticized since its inception.  With the views underlying Albrecht eroded by this Court’s precedent, there is not much of that decision to salvage.  See, e. g., Neal v. United States, 516 U. S. 284, 295 (1996); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 480-481 (1989).  Although the rule of Albrecht has been in effect for some time, the inquiry we must undertake requires considering “ ‘the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional *22 restraints in the American economy today.’” GTE Sylvania, supra, at 53, n. 21 (quoting Schwinn, 388 U. S., at 392 (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  As the Court noted in ARCO, <citedDecision>495 U. S., at 336, n. 6</citedDecision> , there has not been another ease since Albrecht in which this Court has “confronted an unadulterated vertical, maximum-price-fixing arrangement.” Now that we confront Albrecht directly, we find its conceptual foundations gravely weakened.  In overruling Albrecht , we of course do not hold that all vertical maximum price fixing is per se lawful.  Instead, vertical maximum priee fixing, like the majority of commercial arrangements subject-to the antitrust laws, should be evaluated under the rule of reason.  In our view, rule-of-reason analysis will effectively identify those situations in which vertical maximum price fixing amounts to anticompetitive conduct.  There remains the question whether respondents are entitled to recover damages based on State Oil’s conduct.  Although the Court of Appeals noted that “the district judge was right to conclude that if the rule of reason is applicable, Khan loses,” 93 F. 3d, at 1362 , its consideration of this case was necessarily premised on Albrecht's per se rule.  Under the circumstances, the matter should be reviewed by the Court of Appeals in the first instance.
