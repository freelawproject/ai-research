<p id="b297-8">I would be content to decide this ease on the authority of <em>House </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>324 U. S. 42 (1945) <em>(per curiam), </em>that common-law certiorari is available to review the denial of the certificate, leaving <em>House’s </em>precarious future for another day when its precedential value might have to be faced squarely. But that course would command no more than a minority of one, and there is good reason to deny it even that support. <em>House’s </em>holding on what may be “ fin’ the court of appeals,” <em>id., </em>at 44, was virtually unreasoned, and the Court correctly notes our subsequent practice of honoring this rule in the breach. Given the weakness of the precedent, the <page-number citation-index="1" label="254">*254</page-number>advantage of having a clear majority for a rule governing our jurisdiction to reverse erroneous denials of certificates of appealability persuades me to join the others in overruling <em>House </em>insofar as it would bear on issuance of a statutory writ of certiorari under 28 U. S. C. § 1254(1).</p>
