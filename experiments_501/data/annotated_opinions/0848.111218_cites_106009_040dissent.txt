 This not only reduces the diverse directions in which economic power is aimed but suddenly increases the economic power moving in one particular direction.” Ante, at 769.  That is true, but it is also true of any ordinary commercial contract between separate entities, as can be seen if one substitutes the word “contract” for “conspiracy” in the passage I have quoted.  The language of the Sherman Act indicates that it treats “contracts” and “conspiracies” as equivalent concepts — both satisfy the multiplicity-of-aetors requirement — and yet one of the most fundamental points in antitrust jurisprudence, dating at least to Standard Oil, is that there is nothing inherently anticompetitive about a contract.  Similarly, an agreement to act “for common benefit” in itself is unremarkable — all agreements are in some sense a restraint of trade be they contracts or conspiracies.  It is only when trade is unreasonably restrained that § 1 is implicated.  The Court’s evidentiary concern lacks merit.  We made this point in the context of resale price maintenance in United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., <citedDecision>362 U. S. 29</citedDecision> (1960): “The Sherman Act forbids combinations of traders to suppress competition.  True, there results the same economic effect as is accomplished by a prohibited combination to suppress price competition if each customer, although induced to do so solely by a manufacturer’s announced policy, independently decides to observe specified resale prices.  So long as Colgate is not overruled, this result is tolerated but only when it is the consequence of a mere refusal to sell in the exercise of a manufacturer’s right ‘freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.’” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 44 (quoting Colgate, 250 U. S., at 307 ).  “[lit is the potential which this conspiracy concept holds for the development of a rational enforcement policy which, if anything, will ultimately attract the courts.  If conduct of a single corporation which restrains trade were to violate Section 1, a forceful weapon would be available to the government with which to challenge conduct which in oligopolistic industries creates or reinforces entry barriers.  Excessive advertising in the cereal, drug, or detergent industries, annual style changes in the auto industry, and other such practices could be reached as soon as they threatened to inhibit competition; there would be no need to wait until a ‘dangerous probability’ of monopoly had been reached, the requirement under Section 2 ‘attempt’ doctrine.  Nor would a single firm restraint of trade rule be overbroad.  It would in no way threaten single firm activity — setting a price, deciding what market it would deal in, or the like — which did not threaten competitive conditions.” L. Sullivan, swpra n. 9, § 114, at 324 (footnotes omitted).  This was the case in Kiefer-Stewart, for example.
