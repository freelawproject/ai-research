 [6] See, e. g., Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397 U. S. 620, 631 (1970) (rejecting argument that language in Treaty had special meaning when United States was competent to state that meaning more clearly).  The State argues that despite any explicit reference to the 1837 Treaty rights, or to usufructuary rights more generally, the second sentence of Article 1 nevertheless abrogates those rights.  But to determine whether this language abrogates Chippewa Treaty rights, we look beyond the written words to the larger context that frames the Treaty, including "the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties." Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U. S. 423, 432 (1943); see also El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S. 155, 167 (1999).  In this case, an examination of the historical record provides insight into how the parties to the Treaty understood the terms of the agreement.  This insight is especially helpful to the extent that it sheds light on how the Chippewa signatories to the Treaty understood the agreement because we interpret Indian treaties to give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood them.  See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S. 658, 675-676</citedDecision> (1979); United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 380-381 (1905).  The 1855 Treaty was designed primarily to transfer Chippewa land to the United States, not to terminate Chippewa usufructuary rights.  It was negotiated under the authority of the Act of December 19, 1854.  This Act authorized treaty *197 negotiations with the Chippewa "for the extinguishment of their title to all the lands owned and claimed by them in the Territory of Minnesota and State of Wisconsin." Ch. 7, 10 Stat. 598 .  The Act is silent with respect to authorizing agreements to terminate Indian usufructuary privileges, and this silence was likely not accidental.  During Senate debate on the Act, Senator Sebastian, the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, stated that the treaties to be negotiated under the Act would "reserv[e] to them [ i.
**Combined Opinion**
 If the United States had intended to abrogate Chippewa usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty, it almost certainly would have included a provision to that effect in the 1854 Treaty, yet that Treaty contains no such provision.  To the contrary, it expressly secures new usufructuary rights to the signatory Bands on the newly ceded territory.  The State proposes no explanation compelling or otherwisefor why the United States would have wanted to abrogate the Mille Lacs Band's hunting and fishing rights, while leaving intact the other Bands' rights to hunt and fish on the same territory.  *200 To summarize, the historical record provides no support for the theory that the second sentence of Article 1 was designed to abrogate the usufructuary privileges guaranteed under the 1837 Treaty, but it does support the theory that the Treaty, and Article 1 in particular, was designed to transfer Chippewa land to the United States.  At the very least, the historical record refutes the State's assertion that the 1855 Treaty "unambiguously" abrogated the 1837 hunting, fishing, and gathering privileges.  Given this plausible ambiguity, we cannot agree with the State that the 1855 Treaty abrogated Chippewa usufructuary rights.  We have held that Indian treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the Indians, <citedDecision>Washington</citedDecision> v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S., at 675-676</citedDecision> ; Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U. S., at 432 , and that any ambiguities are to be resolved in their favor, Winters v. United States, 207 U. S. 564, 576-577 (1908).  See also County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992).  To attack the conclusion that the 1855 Treaty does not abrogate the usufructuary rights guaranteed under the 1837 Treaty, the State relies primarily on our decision in Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985).  Klamath required this Court to interpret two agreements.  In the first agreement, an 1864 Treaty between the United States and several Indian Tribes now collectively known as the Klamath Indian Tribe, the Indians conveyed their remaining lands to the United States, and a portion of this land was set aside as a reservation.  Id., at 755 .  The 1864 Treaty provided that the Tribe had the "`exclusive right of taking fish in the streams and lakes, included in said reservation, and of gathering edible roots, seeds, and berries within its limits,' " but it provided for no offreservation usufructuary rights.

 Rather, to reach our conclusion about the meaning of that language, we examined the historical record and considered the context of the treaty negotiations to discern what the parties intended by their choice of words.  This review of the history and the negotiations of the agreements is central to the interpretation of treaties.  El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S., at 167 .  As we described above, an analysis of the history, purpose, and negotiations of this Treaty leads us to conclude that the Mille Lacs Band did not relinquish their 1837 Treaty rights in the 1855 Treaty.  IV Finally, the State argues that the Chippewa's usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty were extinguished when Minnesota was admitted to the Union in 1858.  In making this argument, the State faces an uphill battle.  Congress may abrogate Indian treaty rights, but it must clearly express its intent to do so. United States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734, 738-740 (1986); see also <citedDecision>Washington</citedDecision> v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S., at 690</citedDecision> ; Menominee Tribe v. United States, 391 U. S. 404, 413 (1968).  There must be "clear evidence that Congress actually considered the conflict between its intended action on the one hand and Indian treaty rights on the other, and chose *203 to resolve that conflict by abrogating the treaty." United States v. Dion, supra, at 740 .  There is no such "clear evidence" of congressional intent to abrogate the Chippewa Treaty rights here.  The relevant statuteMinnesota's enabling Actprovides in relevant part: "[T]he State of Minnesota shall be one, and is hereby declared to be one, of the United States of America, and admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever." Act of May 11, 1858, 11 Stat. 285 .  This language, like the rest of the Act, makes no mention of Indian treaty rights; it provides no clue that Congress considered the reserved rights of the Chippewa and decided to abrogate those rights when it passed the Act.

 As relevant here, it prevents the Federal Government from impairing *204 fundamental attributes of state sovereignty when it admits new States into the Union.  Id., at 573 .  According to the Race Horse Court, because the treaty rights conflicted irreconcilably with state regulation of natural resources "an essential attribute of its governmental existence," 163 U. S., at 516the treaty rights were held an invalid impairment of Wyoming's sovereignty.  Thus, those rights could not survive Wyoming's admission to the Union on "equal footing" with the original States.  But Race Horse rested on a false premise.  As this Court's subsequent cases have made clear, an Indian tribe's treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on state land are not irreconcilable with a State's sovereignty over the natural resources in the State.  See, e. g., <citedDecision>Washington</citedDecision> v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel <citedDecision>Assn., supra</citedDecision> ; see also Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194 (1975).  Rather, Indian treaty rights can coexist with state management of natural resources.  Although States have important interests in regulating wildlife and natural resources within their borders, this authority is shared with the Federal Government when the Federal Government exercises one of its enumerated constitutional powers, such as treaty making.  U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  See, e. g., Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920); Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529 (1976); United States v. Winans, 198 U. S., at 382-384 ; United States v. Forty-three Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U. S. 188 (1876).  See also Menominee Tribe v. United States, supra, at 411, n. 12.  Here, the 1837 Treaty gave the Chippewa the right to hunt, fish, and gather in the ceded territory free of territorial, and later state, regulation, a privilege that others did not enjoy.  Today, this freedom from state regulation curtails the State's ability to regulate hunting, fishing, and gathering by the Chippewa in the ceded lands.  But this Court's cases have also recognized that Indian treaty-based usufructuary rights do not guarantee the Indians "absolute freedom" from state regulation.  Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath *205 Tribe, 473 U. S., at 765, n. 16 .  We have repeatedly reaffirmed state authority to impose reasonable and necessary nondiscriminatory regulations on Indian hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in the interest of conservation.  See Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 391 U. S. 392, 398 (1968); Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S., at 682</citedDecision> ; Antoine v. Washington, supra, at 207-208.  This "conservation necessity" standard accommodates both the State's interest in management of its natural resources and the Chippewa's federally guaranteed treaty rights.  Thus, because treaty rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land within state boundaries.  [7] We do not understand Justice Thomas to disagree with this fundamental conclusion.  Race Horse rested on the premise that treaty rights are irreconcilable with state sovereignty.  It is this conclusionthe conclusion undergirding the Race Horse Court's equal footing holdingthat we have consistently rejected over the years.  Justice Thomas' only disagreement is as to the scope of state regulatory authority.

 Then, using our canons of construction that ambiguities in treaties are often resolved in favor of the Indians, it concludes that the Treaty did not apply to the hunting rights.  I think this conclusion strained, indeed.  First, the language of the Treaty is so broad as to encompass " all " interests in land possessed or claimed by the Indians.  Second, while it is important to the Court that the Treaty "is devoid of any language expressly mentioningmuch less abrogatingusufructuary rights," ibid., the definition of "usufructuary rights" explains further why this is so. Usufructuary rights are "a real right of limited duration on the property of another." See Black's Law Dictionary 1544 (6th ed. 1990).  It seems to me that such a right would fall clearly under the sweeping language of the Treaty under any reasonable interpretation, and that this is not a case where "even `learned lawyers' of the day would probably have offered differing interpretations of the [treaty language]." Cf. Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S. 658, 677</citedDecision> (1979).  And third, although the Court notes that in other treaties the United States sometimes expressly mentioned cessions of usufructuary rights, there was no need to do so in this case, because the settled expectation of the United States was that the 1850 Executive Order had terminated the hunting rights of the Chippewa.  Thus, rather than applying the plain and unequivocal language of the 1855 Treaty, the Court holds that "all" does not in fact mean "all." *219 IV Finally, I note my disagreement with the Court's treatment of the equal footing doctrine, and its apparent overruling sub silentio of a precedent of 103 years' vintage.  In Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U. S. 504 (1896), we held that a Treaty granting the Indians "the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States, so long as game may be found thereon, and so long as peace subsists among the whites and the Indians on the borders of the hunting districts," did not survive the admission of Wyoming to the Union since the treaty right was "temporary and precarious." Id., at 515 .  But the Court, in a feat of jurisprudential legerdemain, effectively overrules Race Horse sub silentio.  First, the Court notes that Congress may only abrogate Indian treaty rights if it clearly expresses its intent to do so. Next, it asserts that Indian hunting rights are not irreconcilable with state sovereignty, and determines that "because treaty rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land within state boundaries."

" Id., at 683 (quoting 12 Stat. 953 ).  The Court held that Washington State had the "power to impose on Indians, equally with others, such restrictions of apurely regulatory nature concerning the time and manner of fishing outside the reservation as are necessary for the conservation of fish, " but that the Treaty foreclosed "the state from charging the Indians a fee of the kind in question." 315 U. S., at 684 (emphasis added).  Its conclusion was driven by the language of the Treaty as well as the report of the treaty negotiations and what it revealed to be the Yakimas' understanding of the Treatyto preserve their right "to hunt and fish in accordance with the immemorial customs of their tribes.  " Ibid. (emphasis added).  [1] Subsequent decisions evaluating state regulation by the conservation necessity standard similarly focused upon the language of the Treaty or agreement at issue and the Indians' understanding of the Treaty as revealed by the historical evidence.  See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S. 658, 665-669, 674685</citedDecision> (1979) (recognizing that the Court had construed the same Treaty language several times before, and emphasizing *224 the historical background against which the Treaty at issue was signed); Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 391 U. S. 392, 395, 397 (1968) (involving treaty language almost identical to that at issue in United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371 (1905), and Tulee, supra ); see also Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194, 206 (1975) (favorably comparing the somewhat different language of the agreement at issue with the language of the Treaties at issue in Winans and Puyallup ).  Most important, all the cases that the majority cites in support of the proposition that States may enforce against Indians in their exercise of off-reservation usufructuary activities only those regulations necessary for purposes of conservation, ante, at 204-205, involved the same or substantially similar treaty language reserving a right to hunt or fish. And all but Antoine also provided that the Indians could exercise their reserved rights at the usual and accustomed places.  In New York ex rel. Kennedy v. Becker, 241 U. S. 556 (1916), the Court considered significantly different language.  The Big Tree Treaty of 1797, as the agreement was known, provided that the Seneca were to retain "the privilege of fishing and hunting on the said tract of land" conveyed by the agreement.  7 Stat. 602 (emphasis added); see also 241 U. S., at 562 (quoting the reservation clause).  The Court characterized the Senecas' claim as one "sought to be maintained in derogation of the sovereignty of the State." Ibid. In rejecting such a claim, it stated: "[I]t can hardly be supposed that the thought of the Indians was concerned with the necessary exercise of inherent power under modern conditions for the preservation of wild life. But the existence of the sovereignty of the State was well understood, and this conception involved all that was necessarily implied in that sovereignty, whether fully appreciated or not.
**Combined Opinion**
 The implicit premise of this argument is that the President had the inherent power to order the removal of the Chippewa from public lands; this premise is flawed.  The Chippewa were on the land long before the United States acquired title to it.  The 1837 Treaty does not speak to the right of the United States to order them off the land upon acquisition of title, and in fact, the usufructuary rights guaranteed by the Treaty presumed that the Chippewa would continue to be on the land.  Although the revocation of the rights might have justified measures to make sure that the Chippewa were not hunting, fishing, or gathering, it does not follow that revocation of the usufructuary rights permitted the United States to remove the Chippewa from the land completely.  The Chief Justice's suggestion that the removal order was merely a measure to enforce the revocation of the usufructuary rights is thus unwarranted.  It cannot be presumed that the ends justified the means; it cannot be presumed that the rights of the United States under the Treaty included the right to order removal in defense of the revocation of usufructuary rights.  The Treaty, the statutory law, and the Constitution were silent on this matter, and to presume the existence of such Presidential power would run counter to the principles that treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the Indians, Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S. 658, 675-676</citedDecision> (1979), and treaty ambiguities to be resolved in their favor, Winters v. United States, 207 U. S. 564 , 576 577 (1908).  The Chief Justice also argues that the removal order ought to be severable from the part of the order purporting to extinguish Chippewa usufructuary rights because of the strong presumption supporting the legality of executive action that has been authorized expressly or by implication.  Post, at 215-216.  Presumably, The Chief Justice understands the 1837 Treaty to authorize the executive action in question.  In this context, however, any general presumption about the legality of executive action runs into the principle that treaty ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the Indians.  Winters v. United States, supra, at 576 577; see also County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992).  We do not think the general presumption relied upon by The Chief Justice carries the same weight when balanced against the counter presumption specific to Indian treaties.

 Rather, we cited Race Horse for the second part of its holding, discussed in the text, infra, at 206-208.  See 473 U. S., at 773, n. 23 .  In any event, the Race Horse Court's reliance on the equal footing doctrine to terminate Indian treaty rights rested on foundations that were rejected by this Court within nine years of that decision.  See United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 382-384 (1905).  [1]  The Court's assumption that "any general presumption about the legality of executive action runs into the principle that treaty ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the Indians," ante, at 194, n.5, illogically confuses the difference between executive authority and a principle of treaty construction.  The principle of Winters v. United States, 207 U. S. 564, 567-577 (1908), and County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992), that ambiguities in treaties are to be resolved in favor of the Indians, is only relevant to determining the intent of the parties to a treaty (that is the United States and the Indian tribe), and stems from the idea that in determining the intent of the parties, Indian tribes should be given the benefit of the doubt as against the United States in cases of ambiguous treaty provisions because the United States was presumptively a more sophisticated bargainer.  See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S. 658, 675-676</citedDecision> (1979).  But the determination of whether the President has power to enforce his revocation by removal is irrelevant to the intent of the parties to the treaty (the United States and the Chippewa in this case) and presents instead an issue of separation of powers (between the President and the Congress).  [2]  One notices the irony that where the President chose to explicitly eliminate the 1837 Treaty rights, the Court finds this specificity subsumed in the "removal order," and invalidates it as well.  [3]  The Court maintains that this reading of Race Horse is overbroad and would render any right created by operation of federal law "temporary and precarious." Ante, at 206.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The outer limit of what constitutes a "temporary and precarious" right is not before the Court (nor, since Race Horse is apparently overruled, will it ever be), but the hunting privilegesgranted in Race Horse and by the 1837 Treaty in this case reveal themselves to be "temporary and precarious" by their plain text: The privilege in Race Horse ended upon occupation of the hunting districts or the outbreak of hostilities, while the privilege in this case lasted only during the pleasure of the President.
