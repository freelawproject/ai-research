 .  .  .” (Emphasis supplied.) 38 Stat. 167 .  When the statute was amended in 1916, the one word “lawful” was omitted.  This revealed, we think, the obvious intent of that Congress to tax income derived from both legal and illegal sources, to remove the incongruity of having the gains of the honest laborer taxed and the gains of the dishonest immune.  Rutkin v. United States, supra, at p. 138; United States v. Sullivan, <citedDecision>274 U. S. 259, 263</citedDecision> .  Thereafter, the Court held that gains from illicit traffic in liquor are includible within “gross income.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> See also Johnson v. United States, 318 U. S. 189 ; United States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 503 .  And, the Court has pointed out, with approval, that there “has been a widespread and settled administrative and judicial recognition of the taxability of unlawful gains of many kinds,” Rutkin v. United States, supra, at p. 137.  These include protection payments made to racketeers, ransom payments paid to kidnappers, .bribes, money derived from the sale of unlawful insurance policies, graft, black market gains, funds obtained from the operation of lotteries, income from race track bookmaking and illegal prize fight pictures.  Ibid. The starting point in all cases dealing with the question of the scope of what is included in “gross income” begins with the basic premise that the purpose of Congress was “to use the full measure of its taxing power.” Helvering *219 v. Clifford, 309 U. S. 331, 334 .  And the Court has given a liberal construction to the broad phraseology of the “gross income” definition statutes in recognition of the intention of Congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted.  Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U. S. 28, 49 ; Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, 293 U. S. 84, 87-91 .  The language of § 22 (a) of the 1939 Code, “gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever,” and the more simplified language of § 61 (a) of the 1954 Code, “all income from whatever source derived,” have been held to encompass all “aeces- • sions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion.” Commissioner v. Clenshaw Glass Co., 348 U. S. 426, 431 .
