 See Treaty with the Chippewa of Sault Ste. Marie, Art, 1, 11 Stat. 631 (“The said Chippewa Indians surrender to the United States the right of fishing at the falls of St. Mary’s *196 ... secured to them by the treaty of June 16, 1820”).  6 See, e. g., Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397 U. S. 620, 631 (1970) (rejecting argument that language in Treaty had special meaning when United States was competent to state that meaning more clearly).  The State argues that any 1837 Treaty rights, or to usufructuary rights more generally, the second sentence of Article 1 nevertheless abrogates those rights.  But to determine whether this language abrogates Chippewa Treaty rights, we look beyond the written words to the larger context that frames the Treaty, including “the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties.” Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U. S. 423, 432 (1943); see also El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S. 155, 167 (1999).  In this case, an examination of the historical record provides insight into how the parties to the Treaty understood the terms of the agreement.  This insight is especially helpful to the extent that it sheds light on how the Chippewa signatories to the Treaty understood the agreement because we interpret Indian treaties to give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood them.  See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S. 658, 675-676</citedDecision> (1979); United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 380-381 (1905).  The 1855 was pewa land to the United States, not to terminate Chippewa usufructuary rights.  It was negotiated under the authority of the Act of December 19,1854.  This Act authorized treaty *197 negotiations with the Chippewa “for the extinguishment of their title to all the lands owned and claimed by them in the Territory of Minnesota and State of Wisconsin.” Ch. 7, 10 Stat. 598 .  The Act is silent with respect to authorizing agreements to terminate Indian usufructuary privileges, and this silence was likely not accidental.  During Senate debate on the Act, Senator Sebastian, the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, stated that the treaties to be negotiated under the Act would “reserv[e] to them [i e., the Chippewa] those rights which are secured by former treaties.” Cong. Globe, 33d Cong., 1st Sess., 1404 (1854).  summoned several Chippewa chiefs to Washington, D. C., to begin negotiations over the sale of Chippewa land in Minnesota to the United States.

 If the United States had intended to abrogate Chippewa usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty, it almost certainly would have included a provision to that effect in the 1854 Treaty, yet that Treaty contains no such provision.  To the contrary, it expressly secures new usufructuary rights to the signatory Bands on the newly ceded territory.  The State proposes no explanation— compelling or otherwise — for why the United States would have wanted to abrogate the Mille Lacs Band’s hunting and fishing rights, while leaving intact the other Bands’ rights to hunt and fish on the same territory.  *200 To summarize, the historical record provides no support for the theory that the second sentence of Article 1 was designed to abrogate the usufructuary privileges guaranteed under the 1837 Treaty, but it does support the theory that the Treaty, and Article 1 in particular, was designed to transfer Chippewa land to the United States.  At the very least, the historical record refutes the State’s assertion that the 1855 Treaty “unambiguously’ abrogated the 1837 hunting, fishing, and gathering privileges.  Given this plausible ambiguity, we cannot agree with the State that the 1855 Treaty abrogated Chippewa usufructuary rights.  We have held that Indian treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the Indians, <citedDecision>Washington</citedDecision> v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S., at 675-676</citedDecision> ; Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U. S., at 432 , and that any ambiguities are to be resolved in their favor, Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564, 576-577 (1908).  See also County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992).  To attack the conclusion that the 1855 Treaty rogate the usufructuary rights guaranteed under the 1837 Treaty, the State relies primarily on our decision in Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985).  Klamath required this Court to interpret two agreements.  In the first agreement, an 1864 Treaty between the United States and several Indian Tribes now collectively known as the Klamath Indian Tribe, the Indians conveyed their remaining lands to the United States, and a portion of this land was set aside as a reservation.  Id., at 755 .  The 1864 Treaty provided that the Tribe had the “ ‘exclusive right of taking fish in the streams and lakes, included in said reservation, and of gathering edible roots, seeds, and berries within its limits,’” but it provided for no off-reservation usufructuary rights.

 Rather, to reach our conclusion about the meaning of that language, we examined the historical record and considered the context of the treaty negotiations to discern what the parties intended by their choice of words.  This review of the history and the negotiations of the agreements is central to the interpretation of treaties.  El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S., at 167 .  As we described above, an analysis of the history, purpose, and negotiations of this Treaty leads us to conclude that the Mille Lacs Band did not relinquish their 1837 Treaty rights in the 1855 Treaty.  IV Finally, the State argues that the Chippewa’s usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty were extinguished when Minnesota was admitted to the Union in 1858.  In making this argument, the State faces an uphill battle.  Congress may abrogate Indian treaty rights, but it must clearly express its intent to do so. United States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734, 738-740 (1986); see also <citedDecision>Washington</citedDecision> v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S., at 690</citedDecision> ; Menominee Tribe v. United States, 391 U. S. 404, 413 (1968).  There must be “clear evidence that Congress actually considered the conflict between its intended action on the one hand and Indian treaty rights on the other, and chose *203 to resolve that conflict by abrogating the treaty.” United States v. Dion, supra, at 740 .  There is no such “clear evidence” of congressional intent to abrogate the Chippewa Treaty rights here.  The relevant statute — Minnesota’s enabling Act — provides in relevant part: “[T]he State of Minnesota shall be one, and is hereby declared to be one, of the United States of America, and admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever.” Act of May 11,1858, 11 Stat. 285 .  This language, like the rest of the Act, makes no mention of Indian treaty rights; it provides no clue that Congress considered the reserved rights of the Chippewa and decided to abrogate those rights when it passed the Act.  The State concedes that the Act is silent in this regard, Brief for Petitioners 36, and the State does not point to any legislative history describing the effect of the Act on Indian treaty rights.  With no direct support for its argument, the State relies principally on this Court’s decision in Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U. S. 504 (1896).

 See Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  As relevant here, it prevents the Federal Government from impair *204 ing fimdamental attributes of state sovereignty when it admits new States into the Union.  Id., at 573 .  According to the Race Horse Court, because the treaty rights conflicted irreconcilably with state regulation of natural resources— “an essential attribute of its governmental existence,” 163 U. S., at 516 — the treaty rights were held an invalid impairment of Wyoming’s sovereignty.  Thus, those rights could not survive Wyoming’s admission to the Union on “equal footing” with the original States.  But Race Horse rested on a subsequent eases have made clear, an Indian tribe’s treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on state land are not irreconcilable with a State’s sovereignty over the natural resources in the State.  See, e.g., Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel <citedDecision>Assn., supra; </citedDecision> see also Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194 (1975).  Rather, Indian treaty rights can coexist with state management of natural resources.  Although States have important interests in regulating wildlife and natural resources within their borders, this authority is shared with the Federal Government when the Federal Government exercises one of its enumerated constitutional powers, such as treaty making.  U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  See, e. g., Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920); Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529 (1976); United States v. Winans, 198 U. S., at 382-384 ; United States v. Forty-three Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U. S. 188 (1876).  See also Menominee Tribe v. United States, supra, at 411, n. 12.  Here, the 1837 Treaty gave the Chippewa the right to hunt, fish, and gather in the ceded territory free of territorial, and later state, regulation, a privilege that others did not enjoy.  Today, this freedom from state regulation curtails the State’s ability to regulate hunting, fishing, and gathering by the Chippewa in the ceded lands.  But this Court’s cases have also recognized that Indian treaty-based usufructuary rights do not guarantee the Indians “absolute freedom” from state regulation.  Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath *205 Tribe, 473 U. S., at 765, n. 16 .  We have repeatedly reaffirmed state authority to impose reasonable and necessary nondiscriminatory regulations on Indian hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in the interest of conservation.  See Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 391 U. S. 392, 398 (1968); Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S., at 682</citedDecision> ; Antoine v. Washington, supra, at 207-208.  This “conservation necessity” standard accommodates both the State’s interest in management of its natural resources and the Chippewa’s federally guaranteed treaty rights.  Thus, because treaty rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land within state boundaries.  7 We do not understand Justice Thomas to disagree with this fundamental conclusion.  Race Horse rested on the premise that treaty rights are irreconcilable with state sovereignty.  It is this conclusion — the conclusion undergirding the Race Horse Court’s equal footing holding — that we have consistently rejected over the years.  Justice Thomas’ only disagreement is as to the scope of state regulatory authority.

 The implicit premise of this argument is that the President had the inherent power to order the removal of the Chippewa from public lands; this premise is flawed.  The Chippewa were on the land long before the United States acquired title to it.  The 1837 Treaty does not speak to the right of the United States to order them off the land upon acquisition of title, and in fact, the usufructuary rights guaranteed by the Treaty presumed that the Chippewa would continue to be on the land.  Although the revocation of the rights might have justified measures to make sure that the Chippewa were not hunting, fishing, or gathering, it does not follow that revocation of the usufructuary rights permitted the United States to remove the Chippewa from the land completely.  The Chief Justice’s suggestion that the removal order was merely a measure to enforce the revocation of the usufructuary rights is thus unwarranted.  It cannot be presumed that the ends justified the means; it cannot be presumed that the rights of the United States under the Treaty included the right to order removal in defense of the revocation of usufructuary rights.  The Treaty, the statutory law, and the Constitution were silent on this matter, and to presume the existence of such Presidential power would run counter to the principles that treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the Indians, Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., <citedDecision>443 U. S. 658, 675-676</citedDecision> (1979), and treaty ambiguities to be resolved in their favor, Winters v. United States, 207 U. S. 564, 576-577 (1908).  The Chief Justice also argues that the severable from the part of the order purporting to extinguish Chippewa usufructuary rights because of the strong presumption supporting the legality of executive action that has been authorized expressly or by implication.  Post, at 215-216.  Presumably, The Chief Justice understands the 1837 Treaty to authorize the executive action in question.  In this context, however, any general presumption about the legality of executive action runs into the principle that treaty ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the Indians.  Winters v. United States, supra, at 576-577; see also County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992).  We do not think the general presumption relied upon by The Chief Justice carries the same weight when balanced against the counterpresumption specific to Indian treaties.
