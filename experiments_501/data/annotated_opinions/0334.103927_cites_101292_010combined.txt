 The boatswain, by direction of the mate, had cut the rope for the staging from a coil, which had been stored for two years in the Lyle gun box.  The rope, intended for use with the Lyle life-saving apparatus, had never been used.  There was testimony that it had been examined and tested by the boatswain and the mate, and that it was generally sound in appearance.  After the accident, examination of the rope at the point where it broke showed that it was so rotten as to be inadequate to support the strain imposed upon it.  The trial judge concluded from the evidence that there was sound rope on board available for rigging the staging.  He found that there was no fault in the manner in which the stage had been rigged, but that the rope selected by the mate was defective and that petitioner’s injury was attributable to the negligence of the boatswain and the *98 mate in failing to observe the defect.  1 He held that the proceeding was brought too late to recover for the negligence under the Jones Act, and that the “Wichita Falls” was not unseaworthy by reason of the defective rope used in rigging the staging, citing Plamals v. The Pinar Del Rio, <citedDecision>277 U. S. 151, 155</citedDecision> .  He accordingly denied indemnity to petitioner, but gave judgment in his favor for maintenance and cure.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, 129 F. 2d 857 , 135 F. 2d 602 , by a divided court, resting its decision on the statement quoted from the opinion in The Pinar Del Rio, supra, 155, that “The record does not support the suggestion that the ‘Pinar Del Rio’ was unseaworthy.  The mate selected a bad rope when good ones were available.” We granted certiorari, 320 U. S. 725 , upon a petition which urged that the statement quoted from The Pinar Del <citedDecision>Rio, supra,</citedDecision> does not rule this case, and that the decision below is inconsistent with the decisions in The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158 , and in Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, 305 U. S. 424 .  The sole issue presented by the petition for certiorari is that of respondent’s liability to indemnify petitioner for the injury suffered by reason of the defective staging.  No question is raised with respect to petitioner’s right to recover under the Jones Act or his right to the award of maintenance and cure or its adequacy.  A finding of seaworthiness is usually a finding of fact.  Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Co., 248 U. S. 139, 145 ; Steel v. State Line S. S. Co., L. R. 3 A. C. 72, 81-82, 90-91.  Ordinarily we do not, in admiralty, more than in other *99 cases, review the concurrent findings of fact of two courts below.  The Carib Prince, 170 U. S. 655, 658 ; The Wildcroft, 201 U. S. 378, 387 ; Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Co., supra; Piedmont Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., 254 U. S. 1, 13 ; Just v. Chambers, 312 U. S. 383, 385 .  Here, however, both courts below, holding themselves bound by The Pinar Del <citedDecision>Rio, supra,</citedDecision> have, on the facts found, held as a matter of law that the staging was seaworthy despite its defect.  That conclusion of law is reviewable here.  Until the enactment of the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007 , 46 U. S. C. § 688 , the maritime law afforded no remedy by way of indemnity beyond maintenance and cure, for the injury to a seaman caused by the mere negligence of a ship’s officer or member of the crew.  But the admiralty rule that the vessel and owner are liable to indemnify a seaman for injury caused by unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment, has been the settled law since this Court’s ruling to that effect in The Osceola, supra, 175 .  Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., 247 U. S. 372, 380-381 ; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, 259 U. S. 255, 258-260 ; Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 134 ; Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, 287 U. S. 367, 370-371 ; Warner v. Goltra, 293 U. S. 155, 158 ; The Arizona v. Anelich, 298 U. S. 110 , 120 et seq.; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, supra, 428-429 ; O’Donnell v. Great Lakes Co., 318 U. S. 36, 40 .  The latter rule seems to have been derived from the seaman’s privilege to abandon a ship improperly fitted out, and was generally applied, before its statement in The Osceola, supra, by numerous decisions of the lower federal courts during the last century.  See The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 121 , footnote 2.
**Combined Opinion**
It is not enough that the “Wichita Falls” had on board sound rope which could have been used to make the staging seaworthy, if in fact the staging was unsafe because sound rope was not used.  The Julia Fowler, supra; The Navarino, 7 F. 2d 743, 746 ; cf. The Portland, 213 F. 699 .  Respondent’s argument that the defective rope was a consumable supply of the vessel, not falling within the requirement that the owner must furnish seaworthy equipment appurtenant to the vessel, is inappropriate here because, as we have said, it was the stage which was unseaworthy, by reason of the use of the defective rope in its construction.  The stage was used in the repair of the ship, and was as intimately associated with it and with the seaman’s employment as are the gangways or other appliances or the passageways used by the seaman in doing his work.  Moreover it would not be enough to say that this case concerns a consumable supply, for in Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, the owner was held liable to a seaman for unseaworthiness, where a consumable supply of the ship was stored in such fashion as to render it dangerous to the seaman who used it.  There gasoline had been negligently placed in a can marked “coal oil” and the seaman was burned by an explosion which resulted when he attempted to build a fire with the gasoline, which he had taken out of the can thinking it to be coal oil.  The statement from The Pinar Del <citedDecision>Rio, supra,</citedDecision> relied upon by the two courts below, could be taken to support *105 their decision, only on the assumption either that the presence of sound rope on the “Wichita Falls” afforded an excuse for the failure to provide a safe staging, or that antecedent negligence of the mate in directing the use of the defective rope relieved the owner from liability for furnishing the appliance thereby rendered unseaworthy.  But as we have seen, neither assumption is tenable in the light of our decisions before and since The Pinar Del <citedDecision>Rio, supra.</citedDecision> So far as this statement supports these assumptions, it is disapproved.  We cannot follow it, and also follow The Osceola, supra, the cases which it approved and Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra. We prefer to follow the latter as the more consonant with principle and authority.  Reversed.  Mr. Justice Roberts: I think the judgment is wrong.  The case does not present a situation calling for liberalizing the maritime law in favor of seamen by abolishing the defense of a fellow seaman’s negligence.  Congress did that in 1920 ( 41 Stat. 1007 ).  But it required actions in such situations to be brought within two years, which it subsequently extended to three years.

 I should say nothing further on this question save that the method of reaching the decision seems to me contrary to right exercise of the judicial function.  The petitioner has undoubtedly obtained care and cure to which, as a seaman, he was entitled irrespective of fault on the part of owner or master.  He failed timely to avail himself of his right to sue under § 33 of the Jones Act.  In an action under that statute the defense of the negligence of a fellow servant would not have been open to the respondent.  In an effort to obtain damages, he brought *106 this action under the general maritime law. His recovery vel non under the unusual circumstances can be of little importance to others than himself and the respondent.  But, in order to give him the demanded relief, the court resorts to nullification of an earlier decision, Plamals v. Pinar Del Rio, 277 U. S. 151, indistinguishable in fact and law, which has stood unquestioned for sixteen years, and applied principles settled years before in The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158 .  The, history of <citedDecision>Plamals</citedDecision> v. Pinar Del Rio is important.  The libellant, a seaman on a British ship lying in United States waters, was ordered by a mate to repair a stack.  A sling was used, for which the mate selected a piece of rope. The rope broke and the seaman was injured.  He filed a libel in rem against the vessel.  The owner gave bond and released the ship.  The libel, after reciting the facts, alleged that the injuries were due “to the fault or neglect of the said steamship or those in charge of her in that the said rope was old, worn and not suitable for use.” The libel failed to refer to § 33 of the Jones Act, but, at the trial, the libellant’s proctor stated that he relied upon it.  The claimant in its answer asserted that the vessel was of British registry and, as the only redress open to the libellant was under the British Workmen’s Compensation Law, the Admiralty Court should decline jurisdiction.
