Mr. Justice White, concurring in the judgment.  Although I agree with the majority that the location clause at issue in this case is not a per se violation of the Sherman Act and should be judged under the rule of reason, I cannot agree that this result requires the overruling of United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., <citedDecision>388 U. S. 365</citedDecision> (1967).  In my view this case is'distinguishable from Schwinn because there is less potential for restraint of intrabrand competition and more potential for stimulating interbrand competition.  As to intrabrand competition, Sylvania, unlike Schwinn, did not restrict the customers to whom or the territories where its purchasers could sell.  As to interbrand competition, Syl-vania, unlike Schwinn, had an insignificant market share at the time it adopted its challenged distribution practice and enjoyed no consumer preference that would allow its retailers to charge a premium over other brands.  In two short paragraphs, the majority disposes of the view, adopted after careful analysis by the Ninth Circuit en banc below, that these differences provide a “principled basis for distinguishing Schwinn,” ante, at 46, despite holdings by three Courts of Appeals and the District Court on remand in Schwinn that *60 the per se rule established in that case does not apply to location clauses such as Sylvania’s.  To reach out to overrule one of this Court’s recent interpretations of the Sherman Act, after such a cursory examination of the necessity for doing so, is surely an affront to the principle that considerations of stare decisis are to be given particularly strong weight in the area of statutory construction.  Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736-737 (1977); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 175 (1976); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 671 (1974).

 Finally, many of the scholarly authorities the majority cites in support of its overruling of Schwinn have not had to strain to distinguish location clauses from the restrictions invalidated there.  E. g., Robinson, Recent Antitrust Developments: 1974, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 243 , 278 (1975) (outcome in Sylvania not preordained by Schwinn because of marked differences in the vertical restraints in the two cases); McLaren, Territorial and Customer Restrictions, Consignments, Suggested Retail Prices and Refusals to Deal, 37 Antitrust L. J. 137, 144M45 (1968) (by implication Schwinn exempts location clauses from its per se rule); Pollock, Alternative Distribution Methods After Schwinn, 63 Nw. U. L. Rev. 595 , 603 (1968) (“Nor does the Schwinn doctrine outlaw the use of a so-called ‘location clause’.  .  .”).  Just as there are significant differences between Schwinn and this case with respect to intrabrand competition, there are also significant differences with respect to interbrand competition.  Unlike Schwinn, Sylvania clearly had no economic power in the generic product market.  At the time they instituted their respective distribution policies, Schwinn was “the leading bicycle producer in the Nation,” with a national market share of 22.5%, <citedDecision>388 U. S., at 368, 374</citedDecision> , whereas Syl-vania was a “faltering, if not failing” producer of television sets, with “a relatively insignificant 1% to 2%” share of the national market in which the dominant manufacturer had a 60% to 70% share.  Ante, at 38, 58 n. 29.  Moreover, the Schwinn brand name enjoyed superior consumer acceptance and commanded a premium price as, in the District Court’s words, “the Cadillac of the bicycle industry.” 237 F. Supp., at 335 .  This premium gave Schwinn dealers a margin of *64 protection from interbrand competition and created the possibilities for price cutting by discounters that the Government argued were forestalled by Schwinn’s customer restrictions.  3 Thus, judged by the criteria economists use to measure market power — -product differentiation and market share 4 — Schwinn enjoyed a substantially stronger position in the bicycle market than did Sylvania in the television market.  This Court relied on Schwinn’s market position as one reason not to apply the rule of reason to the vertical restraints challenged there.  “Schwinn was not a newcomer, seeking to break into or stay in the bicycle business.  It was not a 'failing company.’ On the contrary, at the initiation of these practices, it was the leading bicycle producer in the Nation.” <citedDecision>388 U. S., at 374</citedDecision> .  And the Court of Appeals below found “another significant distinction between our case and Schwinn” in Syl-vania’s “precarious market share,” which “was so small when it adopted its locations practice that it was threatened with expulsion from the television market.” 537 F. 2d, at 991 .  5 *65 In my view there are at least two considerations, both relied upon by the majority to justify overruling Schwinn, that would provide a “principled basis” for instead refusing to extend Schwinn to a vertical restraint that is imposed by a “faltering” manufacturer with a “precarious” position in a generic product market dominated by another firm.  The first is that, as the majority puts it, “when interbrand competition exists, as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a significant check on the exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product.” Ante, at 52 n. 19.  See also ante, at 54.  6 Second is the view, argued forcefully in the economic literature cited by the majority, that the potential benefits of vertical restraints in promoting interbrand competition are particularly strong where the manufacturer imposing the restraints is seeking to enter a new market or to expand a small market share.  Ibid. 7 The majority even recognizes that Schwinn “hinted” at an exception for new entrants and failing firms from its per se rule.

 See also United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U. S. 321, 363 (1963), where the Court held presumptively illegal a merger “which produces a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market I see no doctrinal obstacle to excluding firms with such minimal market power as Sylvania’s from the reach of the Schwinn rule.  8 I have, moreover, substantial misgivings about the approach the majority takes to overruling Schwinn.  The reason for the distinction in Schwinn between sale and nonsale transactions was not, as the majority would have it, “the Court’s effort to accommodate the perceived intrabrand harm and interbrand benefit of vertical restrictions,” ante, at 52; the reason was rather, as Judge Browning argued in dissent below, the notion in many of our cases involving vertical restraints that inde *67 pendent businessmen should have the freedom to dispose of the goods they own as they see fit.  Thus the first case cited by the Court in Schwinn for the proposition that “restraints upon alienation .  .  .  are beyond the power of the manufacturer to impose upon its vendees and ... are violations of § 1 of the Sherman Act,” <citedDecision>388 U. S., at 377</citedDecision> , was this Court’s seminal decision holding a series of resale-price-maintenance agreements per se illegal, Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U. S. 373 (1911).  In Dr. Miles the Court stated that “a general restraint upon alienation is ordinarily invalid,” citing Coke on Littleton, and emphasized that the case involved “agreements restricting the freedom of trade on the part of dealers who own what they sell.” Id., at 404, 407-408 .  Mr. Justice Holmes stated in dissent: “If [the manufacturer] should make the retail dealers also agents in law as well as in name and retain the title until the goods left their hands I cannot conceive that even the present enthusiasm for regulating the prices to be charged by other people would deny that the owner was acting within his rights.” Id., at 411 .  This concern for the freedom of the businessman to dispose of his own goods as he sees fit is most probably the explanation for two subsequent cases in which the Court allowed manufacturers to achieve economic results similar to that in Dr. Miles where they did not impose restrictions on dealers who had purchased their products.  In United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U. S. 300 (1919), the Court found no antitrust violation in a manufacturer’s policy of refusing to sell to dealers who failed to charge the manufacturer’s suggested retail price and of terminating dealers who did not adhere to that price.  It stated that the Sherman Act did not “restrict the long recognized right of trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.” Id., at 307 .  In United States v. General Electric Co., 272 U. S. 476 (1926), the Court upheld resale-price-maintenance *68 agreements made by a patentee with its dealers who obtained its goods on a consignment basis.

 .  .  the opinions in those cases must be read in the light of their facts and of a clear recognition of the essential differences in the facts of those cases, and in the facts of any new case to which the rule of earlier decisions *71 is to be aplied.” Maple Flooring Mfrs. Assn. v. United States, 268 U. S. 563, 579 (1925).  In order to decide this case, the Court need only hold that a location clause imposed by a manufacturer with negligible economic power in the product market has a competitive impact sufficiently less restrictive than the Schwinn restraints to justify a rule-of-reason standard, even if the same weight is given here as in Schwinn to dealer autonomy.  I therefore concur in the judgment.  The franchised retailers would be prevented from engaging in discounting themselves if, under the Colgate doctrine, see infra, at 67, the *61 manufacturer could lawfully terminate dealers who did not adhere to his suggested retail price.  Given the Government’s emphasis on the inhibiting effect of the Schwinn restrictions bn discounting activities, the Court may well have been referring to this effect when it condemned the restrictions as “obviously destructive of competition.” <citedDecision>388 U. S., at 379</citedDecision> .  But the Court was also heavily influenced by its concern for the freedom of dealers to control the disposition of products they purchased from Schwinn.  See infra, at 66-69.  In any event, the record in Schwinn illustrates the potentially greater threat to intrabrand competition posed by customer as opposed to location restrictions.  Relying on the finding of the District Court, the Government argued: “[T]he declared purpose of the Schwinn franchising system [was] to establish and exploit a distinctive identity and superior consumer acceptance for the Schwinn brand name as the Cadillac of bicycles, thereby enabling the charging of a premium price .... This scheme could not possibly succeed, and doubtless would long ago have been abandoned, if in the consumer’s mind other bicycles were just as good as Schwinn’s.” Brief for United States, O. T. 1966, No. 25, p. 36.  See, e. g., F. Scherer, Industrial Market Structure and Economics Performance 10-11 (1970); P. Samuelson, Economics 485-491 (10th ed. 1976).  Schwinn’s national market share declined to 12.8% in the 10 years following the institution of its distribution program, at which time it ranked second behind a firm with a 22.8% share.  <citedDecision>388 U. S., at 368-369</citedDecision> .  In the three years following the adoption of its locations practice, Syl-vania’s national market share increased to 5%, placing it eighth among manufacturers of color television sets.  Ante, at 38-39.  At this time Sylvania’s shares of the San Francisco,, Sacramento, and northern Cali- *65 fomia markets were respectively 2.5%, 15%, and 5%.  Ante, at 39 im.  4, 6.  The District Court made no findings as to Schwinn’s share of local bicycle markets.
