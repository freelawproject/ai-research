The dissenting opinion in Passage 2 and Passage 3 argue that the majority's decision is inconsistent with Hamilton v. Alabama, but this does not imply that the case has been overruled. Passage 4 mentions that the authority of Cicenia v. Lagay and Crooker v. California was weakened by subsequent decisions, including Hamilton v. Alabama, but this does not suggest that Hamilton v.

In both instances, it is cited as a precedent to support the Court's decision, rather than being overruled or qualified. In Passage 1, the Court mentions that it granted certiorari to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule in light of recent decisions, including Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225 (1964). This suggests that the Court is building upon the Stiffel case, rather than overruling it. In Passage 2, Justice Black's dissenting opinion cites Stiffel as a precedent to support his argument, and notes that the Court's reservation of a question for future decision is in conflict with what was held in Stiffel. However, this does not indicate that the Stiffel case is being overruled, but rather that there is a disagreement about its application. Overall, the passages suggest that the Stiffel case remains good law and has not been overruled.""

This language suggests that the Court is overruling or significantly limiting the holding of Reitz v. Mealey. Additionally, in Passage 3, the Court notes that the argument raised in Reitz v. Mealey was 'rejected there by a five-to-four vote' and that the dissenters in that case raised concerns about the constitutionality of the statute. The Court's discussion of Reitz v. Mealey in these passages suggests that it is reevaluating and potentially overruling the holding of that case. Therefore, I conclude that Reitz v. Mealey has been overruled, at least in part.""

The Court also quotes Weems' language regarding the importance of considering contemporary values and the need for punishments to be graduated and proportioned to the offense.

The Court does, however, disagree with the Court of Appeals' interpretation of § 1983 and its application to local governmental officials and school boards. The Supreme Court's decision appears to be more of a clarification and expansion of the law rather than an explicit overruling of the case of interest.

In both instances, the Court is not explicitly overruling the case, but rather citing it as precedent to support its reasoning. In Passage 1, the Court quotes Justice Harlan's opinion in Jorn to explain the relationship between a defendant's motion for mistrial and the Double Jeopardy Clause. In Passage 2, the Court again cites Jorn, this time to emphasize the importance of protecting the accused against the burdens of multiple prosecutions. The tone and language used in both passages suggest that the Court is relying on Jorn as a relevant and authoritative precedent, rather than attempting to overrule or limit its holding.

Specifically, in Passage 3, the Court notes that 'the Court overrules today' the holding in Sanders. Additionally, in Passage 4, the Court mentions that the California Court of Appeal applied the 'critical distinction' from Chadwick, which was also applied in Sanders, but the Court of Appeal's decision was later affirmed by an equally divided Court in Oklahoma v. Castleberry. Furthermore, in Passage 1, the Court discusses the Ross case, which endeavored to distinguish between Carroll and Chadwick, and held that the Carroll doctrine covered searches of automobiles when the police had probable cause to search an entire vehicle, but that the Chadwick doctrine governed searches of luggage when the officers had probable cause to search only a container within the vehicle. This suggests that the Court has refined its jurisprudence in this area and has effectively overruled Sanders.""

While the case is mentioned in several passages, it is primarily cited as precedent for the proposition that Congress has the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment. In Passage 2, the plurality's reliance on Fitzpatrick is criticized, but this does not amount to an overruling of the case. In Passage 3, Justice Stevens' dissenting opinion mentions Fitzpatrick, but does not suggest that it has been overruled. In Passage 4, Justice Stevens' opinion again mentions Fitzpatrick, but this time to clarify the scope of the Court's holding in that case. Finally, in Passage 5, Fitzpatrick is cited as one of several cases that establish the principle that Congress has the power to deny states and their officials the right to rely on sovereign immunity in certain circumstances. None of these passages suggest that Fitzpatrick has been overruled, and therefore, I conclude that it remains good law.""
