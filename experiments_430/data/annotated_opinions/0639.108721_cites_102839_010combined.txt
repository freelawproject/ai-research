**Combined Opinion**
 We reached the same result in Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, 310 U. S. 362 , where Tennessee had used one system for making assessments under its ad valorem tax law as respects most taxpayers and a totally different one for public service corporations.  So far as equal protection was concerned, we said that the grievance of the particular complainant was “common to the whole class” and not “invidious to a particular taxpayer.” 5 Id., at 368 .  *364 Approval of the treatment “with that separateness” which distinguishes public service corporations from others, ibid., leads us to conclude in the present cases that making corporations and like entities, but not individuals, liable for ad valorem taxes on personal property does not transcend the requirements of equal protection.  In Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83 , a State laid an ad valorem tax of 50$ per $100 on deposits in banks outside the State and only 10(i per $1,000 on deposits within the State.  The classification was sustained against the charge of invidious discrimination, the Court noting that “in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.” Id., at 88 .  There is a presumption of constitutionality which can be overcome “only by the most explicit demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes.” Ibid. And the Court added, “The burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.” Ibid. That idea has been elaborated.  Thus, in Carmichael v. Southern Coal Co., <citedDecision>301 U. S. 495</citedDecision> , the Court, in sustaining an unemployment tax on employers, 6 said: “A state legislature, in the enactment of laws, has the widest possible latitude within the limits of the Constitution.  In the nature of the case it cannot record a complete catalogue of, the considerations which move its members to enact laws.  In the absence of such a record courts cannot assume that its action is capricious, or that, with its informed acquaintance with local conditions to which the legis *365 lation is to be applied, it was not aware of facts which afford reasonable basis for its action.  Only by faithful adherence to this guiding principle of judicial review of legislation is it possible to preserve to the legislative branch its rightful independence and its ability to function.” <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 510</citedDecision> .  Illinois tells us that the individual personal property tax was discriminatory, unfair, almost impossible to administer, and economically unsound.  Assessment practices varied from district to district.  About a third of the individuals paid no personal property taxes at all, while the rest paid on their bank accounts, automobiles, household furniture, and other resources, and in rural areas they paid on their livestock, grain, and farm implements as well.  As respects corporations, the State says, the tax is uniformly enforceable.  Illinois says, moreover, that Art. IX-A is only the first step in totally eliminating the ad valorem personal property tax by 1979 but for fiscal reasons it was impossible to abolish the tax all at once.  We could strike down this tax as discriminatory only if we substituted our judgment on facts of which we can be only dimly aware for a legislative judgment that reflects a vivid reaction to pressing fiscal problems.

 Those two cases were heard by the Illinois Supreme Court along with *359 a petition to file original suit with that court by one Maynard, who owned nonbusiness personal property, and by three school districts.  That petition was dismissed.  3 Classic examples are the taxes that discriminated against newspapers, struck down under the First Amendment (Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233 ) or that discriminated against interstate commerce (see Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157 ) or required licenses to engage in interstate commerce.  4 See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497 , decided May 17, 1954, which held that federal discrimination (in that case racial in nature) may be so arbitrary as to be violative of due process as the term is used in the Fifth Amendment.  5 In Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosjean, 301 U. S. 412 , a State classified chain stores for purposes of a chain store tax according to the number of stores — inside and outside the State.  The Court sustained the tax, saying: “The statute bears equally upon all who fall into the same class, and this satisfies the guaranty of equal protection.” Id., at 424 .  In Carmichael v. Southern Coal Co., <citedDecision>301 U. S. 495</citedDecision> , a State laid an unemployment tax on employers, excluding, inter alia, agriculture, domestic service, crews of vessels on navigable waters, and eleemosynary institutions.  The Court sustained the tax, saying: “This Court has repeatedly held that inequalities which result from a singling out of one particular class for taxation or exemption, infringe no constitutional limitation.” <citedDecision>
    Id.,
   
   at 509</citedDecision> .  And it added: “A legislature is not bound to tax every member of a class or none.  It may make distinctions of degree having a rational basis, and when *364 subjected to judicial scrutiny they must be presumed to rest on that basis if there is any conceivable state of facts which would support it.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> 6 Note 5, supra.
