<p id="A_">with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, and with whom Justice Breyer joins as to Part II, dissenting.</p>
<p id="b274-8">In this novel proceeding, petitioners seek relief from an injunction the District Court entered 12 years ago to implement our decision in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Felton, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">473 U. S. 402</a></span> (1985). For the reasons given by Justice Ginsburg, see <em>post, </em>p. 255, the Court’s holding that petitioners are entitled to relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) is seriously mistaken. The Court’s misapplication of the Rule is tied to its equally erroneous reading of our more recent Establishment Clause cases, which the Court describes as having rejected the underpinnings of <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>and portions of <em>Aguilar’s </em>companion case, <em>School Dist. of Grand Rapids </em>v. <em>Ball, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball">473 U. S. 373</a></span> (1985). The result is to repudiate the very reasonable line drawn in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

<p id="b275-6">In both <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

Ball">Ball</a></span>, </em>we held that supplemental instruction by public school teachers on the premises of religious schools during regular school hours violated the Establishment Clause. <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span>, </em>of course, concerned the very school system before us here and the same Title I program at issue now, see <em>ante, </em>at 211-212, under which local educational agencies receive public funds to provide remedial education, guidance, and job counseling to eligible students, including those attending religious schools. Immediately before <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span>, </em>New York City used Title I funds to provide guidance services and classes in remedial reading, remedial mathematics, and English as a second language to students at religious schools, as it did by sending employees of the public school system, including teachers, guidance counselors, psychologists, and social workers, into the religious schools. See <span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/#406" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton"><em>Aguilar, supra, </em>at 406</a></span>. <em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball">Ball</a></span> </em>involved a program similar in many respects to Title I called Shared Time,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under which the local school district provided religious school students with “supplementary” classes in their religious schools, taught by teachers who were full-time employees of the public schools, in subjects including remedial math and reading, art, music, and physical education. See 473 U. S., at 375.</p>
<p id="b275-7">We held that both schemes ran afoul of the Establishment Clause. The Shared Time program had the impermissible effect of promoting religion in three ways: first, state-paid teachers conducting classes in a sectarian environment might <page-number citation-index="1" label="242">*242</page-number>inadvertently (or intentionally) manifest sympathy with the sectarian aims to the point of using public funds for religious educational purposes, <em>id., </em>at 388; second, the government’s provision of secular instruction in religious schools produced a symbolic union of church and state that tended to convey a message to students and to the public that the State supported religion, <em>id., </em>at 390-392; and, finally, the Shared Time program subsidized the religious functions of the religious schools by assuming responsibility for teaching secular subjects the schools would otherwise be required to provide, <em>id., </em>at 395-396. Our decision in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>noted the similarity between the Title I and Shared Time programs, and held that the system New York City had adopted to monitor the religious content of Title I classes held in religious schools would necessarily result in excessive entanglement of church and state, and violate the Establishment Clause for that reason. See 473 U. S., at 412-414.</p>
<p id="b276-5">As I will indicate as I go along, I believe <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>was a correct and sensible decision, and my only reservation about its opinion is that the emphasis on the excessive entanglement produced by monitoring religious instructional content obscured those facts that independently called for the application of two central tenets of Establishment Clause jurisprudence. The State is forbidden to subsidize religion directly and is just as surely forbidden to act in any way that could reasonably be viewed as religious endorsement. See, <em>e. g., Ball, </em>473 U. S., at 385 (“Although Establishment Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause does absolutely prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith”); <em>id., </em>at 389 (“Government promotes religion as effectively when it fosters a close identification of its powers and responsibilities with those of any— or all — religious denominations as when it attempts to inculcate specific religious doctrines”) (citing <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111113"><a href="/opinion/111113/lynch-v-donnelly/#688" aria-description="Citation for case: Lynch v. Donnelly">465 U. S. 668, 688</a></span> (1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring)).</p>
<p id="b277-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="243">*243</page-number>As is explained elsewhere, the flat ban on subsidization antedates the Bill of Rights and has been an unwavering rule in Establishment Clause cases, qualified only by the conclusion two Terms ago that state exactions from college students are not the sort of public revenues subject to the ban. See <em>Rosenberger </em>v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., </em><span class="citation" data-id="117967"><a href="/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-visitors-of-university-of-virginia/#868" aria-description="Citation for case: Rosenberger v.

Rector &amp; Visitors of University of Virginia"><em>id., </em>at 850</a></span> (O’Connor, J., concurring). The rule expresses the hard lesson learned over and over again in the American past and in the experiences of the countries from which we have come, that religions supported by governments are compromised just as surely as the religious freedom of dissenters is burdened when the government supports religion. “When the government favors a particular religion or sect, the disadvantage to all others is obvious, but even the favored religion may fear being ‘taint[ed] .. . with a corrosive secularism.’ The favored religion may be compromised as political figures reshape the religion’s beliefs for their own purposes; it may be reformed as government largesse brings government regulation.” <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Weisman, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112779"><a href="/opinion/112779/lee-v-weisman/#608" aria-description="Citation for case: Lee v.

Ball"><em>Ball, supra, </em>at 385</a></span>); see also Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments 1785, in The Complete Madison 299, 309 (S. Padover ed. 1953) (“Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Government]”); M. Howe, The Garden and the Wilderness 6 (1965) (noting Roger Williams’s view that “worldly corruptions . . . might consume the churches if sturdy fences against the wilderness were not maintained”). The ban against state endorsement of religion addresses the same historical lessons. Governmental approval of religion tends to reinforce the religious message (at least in the short run) and, by the same token, to carry a message of exclusion to those of less favored views. See, <span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/#390" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v.

Weisman"><em>Lee, supra, </em>at 606-607</a></span> (Blackmun, J., concurring) (“When the government puts its <em>imprimatur </em>on a particular religion, it conveys a <em>message of </em>exclusion to all those who do not adhere to the favored beliefs. A government cannot be premised on the belief that all persons are created equal when it asserts that God prefers some”); <em>Engel </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106443"><a href="/opinion/106443/engel-v-vitale/#429" aria-description="Citation for case: Engel v. Vitale">370 U. S. 421, 429</a></span> (1962) (“[AJnguish, hardship and bitter strife” result “when zealous religious groups struggle] with one another to obtain the Government’s stamp of approval”). The human tendency, of course, is to forget the hard lessons, and to overlook the history of governmental partnership with religion when a cause is worthy, and bureaucrats have programs. That tendency to forget is the reason for having the Establishment Clause (along with the Constitution’s other structural and libertarian guarantees), in the hope of stopping the corrosion before it starts.</p>
<p id="b278-5">These principles were violated by the programs at issue in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

<p id="b279-5">What, therefore, was significant in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball">Ball</a></span> </em>about the placement of state-paid teachers into the physical and social settings of the religious schools was not only the consequent temptation of some of those teachers to reflect the schools’ religious missions in the rhetoric of their instruction, with a resulting need for monitoring and the certainty of entanglement. See <em>Aguilar, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/#412" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">473 U.

Ball">473 U. S., at 388</a></span> (risk of indoctrination). What was so remarkable was that the schemes in issue assumed a teaching responsibility indistinguishable from the responsibility of the schools themselves. The obligation of primary and secondary schools to teach reading necessarily extends to teaching those who are having a hard time at it, and the same is true of math. Calling some classes remedial does not distinguish their subjects from the schools’ basic sub<page-number citation-index="1" label="246">*246</page-number>jects, however inadequately the schools may have been addressing them.</p>
<p id="b280-5">What was true of the Title I scheme as struck down in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>will be just as true when New York reverts to the old practices with the Court’s approval after today. There is simply no line that can be drawn between the instruction paid for at taxpayers’ expense and the instruction in any subject that is not identified as formally religious. While it would be an obvious sham, say, to channel cash to religious schools to be credited only against the expense of “secular” instruction, the line between “supplemental” and general education is likewise impossible to draw. If a State may constitutionally enter the schools to teach in the manner in question, it must in constitutional principle be free to assume, or assume payment for, the entire cost of instruction provided in any ostensibly secular subject in any religious school. This Court explicitly recognized this in <span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/#394" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v.

Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>the Court concentrated on entanglement it noted the similarity to <em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v.

Felton"><em>Aguilar, supra, </em>at 409</a></span>, and Judge Friendly’s opinion for the Second Circuit made it expressly clear that there was no stopping place in principle once the public teacher entered the religious schools to teach their secular subjects. See <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Secretary, U S. Dept. of Education, </em><span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/F.%202d/739/48/">739 F. 2d 48</a></span>, 66-67 (CA2 1984), aff’d <em>sub nom. Aguilar </em>v. <em>Felton, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">473 U. S. 402</a></span> (1985).</p>
<p id="b280-6">It may be objected that there is some subsidy in remedial education even when it takes place off the religious premises, some subsidy, that is, even in the way New York City has administered the Title I program after <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span>. </em>In these circumstances, too, what the State does, the religious school need not do; the schools save money and the program makes it easier for them to survive and concentrate their resources on their religious objectives. This argument may, of course, prove too much, but if it is not thought strong enough to bar even off-premises aid in teaching the basics to religious school pupils (an issue not before the Court in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>or-<page-number citation-index="1" label="247">*247</page-number>today), it does nothing to undermine the sense of drawing a line between remedial teaching on and off premises. The off-premises teaching is arguably less likely to open the door to relieving religious schools of their responsibilities for secular subjects simply because these schools are less likely (and presumably legally unable) to dispense with those subjects from their currículums or to make patently significant cutbacks in basic teaching within the schools to offset the outside instruction; if the aid is delivered outside of the schools, it is less likely to supplant some of what would otherwise go on inside them and to subsidize what remains. On top of that, the difference in the degree of reasonably perceptible endorsement is substantial. Sharing the teaching responsibilities within a school having religious objectives is far more likely to telegraph approval of the school’s mission than keeping the State’s distance would do. This is clear at every level. As the Court observed in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball">Ball</a></span>, </em>“[t]he symbolism of a union between church and state [effected by placing the public school teachers into the religious schools] is most likely to influence children of tender years, whose experience is limited and whose beliefs consequently are the function of environment as much as of free and voluntary choice.” 473 U. S., at 390. When, moreover, the aid goes overwhelmingly to one religious denomination, minimal contact between state and church is less likely to feed the resentment of other religions that would like access to public money for their own worthy projects.</p>
<p id="b281-6">In sum, if a line is to be drawn short of barring all state aid to religious schools for teaching standard subjects, the <em>Aguilar-Ball </em>line was a sensible one capable of principled adherence. It is no less sound, and no less necessary, today.</p>
<p id="b281-3">II</p>
<p id="Aov">The Court today ignores this doctrine and claims that recent cases rejected the elemental assumptions underlying <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

On this point (and without reference to the facts that the benefited student had received the same aid before enrolling in the religious school and the employee was to be assigned to the student, not to the school) the Court explained itself this way: “[T]he task of a sign-language interpreter seems to us quite different from that of a teacher or guidance counselor. . . .

It held that the Shared Time program subsidized the religious functions of the parochial schools by taking over a significant portion of their responsibility for teaching secular subjects. See 473 U.

<p id="b285-5">It is, accordingly, puzzling to find the Court insisting that the aid scheme administered under Title I and considered in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

See App. 313-314.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead of serving individual blind or deaf students, as such, Title I as administered in New York City before <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

<p id="b286-5">Finally, instead of aid that comes to the religious school indirectly in the sense that its distribution results from private decisionmaking, a public educational agency distributes Title I aid in the form of programs and services directly to the religious schools.

Washington Department of Services for the Blind">Witters</a></span>, </em>it was fair to say that individual students were themselves applicants for individual benefits on a scale that could not amount to a systemic supplement. But under Title I, a local educational agency (which in New York City is the Board of Education) may receive federal funding by proposing programs approved to serve individual students who meet the criteria of need, which it then uses to provide such programs at the religious schools, see App. 28-29, 38, 60, 242-243; students eligible for such programs may not apply directly for Title I funds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The aid, accordingly, is not even formally aid to the individual students (and even formally individual aid must be seen as aid to a school system when so many individuals receive it that it becomes a significant feature of the system, see <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v.

<p id="b287-6">The Court notes that aid programs providing benefits solely to religious groups may be constitutionally suspect, while aid allocated under neutral, secular criteria is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion. <em>Ante, </em>at 230-231. The opinion then says that <em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v.

Title I services are available to all eligible children regardless of whether they go to religious or public schools, but, as I have explained elsewhere and am not alone in recognizing, see, <em>e. g., Rosenberger, </em><span class="citation" data-id="117967"><a href="/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-visitors-of-university-of-virginia/#846" aria-description="Citation for case: Rosenberger v.

If a scheme of government aid results in support for religion in some substantial degree, or in endorsement of its value, the formal neutrality of the scheme does not render the Establishment Clause helpless or the holdings in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

Ball">Ball</a></span> </em>inapposite.</p>
<p id="b287-3">III</p>
<p id="AmC">Finally, there is the issue of precedent. <em>Stare decisis </em>is no barrier in the Court’s eyes because it reads <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

Ball">Ball</a></span> </em>for exaggerated propositions that <em><span class="citation" data-id="111561"><a href="/opinion/111561/witters-v-washington-department-of-services-for-the-blind/" aria-description="Citation for case: Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind">Witters</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="112887"><a href="/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-district/" aria-description="Citation for case: Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District">Zobrest</a></span> </em>are supposed to have limited to the point of abandoned doctrine. Cf. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>McLean Credit Union, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112296"><a href="/opinion/112296/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/#173" aria-description="Citation for case: Patterson v. McLean Credit Union">491 U. S. 164, 173-174</a></span> (1989). The Court’s dispensation from <em>stare decisis </em>is, accordingly, no more convincing than its reading of those cases. Since <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>came down, no case has held that there need be no concern about a risk that publicly paid school teachers may further religious doctrine; no case has repudiated the distinction between direct and substantial aid <page-number citation-index="1" label="254">*254</page-number>and aid that is indirect and incidental; no case has held that fusing public and private faculties in one religious school does not create an impermissible union or carry an impermissible endorsement; and no case has held that direct subsidization of religious education is constitutional or that the assumption of a portion of a religious school’s teaching responsibility is not direct subsidization.</p>
<p id="b288-5">The continuity of the law, indeed, is matched by the persistence of the facts. When <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>was decided everyone knew that providing Title I services off the premises of the religious schools would come at substantial cost in efficiency, convenience, and money. Title I had begun off the premises in New York, after all, and dissatisfaction with the arrangement was what led the city to put the public school teachers into the religious schools in the first place. See <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Secretary, U. S. Dept. of Education, </em>739 F. 2d, at 51. When <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>required the end of that arrangement, conditions reverted to those of the past and they have remained unchanged: teaching conditions are often poor, it is difficult to move children around, and it costs a lot of money. That is, the facts became once again what they were once before, as everyone including the Members of this Court knew they would be. No predictions have gone so awry as to excuse the litigation from the claim of precedent, see <em>Burnet </em>v. <em>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="101894"><a href="/opinion/101894/burnet-v-coronado-oil-gas-co/#412" aria-description="Citation for case: Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.">285 U. S. 393, 412</a></span> (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting), let alone excuse the Court from adhering to its own prior decision in this very litigation.</p>
<p id="b288-6">That is not to deny that the facts just recited are regrettable; the object of Title I is worthy without doubt, and the cost of compliance is high. In the short run there is much that is genuinely unfortunate about the administration of the scheme under <em>Aguilar’s </em>rule. But constitutional lines have to be drawn, and on one side of every one of them is an otherwise sympathetic case that provokes impatience with the Constitution and with the line.
