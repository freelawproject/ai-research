**Dissenting Opinion**
 And if the petition for a writ of certiorari in this case had been filed a few months after, rather than a few months before, the passage of the 1968 Civil Rights Act, I venture to say that the case would have been deemed to possess such “isolated significance,” in comparison with its difficulties, that the petition would not have been granted.  For these reasons, I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.  This “state action” argument emphasizes the respondents’ role as housing developers exercising continuing authority over a suburban housing complex with about 1,000 inhabitants.  The Civil Rights Act of 1968, Pub, L. 90-284, 82 Stat. 73 .  Id., §§801-819.  See ante, at 417, n. 21.  See also Virginia v. Rives, <citedDecision>100 U. S. 313, 317-318</citedDecision> .  Section 1978 of the Revised Statutes.  See also Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 78-79 .  It seems to me that this passage is not dictum, as the Court terms it, ante, at 419 and n. 25, but a holding.  For if the Court had held the covenants in question invalid as between the parties, then it would not have had to rely upon a finding of “state action.” Despite the Court’s view that this reading flies in the face of the “plain and unambiguous terms” of the statute, see ante, at 420, it is not without precedent.  In the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , the Court said of identical language in the predecessor statute to § 1982: “[C]ivil rights, such as are guaranteed by the Constitution against State aggression, cannot be impaired by the wrongful acts of individuals, unsupported by State authority .... The wrongful act of an individual, unsupported by any such authority, is simply a private wrong, or a crime of that individual; an invasion of the rights of the injured party, it is true .  .
