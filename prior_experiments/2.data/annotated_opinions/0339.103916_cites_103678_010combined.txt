It is the public interest which is dominant in the patent system. Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1 ; Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322 , 329; Adams v. Burke, 17 Wall. 453 ; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., supra, pp. 510-511; Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co., supra ; United States v. Masonite Corp., <targetCase>316 U.S. 265</targetCase> , 278. It is the protection of the public in a system of free enterprise which alike nullifies a patent where any part of it is invalid ( Marconi Wireless Co. v. United States, 320 U.S. 1 , 58; and see General Electric Co. v. Wabash Corp., 304 U.S. 364 , 372) and denies to the patentee after issuance the power to use it in such a way as to acquire a monopoly which is not plainly within *666 the terms of the grant. The necessities or convenience of the patentee do not justify any use of the monopoly of the patent to create another monopoly. The fact that the patentee has the power to refuse a license does not enable him to enlarge the monopoly of the patent by the expedient of attaching conditions to its use. United States v. Masonite Corp., supra, p. 277. The method by which the monopoly is sought to be extended is immaterial. United States v. Univis Lens Co., supra, pp.
**Combined Opinion**
The record in the Leeds & Catlin case indicates that the point which we deem crucial in the instant case was adverted to only obliquely in the briefs. The Court was chiefly concerned with the proposition that a substitution or renewal of an unpatented element of a combination patent, as distinguished from its repair, is a "reconstruction" of the combination 213 U.S. pp. 333, 336.
