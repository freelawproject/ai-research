 Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40 , 44 47.  When it comes to taxes on corporations and taxes on individuals, great leeway is permissible so far as equal protection is concerned.  They may be classified differently with respect to their right to receive or earn income.  In Lawrence v. State Tax Comm’n, 286 U. S. 276, 283 , a state statute relieved domestic corporations of an income tax derived from activities carried on outside the State, but imposed the tax on individuals obtaining such income.  We upheld the tax against the claim that it violated the Equal Protection Clause, saying: “We cannot say that investigation in these fields would not disclose a basis for the legislation which would lead reasonable men to conclude that there is just ground for the difference here made.  The existence, unchallenged, of differences between the taxation of incomes of individuals and of corporations in every federal revenue act since the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, demonstrates that there may be.” Id., at 283-284 .  It is true that in Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania, <citedDecision>277 U. S. 389</citedDecision> , the Court held that a gross receipts tax *361 levied on corporations doing a taxi business violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, when no such tax was levied on individuals and partnerships operating taxicabs in competition with the corporate taxpayers.  Justices Holmes, Brandeis, and Stone dissented.  <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 403-412</citedDecision> .  Mr. Justice Holmes stated: “If usually there is an important difference of degree between the business done by corporations and that done by individuals, I see no reason why the larger businesses may not be taxed and the small ones disregarded, and I think it would be immaterial if here and there exceptions were found to the general rule.  .  .  .  Furthermore if the State desired to discourage this form of activity in corporate form and expressed its desire by a special tax I think that there is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent it.” <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 403</citedDecision> .  Each of these dissenters thought Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107 , should govern Quaker City Cab.  The Flint case involved a federal tax upon the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity, but it was not laid on businesses carried on by a partnership or private individual.  It was, therefore, contended that the tax was “so unequal and arbitrary” as to be beyond the power of Congress.  Id., at 158 .  We had not yet held that the Fifth Amendment in its use of due process carries a mandate of equal protection.  4 But the Court in dictum stated: “[I]t could not be said, even if the principles of the Fourteenth Amendment were applicable to the present case, that there is no substantial difference be *362 tween the carrying on of business by the corporations taxed, and the same business when conducted by a private firm or individual.
**Combined Opinion**
 Illinois tells us that the individual personal property tax was discriminatory, unfair, almost impossible to administer, and economically unsound.  Assessment practices varied from district to district.  About a third of the individuals paid no personal property taxes at all, while the rest paid on their bank accounts, automobiles, household furniture, and other resources, and in rural areas they paid on their livestock, grain, and farm implements as well.  As respects corporations, the State says, the tax is uniformly enforceable.  Illinois says, moreover, that Art. IX-A is only the first step in totally eliminating the ad valorem personal property tax by 1979 but for fiscal reasons it was impossible to abolish the tax all at once.  We could strike down this tax as discriminatory only if we substituted our judgment on facts of which we can be only dimly aware for a legislative judgment that reflects a vivid reaction to pressing fiscal problems.  Quaker City Cab Co. v. <citedDecision>Pennsylvania</citedDecision> is only a relic of a bygone era.  We cannot follow it and stay within the narrow confines of judicial review, which is an important part of our constitutional tradition.  Reversed.  1 In 1969, the Illinois Legislature had provided for the submission of the proposed amendment to a referendum vote.  2 The result was either to reverse with directions to dismiss the complaints or to affirm the judgment that dismissed the complaints.  Those two cases were heard by the Illinois Supreme Court along with *359 a petition to file original suit with that court by one Maynard, who owned nonbusiness personal property, and by three school districts.  That petition was dismissed.
