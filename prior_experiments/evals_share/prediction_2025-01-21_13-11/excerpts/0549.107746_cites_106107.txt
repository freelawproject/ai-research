Case of interest: Elkins v. United States (1960)
-----------------------
ucts of such violations as evidence. That doctrinal underpinning of the Schwartz decision was, of course, completely removed by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, which overruled Wolf and squarely held that evidence obtained by state officers in an unreasonable search is inadmissible in a state criminal trial.
In view of the Nardone and Benanti decisions,[8] the doctrine of Schwartz v. Texas cannot survive the demise of Wolf v. Colorado, supra. In the Mapp case, the Court in overruling Wolf imposed a judicially devised exclusionary rule in order to insure that a State could not adopt rules of evidence calculated to permit the invasion of rights protected by federal organic law. In the present case the federal law itself explicitly protects intercepted communications from divulgence, in a court or any other place.
But the decision we reach today is not based upon language and doctrinal symmetry alone. It is buttressed as well by the "imperative of judicial integrity." Elkins v. United States, <caseOfInterest>364 U.S. 206</caseOfInterest>, 222.[9] Under our Constitution *386 no court, state or federal, may serve as an accomplice in the willful transgression of "the Laws of the United States," laws by which "the Judges in every State [are] bound . . . ."[10]
Finally, our decision today is counseled by experience. The hope was expressed in Schwartz v. Texas that "[e]nforcement of the statutory prohibition in § 605 can be achieved under the penal provisions" of the Communications Act. 344 U.S., at 201.[11] That has proved to be a vain hope. Research has failed to uncover a single reported prosecution of a law enforcement officer for violation of § 605 since the statute was enacted.[12] We conclude, as we concluded in Elkins and in Mapp, that *387 nothing short of mandatory exclusion of the illegal evidence will compel respect for the federal law "in the only effectively available wayby removing the incentive to disregard it." Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S., at 217.

iretapping" within the scope of the state constitutional prohibition. The court based its conclusions upon several previous Florida cases: Perez v. State, 81 So. 2d 201; Williams v. State, 109 So. 2d 379; Griffith v. State, 111 So. 2d 282; Barber v. State, 172 So. 2d 857.
[5]  A party-line user's privacy is obviously vulnerable, but it does not necessarily follow that his telephone conversations are completely unprotected by § 605. In many areas of the country private telephone lines are not available; in other areas they are available only at higher rates than party lines. There is nothing in the language or history of § 605 to indicate that Congress meant to afford any less protection to those who, by virtue of geography or financial hardship, must use party-line telephones.
[6]  Section 605 prohibits interception and divulgence of intrastate as well as interstate communications. Weiss v. United States, 308 U.S. 321.
[7]  It was not until two Terms later, in Elkins v. United States, <caseOfInterest>364 U.S. 206</caseOfInterest>, that the Court repudiated the "silver platter doctrine," under which evidence obtained by state officers in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments could be received as evidence in federal courts.

[9]  "[I]t cannot be lawful to authorize what is an illegal act. . . . [I]f the police officer violates the Federal statute by tapping wires notwithstanding a warrant issued out of this court pursuant to New York lawif that act be illegalthose who set the act in motion have condoned if not instigated illegality. . . . [T]he warrant itself partakes of the breach, willful or inadvertent, of the Federal law. Such breach may not find sanction in the orders of courts charged with the support of the law of the land and with enforcing that law!" In re Telephone Communications, 9 Misc. 2d 121, 126, 170 N. Y. S. 2d 84, 89 (N. Y. Sup. Ct.).

[12]  In Pugach v. Klein, 193 F. Supp. 630, a defendant in a state criminal case attempted unsuccessfully to initiate a criminal prosecution against state officers for violations of § 605. See also Simons v. O'Connor, 187 F. Supp. 702 (denying damages in action against state officer for violation of § 605).

There seem to be only three reported prosecutions of private individuals for violations of § 605. United States v. Gruber, 123 F.2d 307; United States v. Gris, 247 F.2d 860; Elkins v. United States, <caseOfInterest>364 U.S. 206</caseOfInterest>.
[*]  Nardone v. United States, 302 U.S. 379, established that divulgence of intercepted communications in court was a violation of § 605. The Court went on to hold that a federal conviction resulting from such a violation was itself improper. The Court did not, however, make it clear whether the Act required that result by its own force or the Court was simply imposing that result by virtue of its supervisory power.
