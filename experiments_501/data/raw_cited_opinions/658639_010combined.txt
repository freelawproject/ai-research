      <p class="indent">These two consolidated cases present the following issue:  whether Congress successfully abrogated the states' Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity from suit by enacting the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act ("IGRA"), Pub.L. No. 100-497, <span class="citation no-link">102 Stat. 2467</span> (1988) (codified at 25 U.S.C. Secs. 2701-21).<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a>  The two district court judges below agreed that IGRA manifested Congress' attempt to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity;  they disagreed, however, as to whether Congress possesses the power under the Constitution to accomplish that abrogation.</p>

      <span class="num">2</span>
      <p class="indent">We hold that, although decisions of the Supreme Court demonstrate that Congress does possess the power to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity in certain cases, Congress did not possess that power when enacting IGRA under the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art.  I, Sec. 8, cl. 3.  Thus, the states retain their sovereign immunity and the federal courts do not have subject-matter jurisdiction over suits brought under IGRA.  Accordingly, these cases must be dismissed.</p>

      <p class="indent">In 1987, the Supreme Court held that a state could not enforce its "civil/regulatory" gaming laws in a manner that would prohibit gaming on Indian lands within its borders.  California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, <span class="citation" data-id="111828"><a href="/opinion/111828/california-v-cabazon-band-of-mission-indians/">480 U.S. 202</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="111828"><a href="/opinion/111828/california-v-cabazon-band-of-mission-indians/">107 S.Ct. 1083</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="111828"><a href="/opinion/111828/california-v-cabazon-band-of-mission-indians/">94 L.Ed.2d 244</a></span> (1987).  That decision left Indian gaming largely unregulated by the states;  similarly, "existing federal law d[id] not provide clear standards or regulations for the conduct of gaming on Indian lands."  25 U.S.C. Sec. 2701(3).  In an attempt to supply some much-needed regulation, and after contentious debate concerning the appropriate state role in the regulation of Indian gaming, Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  IGRA's primary purpose was "to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments."  Sec.  2702(1).  In order to accomplish this goal, Congress defined classes of Indian gaming, Sec. 2703(6)-(8);  established the National Indian Gaming Commission to monitor and regulate some forms of Indian gaming, Secs. 2704-08;  and provided a compacting procedure by which states might participate in the regulation of certain forms of Indian gaming, Sec. 2710(d).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p5">
      <span class="num">5</span>
      <p class="indent">Briefly summarized, Congress divided Indian gaming into three "classes."   Class I gaming, which is governed and regulated solely by individual Indian tribes, includes little more than "social games solely for prizes of minimal value...."  Sec. 2703(6).  Class II gaming, which is subject to certain federal regulations, includes bingo and comparable games as well as non-banking card games where not prohibited by state law.<a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref">3</a>  Sec. 2703(7)(A).  Neither of these classes is relevant to the cases on appeal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p6">
      <span class="num">6</span>
      <p class="indent">These cases address the third class of gaming.  Class III gaming is defined residually;  it includes "all forms of gaming that are not class I gaming or class II gaming."  Sec.  2703(8).  Specifically excluded from class II, and therefore within the parameters of class III, are banking card games and "electronic or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance or slot machines of any kind."  Sec.  2703(7)(B).  Class III gaming is the type of gaming most profitable to the tribes;  it also is the gaming in which the states desire the greatest regulatory oversight.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p7">
      <span class="num">7</span>
      <p class="indent">In order to achieve a compromise between the interests of the states and the interests of the Indian tribes, Congress mandated that class III gaming activities would be lawful on Indian lands only when those activities are (a) authorized by the tribe;  (b) located in a state that permits such gaming;  and, most importantly, (c) "conducted in conformance with a Tribal-State compact entered into by the Indian tribe and the State ... that is in effect."  Sec.  2710(d)(1).  To ensure that dilatory actions by the state could not preclude or unreasonably delay Indian gaming, IGRA also delineated a negotiating process designed to culminate in the Tribal-State compact and provided mechanisms to remedy state misconduct.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p8">
      <span class="num">8</span>
      <p class="indent">Under the statute, the tribe initiates the compacting process by requesting that the state enter into negotiations for the purpose of concluding a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities;  in IGRA, Congress mandated that the state "shall negotiate with the Indian tribe in good faith to enter into a compact."  Sec.  2710(d)(3)(A).  If these negotiations bear fruit, the compact must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior and published in the Federal Register.  Sec.  2710(d)(8).</p>

    <div class="num" id="p9">
      <span class="num">9</span>
      <p class="indent">Congress also anticipated that Tribal-State negotiations would not always produce a mutually satisfactory compact;  it thus provided tribes with a remedy in the federal courts:</p>

Sec.  2710(d)(7)(B)(iii).  If that fails, "the Indian tribe and the State shall each submit to a mediator appointed by the court a proposed compact that represents their last best offer for a compact."  Sec.  2710(d)(7)(B)(iv).  The mediator then selects the better of the two proposals and submits it to the tribe and the state.  The state then either may consent to the compact within sixty days, in which case the compact is treated as if it were the product of negotiations;  or may refuse to consent, in which case the Secretary of the Interior provides procedures to regulate the tribe's class III gaming.

      <p class="indent">The facts of these cases are few and easily summarized.  The first case, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, No. 92-4652, was filed by the Seminole Tribe, federally recognized as a tribe under Section 16 of the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C.A. Sec. 476 (West 1983 &amp; Supp.1993).  The complaint, filed in the Southern District of Florida on September 19, 1991, asserted jurisdiction largely under 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2710(d)(7)(A)(i) and alleged that the State of Florida and its governor, Lawton Chiles, had "failed to respond in good faith to the Tribe's request for compact negotiations and have not conducted those negotiations in good faith."   Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction based on the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the State of Florida and the Governor of Florida under the Eleventh Amendment.  On June 18, 1992, the district court denied the motion, <span class="citation" data-id="1944640"><a href="/opinion/1944640/seminole-tribe-of-florida-v-state-of-fla/">801 F.Supp. 655</a></span> (S.D.Fla.1992) ("Seminole "), and this interlocutory appeal ensued.</p>

      <span class="num">17</span>
      <p class="indent">The second case, Poarch Band of Creek Indians v. Alabama, No. 92-6244, presents a similar initial fact pattern.  The Poarch Band, also a federally recognized tribe, filed suit against the State of Alabama and its governor, Guy Hunt (for whom the current governor, James E. Folsom, Jr., has been substituted), on September 11, 1991.  Also asserting jurisdiction largely under 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2710(d)(7)(A)(i), the complaint is designed to resolve for the State and the Tribe various questions regarding IGRA's definition of class III gaming.  The State of Alabama's answer claimed a defense of sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment;  the district court granted the State's subsequent motion to dismiss based upon this defense on October 30, 1991.  <span class="citation" data-id="2341082"><a href="/opinion/2341082/poarch-band-of-creek-indians-v-state-of-ala/">776 F.Supp. 550</a></span> (S.D.Ala.1991) ("Poarch I ").<a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref">4</a>  The governor also filed an Eleventh-Amendment-based motion to dismiss;  the district court granted it on February 20, 1992, thus dismissing the final defendant and terminating the Poarch Band's suit.  <span class="citation" data-id="1907681"><a href="/opinion/1907681/poarch-band-of-creek-indians-v-state-of-ala/">784 F.Supp. 1549</a></span> (S.D.Ala.1992) ("Poarch II ").

      <p class="indent">In 1890, however, the Supreme Court rejected this facial reading.  In Hans v.

Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., <span class="citation" data-id="112291"><a href="/opinion/112291/pennsylvania-v-union-gas-co/">491 U.S. 1</a></span>, 31-32, <span class="citation" data-id="112291"><a href="/opinion/112291/pennsylvania-v-union-gas-co/">109 S.Ct. 2273</a></span>, 2297, <span class="citation" data-id="112291"><a href="/opinion/112291/pennsylvania-v-union-gas-co/">105 L.Ed.2d 1</a></span> (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

      <span class="num">24</span>
      <p class="indent">It did not survive untarnished, however;  the Court subsequently has held that the states' immunity is not absolute.  More specifically, the states are not immune from suit if the circumstances indicate consent, abrogation, or the fiction of Ex parte Young.   If none of these three exceptions applies, however, the Eleventh Amendment serves as a jurisdictional bar to the suit.  See Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, <span class="citation" data-id="111094"><a href="/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/">465 U.S. 89</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="111094"><a href="/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/">104 S.Ct. 900</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="111094"><a href="/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/">79 L.Ed.2d 67</a></span> (1984).

      <span class="num">25</span>
      <p class="indent">First, the Supreme Court has held that the states may not rely on the defense of sovereign immunity if they have consented to suit.  A court may find consent in three circumstances.  The clearest of the three, known as express consent, usually takes the form of legislative enactment.  The second form of consent derives from the states' ratification of the Constitution.  This "plan of the convention" consent assumes that, by ratifying the Constitution and joining the republic, each state ceded certain powers to the federal system;  implicit in this cession is the understanding that the state necessarily also consented to suit in certain cases.  Thus, the Court has held that, by ratifying the Constitution, the states waived their immunity to suits by the United States, see, e.g., United States v. Texas, <span class="citation" data-id="93289"><a href="/opinion/93289/united-states-v-texas/">143 U.S. 621</a></span>, 641-46, <span class="citation" data-id="93289"><a href="/opinion/93289/united-states-v-texas/">12 S.Ct. 488</a></span>, 492-94, <span class="citation" data-id="93289"><a href="/opinion/93289/united-states-v-texas/">36 L.Ed. 285</a></span> (1892);  and by sister states, see, e.g., South Dakota v. North Carolina, <span class="citation" data-id="95997"><a href="/opinion/95997/south-dakota-v-north-carolina/">192 U.S. 286</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="95997"><a href="/opinion/95997/south-dakota-v-north-carolina/">24 S.Ct. 269</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="95997"><a href="/opinion/95997/south-dakota-v-north-carolina/">48 L.Ed. 448</a></span> (1904).  Finally, the Court has created a third, extremely limited category of consent.  This consent is premised on the state's participation in a congressional program which, as a prerequisite for participation, mandates that the state consent to suit.  The Court has found this form of consent to exist in only one case:  Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama, <span class="citation" data-id="106821"><a href="/opinion/106821/parden-v-terminal-r-co-of-ala-docks-dept/">377 U.S. 184</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="106821"><a href="/opinion/106821/parden-v-terminal-r-co-of-ala-docks-dept/">84 S.Ct. 1207</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="106821"><a href="/opinion/106821/parden-v-terminal-r-co-of-ala-docks-dept/">12 L.Ed.2d 233</a></span> (1964).</p>

      <p class="indent">In Parden, the Supreme Court for the first--and, to date, last--time found that a state had waived its immunity to suit by participating in a federal program mandating that participants consent to suit.

      <p class="indent">First, it is apparent that Parden was decided largely on its facts.  In that case, the State of Alabama had operated a for-profit, state-owned railroad for twenty years.  By operating the railroad in interstate commerce, Alabama effectively had transcended the typical realm of state authority by entering the private market, a market in which all employers were subject to the strictures passed by Congress.  The limited holding of the Court was that, based on these facts, Alabama should be subject to the same requirements as the other (private) participants in the private market;  one of those requirements was that all market actors consent to suit.  These cases involve state governments negotiating with sovereign tribes located within the states' borders--hardly a "private" activity--and thus do not raise the same concerns that prompted the Supreme Court's unique decision in Parden.</p>

      <p class="indent">Second, later decisions of the Supreme Court limit Parden and indicate that Alabama and Florida cannot be said to have consented to suit in this case.  First, in Employees v. Missouri Dep't of Public Health and Welfare, <span class="citation" data-id="108763"><a href="/opinion/108763/employees-v-missouri-public-health-dept/">411 U.S. 279</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="108763"><a href="/opinion/108763/employees-v-missouri-public-health-dept/">93 S.Ct. 1614</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="108763"><a href="/opinion/108763/employees-v-missouri-public-health-dept/">36 L.Ed.2d 251</a></span> (1973), the Court declined to extend Parden to circumstances in which a state was operating a non-profit hospital facility, a traditional state activity.  The next year, in Edelman v. Jordan, <span class="citation" data-id="108990"><a href="/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/">415 U.S. 651</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="108990"><a href="/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/">94 S.Ct. 1347</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="108990"><a href="/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/">39 L.Ed.2d 662</a></span> (1974), the Court refused to find Parden-style consent when Illinois participated in a federal program by agreeing to administer federal and state funds in accordance with federal law.  The Court reiterated this holding a decade later in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, <span class="citation" data-id="111503"><a href="/opinion/111503/atascadero-state-hospital-v-scanlon/">473 U.S. 234</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="111503"><a href="/opinion/111503/atascadero-state-hospital-v-scanlon/">105 S.Ct. 3142</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="111503"><a href="/opinion/111503/atascadero-state-hospital-v-scanlon/">87 L.Ed.2d 171</a></span> (1985).  Finally, the Court further limited Parden in Welch v. Texas Dep't of Highways and Public Transp., <span class="citation" data-id="111949"><a href="/opinion/111949/welch-v-texas-dept-of-highways-and-public-transp/">483 U.S. 468</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="111949"><a href="/opinion/111949/welch-v-texas-dept-of-highways-and-public-transp/">107 S.Ct. 2941</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="111949"><a href="/opinion/111949/welch-v-texas-dept-of-highways-and-public-transp/">97 L.Ed.2d 389</a></span> (1987).

      <p class="indent">When Parden and its progeny are examined closely, it is apparent that, although Parden may not be entirely dead, it certainly is not quick enough to breathe life into the Indian tribes' claims in these cases.  In these cases, the states were faced with a Hobson's choice:  refuse to negotiate with the tribes, and therefore be subject to suit under IGRA;  or negotiate with the tribes, and therefore (according to the tribes' argument) consent to suit under IGRA.  Thus, we cannot find the same voluntary, for-profit, private-enterprise operation involved in Parden and decline to hold that Alabama and Florida consented to suit.<a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref">5</a></p>

We also must find that Congress possessed the power under the Constitution to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.

      <p class="indent">Several courts have addressed the question whether Congress unequivocally intended to abrogate the states' immunity when it enacted IGRA.  Those courts have had little difficulty concluding that Congress' intent was sufficiently clear.  See, e.g., Cheyenne II, 3 F.3d at 280;  Kickapoo, 818 F.Supp. at 1427 ("[A] clearer statement of the intent to abrogate is difficult to envision.");  Seminole, <span class="citation" data-id="1944640"><a href="/opinion/1944640/seminole-tribe-of-florida-v-state-of-fla/">801 F.Supp. at 658</a></span>;  Sault Ste.

    <div class="num" id="p41">
      <span class="num">41</span>
      <p class="indent">In Dellmuth, the Supreme Court reiterated its earlier holdings that a congressional declaration abrogating the states' Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity must be explicit:  "As we made plain in Atascadero, '[a] general authorization for suit in federal court is not the kind of unequivocal statutory language sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment.'  <span class="citation" data-id="111503"><a href="/opinion/111503/atascadero-state-hospital-v-scanlon/">473 U.S. at 246</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="111503"><a href="/opinion/111503/atascadero-state-hospital-v-scanlon/">105 S.Ct. at 3149</a></span>."  491 U.S. at 231, 109 S.Ct. at 2402.   At first glance, it would appear that IGRA fails that test:  Instead of specifically abrogating the states' immunity, section 2710(d)(7)(A) states only that "[t]he United States district courts shall have jurisdiction...."  The mere granting of jurisdiction is not equivalent to the abrogation of a defense.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p42">
      <span class="num">42</span>
      <p class="indent">A closer examination of IGRA, however, reveals that, despite Congress' omission of a specific abrogation clause, Congress nonetheless manifested its intent to abrogate the states' immunity.  IGRA gives the federal district courts jurisdiction over three types of cases, the first of which is "any cause of action initiated by an Indian tribe arising from the failure of a State to enter into negotiations with the Indian tribe for the purpose of entering into a Tribal-State compact under paragraph (3) or to conduct such negotiations in good faith."  Sec.  2710(d)(7)(A)(i).  The only possible defendant to such a suit is a state (see part IV(C), below).  Thus, unless Congress intended to abrogate the states' immunity, this portion of IGRA would be of no effect.  Charged as we are with the task of giving effect to each portion of a statute, we must conclude that Congress intended to abrogate the states' sovereign immunity.<a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref">8</a>  Thus, we hold that the first prong of our inquiry is satisfied.2.</p>

      <p class="indent">More important, and less easily met, is the second prong of our inquiry:  whether Congress possessed the constitutional power to abrogate the states' immunity when it enacted IGRA.  To resolve this issue, we initially must determine under which provision(s) of the Constitution Congress enacted IGRA (see sub-part a).  Only then can we determine whether Congress possessed the power to abrogate the states' immunities (see sub-part b).</p>

As we mentioned earlier, the Supreme Court has held that Congress possesses abrogation powers only when it enacts legislation under the auspices of (1) Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment or (2) the Interstate Commerce Clause.  Plaintiff tribes urge us to find that IGRA was passed not only pursuant to the Indian Commerce Clause, but also pursuant to Section 5 and the Interstate Commerce Clause.<a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref">9</a>  We cannot so find.</p>

    <div class="num" id="p46">
      <span class="num">46</span>
      <p class="indent">First, as to the Fourteenth Amendment, plaintiff tribes claim that Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, <span class="citation" data-id="109520"><a href="/opinion/109520/fitzpatrick-v-bitzer/">427 U.S. 445</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="109520"><a href="/opinion/109520/fitzpatrick-v-bitzer/">96 S.Ct. 2666</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="109520"><a href="/opinion/109520/fitzpatrick-v-bitzer/">49 L.Ed.2d 614</a></span> (1976) (holding that Congress may abrogate states' sovereign immunity when legislating pursuant to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment), controls, thus granting Congress the authority to abrogate the states' immunity in IGRA.  To justify this contention, the tribes assert that IGRA creates both a liberty interest and a property interest in the tribes and their members.  Neither of these claimed interests, however, find support in the Supreme Court's Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p47">
      <span class="num">47</span>
      <p class="indent">The alleged liberty interest, the tribes claim, arises from the Supreme Court's holding in Board of Regents v. Roth, <span class="citation" data-id="108608"><a href="/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/">408 U.S. 564</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="108608"><a href="/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/">92 S.Ct. 2701</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="108608"><a href="/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/">33 L.Ed.2d 548</a></span> (1972).  Stating that the states' input in IGRA is akin to a licensing requirement, the tribes assert that the states' failure to enter a compact operates exactly as an unconstitutional denial of a license.  The alleged property interest likewise is derived from Roth.   What the tribes fail to recognize, however, is that these interests are created only when the claimant has "a legitimate claim of entitlement."  <span class="citation" data-id="108608"><a href="/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/">Id. at 577</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="108608"><a href="/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/">92 S.Ct. at 2709</a></span>.   The tribes' bald assertion that IGRA creates such a claim ignores the discretionary nature of the compacting process envisioned by IGRA.  IGRA does not create an entitlement to operate gambling operations;  rather, it establishes the process and standards by which gambling may be conducted on Indian lands.  Thus, IGRA creates no liberty or property interests and cannot implicate the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

    <div class="num" id="p48">
      <span class="num">48</span>
      <p class="indent">Second, the tribes, noting that Congress' goals in enacting IGRA included "shield[ing] [Indian gaming] from organized crime and other corrupting influences," Sec. 2702(2), assert that Congress necessarily enacted IGRA pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Clause.  The tribes look to the legislative history of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-452, <span class="citation no-link">84 Stat. 922</span> (1970), to find Congressional reasoning that organized crime burdens interstate commerce.  84 Stat. at 923.  The tribes thus conclude that, since Congress meant to address organized crime by enacting IGRA, it passed IGRA under the Interstate Commerce Clause.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p49">
      <span class="num">49</span>
      <p class="indent">We disagree.  As Sec. 2702(2) makes clear, Congress' concern with organized crime was not that such activities would burden interstate commerce, but rather that prohibition of organized crime would "ensure that the Indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation, and ... assure that gaming is conducted fairly and honestly by both the operator and the players."  Sec.  2702(2).  In addition, Congress wanted to criminalize the involvement of organized crime in order to "promote[ ] tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal government."  Sec.  2702(1).  In analyzing Congress' goals, it is clear that alleviating a supposed burden on interstate commerce was not among them.</p>

The Supreme Court's jurisprudence on the Indian Commerce Clause bolsters our conclusion that Congress enacted IGRA solely under that authority.  See Cotton Petroleum, 490 U.S. at 192, 109 S.Ct. at 1716 ("[T]he central function of the Indian Commerce Clause is to provide Congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs.").</p>

The States held liable under such a congressional enactment are thus not "unconsenting";  they gave their consent all at once, in ratifying the Constitution containing the Commerce Clause, rather than on a case-by-case basis.</p>

Unlike those courts, we refuse to disregard Union Gas merely on these bases.  Nonetheless, when examined in the proper light, Union Gas is distinguishable from the cases before us and does not govern our disposition of this issue.

      <p class="indent">First, the tribes begin their argument by assuming that Union Gas controls all Commerce Clause cases, Indian as well as Interstate;  thus, they assert, we are obligated to hold that Congress successfully abrogated the states' immunity when it passed IGRA.<a class="footnote" href="#fn13" id="fn13_ref">13</a>  We believe it appropriate, however, to limit Union Gas to the factual situation before that Court:  the exercise of Congress' power to legislate under the Interstate Commerce Clause.  CERCLA and SARA were passed pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Clause, not the Indian Commerce Clause.  In addition, each of the opinions--plurality, concurrences, and dissents--addressed only the Interstate Commerce Clause.  Moreover, the opinions do not suggest that the Union Gas holding should be broadly construed.  Thus, a fair reading of Union Gas is one that limits Congress' abrogation powers to laws passed under the Interstate Commerce Clause.  As we already have determined that IGRA was passed pursuant to the Indian Commerce Clause, the Union Gas holding does not control our disposition of this case.</p>

      <p class="indent">This conclusion is bolstered by the unique qualities that distinguish the Interstate Commerce Clause and the Indian Commerce Clause.  In an attempt to demonstrate this point, defendants suggest that Cotton Petroleum Corp. v.

That case, which dealt solely with preemption and multiple taxation issues, plainly is distinguishable from the facts before us;  thus, the Cotton Petroleum Court's conclusion that the Commerce Clause distinguishes between states and Indian tribes is neither surprising nor controlling precedent.  Although not directly on point, however, much of the reasoning that supported Cotton Petroleum sheds light on the present issue.  In that case, the Court acknowledged the plenary powers under the Interstate Commerce Clause that allow Congress to place limits on the states in order to "maintain[ ] free trade among the States."  <span class="citation" data-id="112249"><a href="/opinion/112249/cotton-petroleum-corp-v-new-mexico/">Id.</a></span>  By contrast, "the central function of the Indian Commerce Clause is to provide Congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs."  <span class="citation" data-id="112249"><a href="/opinion/112249/cotton-petroleum-corp-v-new-mexico/">Id.</a></span>  Although Congress has the power to limit the states under the Indian Commerce Clause as well, the different purposes underlying the two clauses mandate that they be treated distinctly.  As a result, the unique abrogation power afforded Congress under the Interstate Commerce Clause in Union Gas cannot be extended to the Indian Commerce Clause.</p>

      <p class="indent">A second argument supporting our conclusion that Congress did not possess the power to abrogate the states' immunity is that a proper reading of Union Gas and the cases cited therein demonstrates that the Court has allowed federal jurisdiction over states only when the states partake in an activity typical of private individuals.  For instance, in Parden, a case on which the Union Gas plurality primarily relied, the State of Alabama was operating a for-profit railroad in interstate commerce.  Likewise, in Union Gas itself, the State of Pennsylvania was an "owner or operator" of land and therefore, like private citizens, was subject to liability under SARA.  On the contrary, when the State of Missouri operated a non-proprietary, not-for-profit hospital (a non-private activity "wholly within [the states'] sphere of authority"), the Court refused to find that Congress mandated federal jurisdiction.  Employees, <span class="citation" data-id="108763"><a href="/opinion/108763/employees-v-missouri-public-health-dept/">411 U.S. at 282</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="108763"><a href="/opinion/108763/employees-v-missouri-public-health-dept/">93 S.Ct. at 1617</a></span>.</p>

    <div class="num" id="p61">
      <span class="num">61</span>
      <p class="indent">In this case, the tribes seek to impose jurisdiction over the States of Alabama and Florida for their failure to negotiate a compact with the tribes.  Rather than being a typically private activity, such negotiations are "wholly within [the states'] sphere of authority."   We believe the Supreme Court's jurisprudence clearly evinces an intent to allow federal jurisdiction over states only when the state's conduct is outside the typical realm of state authority.  As negotiations with tribes certainly are not outside that realm of authority, the principles of federalism and sovereign immunity exemplified in the Eleventh Amendment prevent Congress from abrogating the states' immunity.  Thus, even if Union Gas' reasoning were to give Congress abrogation power under the Indian Commerce Clause in general, we would hold that Congress may not abrogate when it legislates in an area typically reserved to the states (such as negotiating regulations with Indian tribes).</p>

      <p class="indent">Third, the Supreme Court has created a third exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity by holding that the Eleventh Amendment does not always provide immunity to government officials;  in certain circumstances, those officials may be subject to suit, despite the Eleventh Amendment, under the "fiction" of Ex parte Young, <span class="citation" data-id="96819"><a href="/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/">209 U.S. 123</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="96819"><a href="/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/">28 S.Ct. 441</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="96819"><a href="/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/">52 L.Ed. 714</a></span> (1908).  Briefly, the fiction allows an individual to obtain a federal injunction against a state officer to force the officer to comply with federal law.  <span class="citation" data-id="96819"><a href="/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/">Id. at 160</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="96819"><a href="/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/">28 S.Ct. at 454</a></span>.   Under the fiction, the tribes assert that they may sue the governors of Alabama and Florida to compel negotiations under IGRA.</p>

    <div class="num" id="p64">
      <span class="num">64</span>
      <p class="indent">The Ex parte Young doctrine does not apply in two cases:  (1) it cannot be used to compel an executive official to undertake a discretionary task;  and (2) it cannot be used if the suit is, in reality, against the state.  As most of the courts that have addressed this issue have found, however, the tribes' claims fit into both categories.  See, e.g., Poarch II, <span class="citation" data-id="1907681"><a href="/opinion/1907681/poarch-band-of-creek-indians-v-state-of-ala/">784 F.Supp. at 1551-52</a></span>;  Poarch I, <span class="citation" data-id="2341082"><a href="/opinion/2341082/poarch-band-of-creek-indians-v-state-of-ala/">776 F.Supp. at 562</a></span>;  and Ponca, supra.<a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref">14</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p65">
      <span class="num">65</span>
      <p class="indent">First, the Ex parte Young doctrine cannot compel discretionary acts.  Ex parte Young, <span class="citation" data-id="96819"><a href="/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/">209 U.S. at 158</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="96819"><a href="/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/">28 S.Ct. at 453</a></span>.   IGRA does not allot merely ministerial acts to the state, however;  rather, it provides for the negotiation of a contract, the terms of which are left to the discretion of the state and the tribe.  Likewise, since IGRA provides a procedure should the state decide not to negotiate, even the mere question of whether the state should negotiate at all is subject to discretion.  Thus, both of these facets of IGRA's compacting process demonstrate that the governors must use their discretion;  accordingly, under the first exception to the Ex parte Young doctrine, the governors retain their Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p66">
      <span class="num">66</span>
      <p class="indent">Second, if a suit in reality is against the state itself, the Ex parte Young doctrine is inapplicable.  Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, <span class="citation" data-id="111094"><a href="/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/">465 U.S. 89</a></span>, 101-02, <span class="citation" data-id="111094"><a href="/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/">104 S.Ct. 900</a></span>, 908-09, <span class="citation" data-id="111094"><a href="/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/">79 L.Ed.2d 67</a></span> (1984).  IGRA uniformly addresses itself to "the State";  not once does it impose duties or responsibilities on a particular officer of the state (e.g., the governor, the legislature, etc.).  Even the district court's injunctive relief powers are limited to ordering "the State and the Indian Tribe to conclude" a compact.  Sec.  2710(d)(7)(B)(iii) (emphasis added).  In addition, IGRA mandates that the State negotiate, conclude, and abide by the Tribal-State compact.  It is apparent that these suits are not against officials in an attempt to force them to follow federal law;  rather, the suits are against the states for failing to negotiate a compact in good faith.  As a result, the doctrine of Ex parte Young does not apply.</p>

    <div class="num" id="p67">
      <span class="num">67</span>
      <p class="indent">Unless one of the three exceptions--consent, abrogation, or Ex parte Young--applies, the Eleventh Amendment serves as a jurisdictional bar and precludes federal court adjudication over these suits.  As we have found that none of the exceptions is applicable to IGRA, these cases must be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>

      <span class="num">68</span>
      <p class="indent">As a result of our holding that the federal courts do not have jurisdiction to reach the issues brought by the tribes in these two suits, the procedures found in Secs. 2710(d)(7)(A)(i) and (B)(i)-(vi) necessarily fail when an unconsenting state refuses to consent to suit.<a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref">15</a></p>

    <div class="num" id="p69">
      <span class="num">69</span>
      <p class="indent">The final question we must resolve is whether all provisions for state involvement in class III gaming also fail, as the tribes contend.  We hold that they do not.  IGRA contains an explicit severability clause, Sec. 2721;  and we find no "strong evidence" to ignore that plain congressional directive.  See Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, <span class="citation" data-id="111847"><a href="/opinion/111847/alaska-airlines-inc-v-brock/">480 U.S. 678</a></span>, 686, <span class="citation" data-id="111847"><a href="/opinion/111847/alaska-airlines-inc-v-brock/">107 S.Ct. 1476</a></span>, 1481, <span class="citation" data-id="111847"><a href="/opinion/111847/alaska-airlines-inc-v-brock/">94 L.Ed.2d 661</a></span> (1987).  Nevertheless, we are left with the question as to what procedure is left for an Indian tribe faced with a state that not only will not negotiate in good faith, but also will not consent to suit.  The answer, gleaned from the statute, is simple.  One hundred and eighty days after the tribe first requests negotiations with the state, the tribe may file suit in district court.  If the state pleads an Eleventh Amendment defense, the suit is dismissed, and the tribe, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. Sec. 2710(d)(7)(B)(vii), then may notify the Secretary of the Interior of the tribe's failure to negotiate a compact with the state.  The Secretary then may prescribe regulations governing class III gaming on the tribe's lands.  This solution conforms with IGRA and serves to achieve Congress' goals, as delineated in Secs. 2701-02.</p>
