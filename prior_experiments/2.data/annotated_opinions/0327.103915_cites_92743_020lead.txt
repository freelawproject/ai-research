Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 134. The fixing of prices, like other applications of the police power, may reduce the value of the property which is being regulated. But the fact that the value is reduced does not mean that the regulation is invalid. Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135, 155-157; Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502, 523-539 and cases cited. It does, however, indicate that “fair value” is the end product of the process of rate-making not the starting point as the Circuit Court of Appeals held. The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to depend upon “fair value” when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated. 9 *602 We held in Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of for-mulae in determining rates. Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of “pragmatic adjustments.” Id., p. 586. And when the Commission’s order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order “viewed in its entirety” meets the requirements of the Act. Id., p. 686. Under the statutory standard of “just and reasonable” it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling. Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 289 U. S. 287, 304-305, 314; West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No.

Moreover, the Commission’s order does not become suspect by reason of the fact that it is challenged. It is the product of expert judgment which carries a presumption of validity. And he who would upset the rate order under the Act carries the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences. Cf. Railroad Commission v. Cumberland Tel. & T. Co., 212 U. S. 414; Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, pp. 164, 169; Railroad Commission v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., 302 U. S. 388, 401. *603 The rate-making process under the Act, i. e., the fixing of “just and reasonable” rates, involves a balancing of the investor and the consumer interests. Thus we stated in the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. case that “regulation does not insure that the business shall produce net revenues.” 315 U. S. p. 590. But such considerations aside, the investor interest has a legitimate concern with the financial integrity of the company whose rates are being regulated. From the investor or company point of view it is important that there be enough revenue not only for operating expenses but also for the capital costs of the business. These include service on the debt and dividends on the stock.

on the average investment. It asked for no rate increases. Its properties were well maintained and operated. As the Commission says, such a modest rate of 3.27% suggests an “inflation of the base on which the rate has been computed.” Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 292 U. S. 290, 312. Cf. Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 164. The incongruity between the actual operations and the return computed on the basis of reproduction cost suggests that the Commission was wholly justified in rejecting the latter as the measure of the rate base. In view of this disposition of the controversy we need not stop to inquire whether the failure of the Commission to add the $17,000,000 of well-drilling and other costs to *606 the rate base was consistent with the prudent investment theory as developed and applied in particular cases. Only a word need be added respecting depletion and depreciation. We held in the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. case that there was no constitutional requirement “that the owner who embarks in a wasting-asset business of limited life shall receive at the end more than he has put into it.” 315 U. S. p. 593. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not think that that rule was applicable here because Hope was a utility required to continue its service to the public and not scheduled to end its business on a day certain as was stipulated to be true of the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. But that distinction is quite immaterial. The ultimate exhaustion of the supply is inevitable in the case of all natural gas companies. Moreover, this Court recognized in Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, the propriety of basing annual depreciation on cost. 10 By such a procedure the utility is made whole and the integrity of its investment maintained. 11 No more is required. 12 We cannot approve the contrary holding *607 of United Railways Co. v. West, 280 U. S. 234, 253-254. Since there are no constitutional requirements more exacting than the standards of the Act, a rate order which conforms to the latter does not run afoul of the former. The Position of West Virginia. The State of West Virginia, as well as its Public Service Commission, intervened in the proceedings before the Commission and participated in the hearings before it.

709, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2. In accomplishing that purpose the bill was designed to take “no authority from State commissions ” and was “so drawn as to complement and in no manner usurp State regulatory authority.” Id., p. 2. And the Federal Power Commission was given no authority over the “production or gathering of natural gas.” § 1 (b). The primary aim of this legislation was to protect consumers against exploitation at the hands of natural gas companies. Due to the hiatus in regulation which resulted from the Kansas Gas Co. case and related decisions state commissions found it difficult or impossible to discover what it cost interstate pipe-line companies to deliver gas within the consuming states; and thus they were thwarted in local regulation. H. Rep. No. 709, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 3. Moreover, the investigations of the Federal Trade Commission had disclosed that the majority of the pipeline mileage in the country used to transport natural gas, together with an increasing percentage of the natural gas supply for pipe-line transportation, had been acquired by a handful of holding companies. 17 State commissions, independent producers, and communities having or seeking the service were growing quite helpless against these combinations. 18 These were the types of problems with which those participating in the hearings were preoccupied. 19 Congress addressed itself to those specific evils. *611 The Federal Power Commission was given broad powers of regulation. The fixing of “just and reasonable” rates (§4) with the powers attendant thereto 20 was the heart of the new regulatory system.

But it is said that the Commission placed too low a rate on gas for industrial purposes as compared with gas for domestic purposes and that industrial uses should be discouraged. It should be noted in the first place that the rates which the Commission has fixed are Hope’s interstate wholesale rates to distributors, not interstate rates to industrial users 27 and domestic consumers. We hardly *616 can assume, in view of the history of the Act and its provisions, that the resales intrastate by the customer companies which distribute the gas to ultimate consumers in Ohio and Pennsylvania are subject to the rate-making powers of the Commission. 28 But in any event those rates are not in issue here. Moreover, we fail to find in the power to fix “just and reasonable” rates the power to fix rates which will disallow or discourage resales for industrial use. The Committee Report stated that the Act provided “for regulation along recognized and more or less standardized lines” and that there was “nothing novel in its provisions.” H. Rep. No. 709, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 3. Yet if we are now to tell the Commission to fix the rates so as to discourage particular uses, we would indeed be injecting into a rate case a “novel” doctrine which has no express statutory sanction. The same would be true if we were to hold that the wasting-asset nature of the industry required the maintenance of the level of rates so that natural gas companies could make a greater profit on each unit of gas sold. Such theories of rate-making for this industry may or may not be desirable. The difficulty is that § 4 (a) and § 5 (a) contain only the conventional standards of rate-making for natural gas companies. 29 The *617 Act of February 7,1942, by broadening § 7 gave the Commission some additional authority to deal with the conservation aspects of the problem. 30 But § 4 (a) and § 5 (a) were hot changed.

It was there pointed out that where “the order sought to be reviewed does not of itself adversely affect complainant-hut’ only affects his rights adversely on the contingency of future administrative action,” it is not reviewable. Id., p. 130. The Court said, “In view of traditional conceptions of federal judicial power, resort to the courts in these situations is either premature or wholly beyond their province.” Id., p. 130. And see United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., 273 U. S. 299, 309, 310; Shannahan v. United States, 303 U. S. 596. These considerations are apposite here. The Commission has no authority to enforce these findings. They are “the exercise solely of the function of investigation.” United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 310. They are only a preliminary, interim step towards possible future action — action not by the Commission but by wholly independent agencies. The outcome of those proceedings may turn on factors other than these findings. These findings may never result in the respondent feeling the pinch of administrative action. Reversed. Mr. Justice Roberts took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. Opinion of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Murphy: We agree with the Court’s opinion and would add nothing to what has been said but for what is patently a wholly gratuitous assertion as to Constitutional law in the dissent of Mr. Justice Frankfurter. We refer to the statement that “Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, may fairly be claimed.” That was the case in which a majority of this Court was finally induced to expand the meaning *620 of “due process” so as to give courts power to block efforts of the state and national governments to regulate economic affairs. The present case does not afford a proper occasion to discuss the soundness of that doctrine because, as stated in Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s dissent, “that issue is not here in controversy.” The salutary practice whereby courts do not discuss issues in the abstract applies with peculiar force to Constitutional questions. Since, however, the dissent adverts to a highly controversial due process doctrine and implies its acceptance by Congress, we feel compelled to say that we do not understand that Congress voluntarily has acquiesced in a Constitutional principle of government that courts, rather than legislative bodies, possess final authority over regulation of economic affairs. Even this Court has not always fully embraced that principle, and we wish to repeat that we have never acquiesced in it, and do not now. See Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., 315 U. S. 575, 599-601. Hope produces about one-third of its annual gas requirements and purchases the rest under some 300 contracts. These five companies are the East Ohio Gas Co., the Peoples Natural Gas Co., the River Gas Co., the Fayette County Gas Co., and the Manufacturers Light & Heat Co.

No. 83, 70th Cong., 1st Sess. S. Doc. 92, Pt. 84-A, chs. XII, XIII, op. cit., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, note 17. See Hearings on H. R. 11662, Subcommittee of House Committee on Interstate & Foreign Commerce, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. ; Hearings on H. R. 4008, House Committee on Interstate & Foreign Commerce, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. The power to investigate and ascertain the “actual legitimate cost” of property (§6), the requirement as to books and records (§8), control over rates of depreciation (§9), the requirements for periodic and special reports (§10), the broad powers of investigation (§ 14) are among the chief powers supporting the rate-making function. Apart from the grandfather clause contained in §7 (c), there is the provision of § 7 (f) that a natural gas company may enlarge or extend its facilities within the “service area” determined by the Commission without any further authorization. See Act of July 7,1943, c. 194, 57 Stat. 383, containing an “Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas” between Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Illinois, Colorado, and Kansas.

The adequacy of these amounts has not been challenged here. The Commission included in the aggregate annual operating expenses which it allowed some $8,500,000 for gas purchased. It also allowed about $1,400,000 for natural gas production and about $600,000 for exploration and development. It is suggested, however, that the Commission in ascertaining the cost of Hope’s natural gas production plant-proceeded contrary to § 1 (b) which provides that the Act shall not apply to "the production or gathering of natural gas.” But such valuation, like the provisions for operating expenses, is essential to the rate-making function as customarily performed in this country. Cf. Smith, The Control of Power Rates in the United States and England (1932), 159 The *615 Annals 101. Indeed § 14 (b) of the Act gives the Commission the power to “determine the propriety and reasonableness of the inclusion in operating expenses, capital, or surplus of all delay rentals or other forms of rental or compensation for unoperated lands and leases.” See note 25, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>. The Commission has expressed doubts over its power to fix rates on “direct sales to industries” from interstate pipelines as distinguished from “sales for resale to the industrial customers of distributing companies.” Annual Report, Federal Power Commission (1940), p. 11. Sec. 1 (b) of the Act provides: “The provisions of this Act shall apply to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use, and to natural-gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale, but shall not apply to any other transportation or sale of natural gas or to the local distribution of natural gas or to the facilities used for such distribution or to the production or gathering of natural gas.” And see §2 (6), defining a “natural-gas company,” and H. Rep. No. 709, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, pp. 2,3. The wasting-asset characteristic of the industry was recognized prior to the Act as requiring the inclusion of a depletion allowance among operating expenses. See Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 292 U. S. 398, 404-405. But no such theory *617 of rate-making for natural gas companies as is now suggested emerged from the cases arising during the earlier period of regulation. The Commission has- been alert to the problems of conservation in its administration of the Act. It has indeed suggested that it might be wise to restrict the use of natural gas “by functions rather than by areas.” Annual Report (1940) p. 79.
