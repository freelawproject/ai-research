**Combined Opinion**
 [7] It is in Kentucky, where all of the material events took place, that the records and witnesses pertinent *494 to petitioner's claim are likely to be found. And that forum is presumably no less convenient for the respondent and the Commonwealth of Kentucky, than for the petitioner.  The expense and risk of transporting the petitioner to the Western District of Kentucky, should his presence at a hearing prove necessary, would in all likelihood be outweighed by the difficulties of transporting records and witnesses from Kentucky to the district where petitioner is confined.  [8] Indeed, respondent makes clear that "on balance, it would appear simpler and less expensive for the State of Kentucky to litigate such questions [as those involved in this case] in one of its own Federal judicial districts." Brief for Respondent 6.  But respondent insists that however the balance of convenience might be struck with reference to the question of venue, the choice of forum is rigidly and jurisdictionally controlled by the provision of § 2241 (a) that "[w]rits of habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district courts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions.  " 28 U. S. C. § 2241 (a) (emphasis supplied).  Relying on our decision in Ahrens v. Clark, <citedDecision>335 U. S. 188</citedDecision> (1948), respondent contendsand the Court of Appeals heldthat the italicized words limit a District Court's habeas corpus jurisdiction to cases where the prisoner seeking relief is confined within its territorial jurisdiction.  Since that interpretation is not compelled either by the language of the statute or by the decision in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> , and since it is fundamentally at odds with the purposes of the statutory scheme, we cannot agree.  The writ of habeas corpus does not act upon the prisoner who seeks relief, but upon the person who holds *495 him in what is alleged to be unlawful custody.  Wales v. Whitney, 114 U. S. 564, 574 (1885).  In the classic statement: "The important fact to be observed in regard to the mode of procedure upon this writ is, that it is directed to, and served upon, not the person confined, but his jailer.  It does not reach the former except through the latter.  The officer or person who serves it does not unbar the prison doors, and set the prisoner free, but the court relieves him by compelling the oppressor to release his constraint.  The whole force of the writ is spent upon the respondent." In the Matter of Jackson, 15 Mich. 417, 439-440 (1867), quoted with approval in Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283, 306 (1944).  See also <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> v. Clark, <citedDecision>335 U. S., at 196-197</citedDecision> (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  Read literally, the language of § 2241 (a) requires nothing more than the court issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian.  So long as the custodian can be reached by service of process, the court can issue a writ "within its jurisdiction" requiring that the prisoner be brought before the court for a hearing on his claim, or requiring that he be released outright from custody, even if the prisoner himself is confined outside the court's territorial jurisdiction.  Nevertheless, there is language in our opinion in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clark, supra</citedDecision> , indicating that the prisoner's presence within the territorial confines of the district is an invariable prerequisite to the exercise of the District Court's habeas corpus jurisdiction.  In <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> , 120 German nationals confined at Ellis Island, New York, pending deportation sought habeas corpus on the principal ground that the removal orders exceeded the President's statutory authority under the Alien Enemy Act of 1798.  *496 They filed their petitions in the District Court for the District of Columbia, naming as respondent the Attorney General of the United States.  Construing the statutory predecessor to § 2241 (a), we held that the phrase, "within their respective jurisdictions," precluded the District Court for the District of Columbia from inquiring into the validity of the prisoners' detention at Ellis Island, and we therefore affirmed the dismissal of the petitions on jurisdictional grounds.  Our decision in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> rested on the view that Congress' paramount concern was the risk and expense attendant to the "production of prisoners from remote sections, perhaps thousands of miles from the District Court that issued the writ.  The opportunities for escape afforded by travel, the cost of transportation, the administrative burden of such an undertaking negate such a purpose." <citedDecision>335 U. S., at 191</citedDecision> .  And we found support for that assumption in the legislative history of the Act.  [9] During the course of Senate debate on the habeas corpus statute of 1867, [10] the bill was criticized on the ground that it would permit "a district judge in Florida to bring before him some men convicted and sentenced and held under imprisonment in the State of Vermont or in any of the further States." Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 2d Sess., 730.  Senator Trumbull, sponsor of the bill, met the objection with an amendment adding the words, "within their respective jurisdictions," as a circumscription of the power of the district courts to issue the writ.  [11] *497 But developments since <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> have had a profound impact on the continuing vitality of that decision.  First, in the course of overruling the application of <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> to the ordinary case where a prisoner attacks the conviction and sentence of a federal or state court, Congress has indicated that a number of the premises which were thought to require that decision are untenable.  A 1950 amendment to the habeas corpus statute requires that a collateral attack on a federal sentence be brought in the sentencing court rather than the district where the prisoner is confined.  28 U. S. C. § 2255 .  Similarly, a prisoner contesting a conviction and sentence of a state court of a State which contains two or more federal judicial districts, who is confined in a district within the State other than that in which the sentencing court is located, has the option of seeking habeas corpus either in the district where he is confined or the district where the sentencing court is located.  28 U. S. C. § 2241 (d).  [12] In enacting these amendments, Congress explicitly recognized the substantial advantages of having these cases resolved in the court which originally imposed the confinement or in the court located nearest the site of the underlying controversy.  [13] And Congress has further *498 challenged the theoretical underpinnings of the decision by codifying in the habeas corpus statute a procedure we sanctioned in Walker v. Johnston, 312 U. S. 275, 284 (1941), whereby a petition for habeas corpus can in many instances be resolved without requiring the presence of the petitioner before the court that adjudicates his claim.  28 U. S. C. § 2243 .  See also United States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205, 222-223 (1952).  [14] This Court, too, has undercut some of the premises of the <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> decision.  Where American citizens confined overseas (and thus outside the territory of any district court) have sought relief in habeas corpus, we have held, if only implicitly, that the petitioners' absence from the district does not present a jurisdictional obstacle to the consideration of the claim.  Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137 (1953), rehearing denied, 346 U. S. 844, 851-852 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); cf. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11 (1955); Hirota v. MacArthur, 338 U. S. 197 , 199 (1948) (DOUGLAS, J., concurring (1949)).  A further, critical development since our decision in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> is the emergence of new classes of prisoners who are able to petition for habeas corpus because of the adoption of a more expansive definition of the "custody" requirement of the habeas statute.  See Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234 (1968); Jones v. Cunningham 371 U. S. 236 (1963).  The overruling of McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934), made it possible for prisoners in custody under one sentence to attack a sentence which they had not yet begun to serve.  And it also enabled a petitioner held in one State to attack a detainer lodged against him by another State.  In such a case, the State holding the prisoner in immediate confinement acts as agent for the demanding *499 State, [15] and the custodian State is presumably indifferent to the resolution of prisoner's attack on the detainer.  Here, for example, the petitioner is confined in Alabama, but his dispute is with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, not the State of Alabama.  Under these circumstances it would serve no useful purpose to apply the <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> rule and require that the action be brought in Alabama.  In fact, a slavish application of the rule would jar with the very purpose underlying the addition of the phrase, "within their respective jurisdictions." We cannot assume that Congress intended to require the Commonwealth of Kentucky to defend its action in a distant State and to preclude the resolution of the dispute by a federal judge familiar with the laws and practices of Kentucky.  [16] See United States ex rel. Meadows v. New York, 426 F. 2d 1176, 1181 (CA2 1970); Word v. North Carolina, 406 F. 2d 352 (CA4 1969).  IV In view of these developments since <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clark</citedDecision> , we can no longer view that decision as establishing an *500 inflexible jurisdictional rule, dictating the choice of an inconvenient forum even in a class of cases which could not have been foreseen at the time of our decision.  [17] Of course, in many instances the district in which petitioners are held will be the most convenient forum for the litigation of their claims.  On the facts of <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> itself, for example, petitioners could have challenged their detention by bringing an action in the Eastern District of New York against the federal officials who confined them in that district.  No reason is apparent why the District of Columbia would have been a more convenient forum, or why the Government should have undertaken the burden of transporting 120 detainees to a hearing in the District of Columbia.  Under these circumstances, traditional principles of venue would have mandated the bringing of the action in the Eastern District of New York, rather than the District of Columbia.  <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clark</citedDecision> stands for no broader proposition.  Since the petitioner's absence from the Western District of Kentucky did not deprive the court of jurisdiction, and since the respondent was properly served in that district, see Strait v. Laird, 406 U. S. 341 (1972); Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U. S. 487 (1971), the court below erred in ordering the dismissal of the petition on jurisdictional grounds.  The judgment of the Court of *501 Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Reversed and remanded.  MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the result.  I concur in the result.  The conclusion the Court reaches is not unexpected when one notes the extraordinary expansion of the concept of habeas corpus effected in recent years.
**Combined Opinion**
 The result in this case is not without its irony.  The petitioner's speedy trial claim follows upon his escape from Kentucky custody after that State, at its expense, had returned the petitioner from California to stand trial in Kentucky.  Had he not escaped, his Kentucky trial would have taken place five years ago.  Furthermore, the petitioner is free to assert his speedy trial claim in the Kentucky courts if and when he is brought to trial there.  *502 And the claim, already strong on the facts here, increases in strength as time goes by.  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE POWELL concur, dissenting.  Today the Court overrules Ahrens v. Clark, <citedDecision>335 U. S. 188</citedDecision> (1948), which construed the legislative intent of Congress in enacting the lineal predecessor of 28 U. S. C. § 2241 .  Although considerations of "convenience" may support the result reached in this case, those considerations are, in this context, appropriate for Congress, not this Court, to make.  Congress has not legislatively overruled <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> , and subsequent "developments" are simply irrelevant to the judicial task of ascertaining the legislative intent of Congress in providing, in 1867, that federal district courts may issue writs of habeas corpus "within their respective jurisdictions" for prisoners in the custody of state authorities.  The Court, however, not only accomplishes a feat of judicial prestidigitation but, without discussion or analysis, explicitly extends the scope of Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), and implicitly rejects Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886).  I In order to appreciate the full impact of the Court's decision, a brief reiteration of the procedural stance of the case at the time the petition for habeas corpus was filed is necessary.  Petitioner is incarcerated in Alabama pursuant to a state court judgment, the validity of which petitioner does not attack.  Petitioner had been indicted in Kentucky and a detainer filed by Kentucky authorities with the Alabama authorities.  Kentucky had conducted no proceedings against petitioner; no judgment of conviction on the Kentucky indictment had been obtained.  From Alabama, petitioner requested Kentucky authorities to ask the Alabama authorities to deliver *503 him to Kentucky so that petitioner could be tried on the Kentucky indictment.
**Combined Opinion**
 The situations in which pretrial or preconviction federal interference by way of habeas corpus with state criminal processes is justified involve the lack of jurisdiction, under the Supremacy Clause, for the State to bring any criminal charges against the petitioner.  Wildenhus's Case, 120 U. S. 1 (1887); In re Loney, 134 U. S. 372 (1890); In re Neagle, 135 U. S. 1 (1890).  The effect of today's ruling that federal habeas corpus prior to trial is appropriate because it will determine the validity of custody that may be imposed in actuality only sometime in the indefinite future constitutes an unjustifiable federal interference with the judicial administration of a State's criminal laws.  The use of federal habeas corpus is, presumably, limited neither to the interstate detainer situation nor to the constitutional rights secured by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The same reasoning would apply to a state prisoner who alleges that "future custody" will result because the State plans to introduce at a criminal trial sometime in the future a confession allegedly obtained in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, or evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  I thoroughly disagree with this conversion of federal habeas corpus into a pretrial-motion forum for state prisoners.  *509 III In addition to sanctioning an expansion of when a federal court may interfere with state judicial administration, the Court overrules <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clark, supra</citedDecision> , and expands the parameters of which federal courts may so intervene.  In <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> , the Court held that "the presence within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court of the person detained is [a] prerequisite to filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus.  " <citedDecision>335 U. S., at 189</citedDecision> .  The Court construed the phrase "within their respective jurisdictions" to mean that Congress intended to limit the jurisdiction of a district court to prisoners in custody within its territorial jurisdiction.  <citedDecision>Id., at 193</citedDecision> .  The Court here says that the "language" of <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> "indicates" the result reached below.  The explicit holding of the Court, however, is plainly much more than an "indication." "Thus the view that the jurisdiction of the District Court to issue the writ in cases such as this is restricted to those petitioners who are confined or detained within the territorial jurisdiction of the court is supported by the language of the statute, by considerations of policy, and by the legislative history of the enactment.  We therefore do not feel free to weigh the policy considerations which are advanced for giving district courts discretion in cases like this.  If that concept is to be imported into this statute, Congress must do so. " <citedDecision>Id., at 192-193</citedDecision> (emphasis added; footnote omitted).  The result reached today may be desirable from the point of view of sound judicial administration, see <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clark, supra, at 191</citedDecision> ; Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224 , 228 n. 5 (1970).  It is the function of this Court, however, to ascertain the intent of Congress as to the meaning *510 of "within their respective jurisdictions." Having completed that task in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> , it is the function of Congress to amend the statute if this Court misinterpreted congressional intent or if subsequent developments suggest the desirability, from a policy viewpoint, of alterations in the statute.  See Cleveland v. United States, 329 U. S. 14 (1946).  We noted in Nelson that the resolution of any apparent dilemma "caused" by this Court's holding in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> is appropriately one to be undertaken by Congress.  399 U. S., at 228 n. 5.  Legislative "inaction" in amending a statute to comport with this Court's evaluation of "[s]ound judicial administration" hardly warrants the disingenuous reading of a previous decision to achieve the result that Congress, despite judicial prodding, has refused to mandate.  However impatient we may be with a federal statute which sometimes may fail to provide a remedy for every situation, one would have thought it inappropriate for the Court to amend the statute by judicial action.  The Court lists several "developments" that have somehow undercut the validity, in the Court's opinion, of the statutory interpretation of the phrase "within their respective jurisdictions." As the amended § 2255 is relevant only to federal prisoners collaterally attacking a conviction, and as § 2241 (d) applies only to intrastate jurisdiction, the relevance of the amendments with respect to the jurisdictional requirement of § 2241 (c) (3) is not a little obscure.  The interpretation of the phrase "within their respective jurisdictions" in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> is hardly incompatible with these recent amendments of statutes dealing with situations not involving the interstate transportation of state prisoners.  The further argument that Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137 (1953), "undermines" <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> overlooks the fact that the Court in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> specifically reserved that question, <citedDecision>335 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> n. 4, the resolution of which is by no means an explicit rejection *511 of <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> .  Finally, the fact that this Court has expanded the notion of "custody" for habeas corpus purposes hardly supports, much less compels, the rejection of a statutory construction of an unrelated phrase.  In the final analysis, the Court apparently reasons that since Congress amended other statutory provisions dealing with habeas corpus, therefore the congressional intent with respect to the meaning of an unamended phrase must somehow have changed since the Court previously ascertained that intent.  This approach to statutory construction, however, justifies with as much, if not more, force, the result reached below: Congress, aware of this Court's interpretation of the phrase in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> , deliberately chose not to amend § 2241 (c) (3) when it selectively amended other statutory provisions dealing with federal habeas corpus.  Indeed, the most recent indications of legislative intent support this conclusion rather than that advanced by the Court. See H. R. Rep. No. 1894, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 1-2 (1966); S. Rep. No. 1502, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966).  See also n. 13, ante, at 497.  I would adhere to this Court's interpretation of the legislative intent set forth in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clark, supra</citedDecision> , and leave it to Congress, during the process of considering legislation to amend this section, to consider and to weigh the various policy factors that the Court today weighs for itself.

Id., at 383 .  But that case arose on direct review of the denial of relief by the state court, and we had no occasion to consider whether the same or similar claims could have been raised on federal habeas corpus.
**Combined Opinion**
 [14]  See Note, Developments in the LawFederal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038 , 1189-1191 (1970).  [15]  Nothing in this opinion should be taken to preclude the exercise of concurrent habeas corpus jurisdiction over the petitioner's claim by a federal district court in the district of confinement.  But as we have made clear above, that forum will not in the ordinary case prove as convenient as the district court in the State which has lodged the detainer.  Where a prisoner brings an action in the district of confinement attacking a detainer lodged by another State, the court can, of course, transfer the suit to a more convenient forum.  28 U. S. C. § 1404 (a).  Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U. S. 335 (1960).  [16]  Obviously, since petitioner could not have presented his habeas corpus claim prior to our 1968 decision in Peyton v. Rowe, supra , and since the choice-of-forum provisions in the habeas corpus statute were most recently amended in 1966, see n. 13, supra, we can hardly draw any inference from the fact that the amendment did not specifically overrule <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> with respect to the type of case now before us.  [17]  In Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224 , 228 n. 5 (1970), we adverted to, but reserved judgment on, the precise question at issue here.  We did point out, however, that the "obvious, logical, and practical solution is an amendment to § 2241 to remedy the shortcoming that has become apparent following the holding in Peyton v. Rowe .  Sound judicial administration calls for such an amendment." We note that an amendment to § 2241 drafted by the Administrative Conference of the United States Courts was introduced during the 92d Congress, but no action was taken upon it.
