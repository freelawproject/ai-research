 Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, § 1101 (a) (Supp. 1976).  In 1972, 18 also was established as the age of majority for males and females in civil matters, Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, § 13 (1972 and Supp. 1976), except that §§241 and 245 of the 3.2% beer statute were simultaneously codified to create an exception to the gender-free rule.  Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that Reed emphasized that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are “subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.” 404 U. S., at 75 .  To withstand constitutional challenge, previous cases establish that classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.  Thus, in Reed , the ob *198 jectives of “reducing the workload on probate courts,” id., at 76 , and “avoiding intrafamily controversy,” id., at 77 , were deemed of insufficient importance to sustain use of an overt gender criterion in the appointment of administrators of intestate decedents’ estates.  Decisions following Reed similarly have rejected administrative ease and convenience as sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-based classifications.  See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 656 (1972); Frontiero v. Richardson, <citedDecision>411 U. S. 677, 690</citedDecision> (1973); cf. Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498, 506-507 (1975).  And only two Terms ago, Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7 (1975), expressly stating that Reed v. Reed was “controlling,” 421 U. S., at 13 , held that Reed required invalidation of a Utah differential age-of-majority statute, notwithstanding the statute’s coincidence with and furtherance of the State’s purpose of fostering “old notions” of role typing and preparing boys for their expected performance in the economic and political worlds.  421 U. S., at 14-15 .  6 Reed v. Reed has also provided the underpinning for decisions that have invalidated statutes employing gender as an inaccurate proxy for other, more germane bases of classification.  Hence, “archaic.  and overbroad” generalizations, Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra, at 508 , concerning the financial position of servicewomen, <citedDecision>Frontiero</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Richardson, supra,</citedDecision> at 689 n. 23, and working women, Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 643 (1975), could not justify use of a gender line in determining eligibility for certain governmental entitlements.  Similarly, increasingly outdated *199 misconceptions concerning the role of females in the home rather than in the “marketplace and world of ideas” were rejected as loose-fitting characterizations incapable of supporting state statutory schemes that were premised upon their accuracy.  Stanton v. Stanton, supra; Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 , 535 n. 17 (1975).  In light of the weak congruence between gender and the characteristic or trait that gender purported to represent, it was necessary that the legislatures choose either to realign their substantive laws in a gender-neutral fashion, or to adopt procedures for identifying those instances where the sex-centered generalization actually comported with fact.  See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, supra, at 658 ; cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U. S. 632, 650 (1974).  In this case, too, “Reed, we feel, is controlling ...,” Stanton v. Stanton, supra, at 13 .  We turn then to the question whether, under Reed , the difference between males and females with respect to the purchase of 3.2% beer warrants the differential in age drawn by the Oklahoma statute.

 This survey drew no correlation between the accident figures for any age group and levels of intoxication found in those killed or injured.  For an analysis of the results of this exhibit, see n. 16, infra.  The FBI made no attempt to relate these arrest figures either to beer drinking or to an 18-21 age differential, but rather found that male arrests for all ages exceeded 90% of the total.  Obviously, arrest statistics do not embrace all individuals who drink and drive.  But for purposes of analysis, this "underinclusiveness” must be discounted somewhat by the shortcomings inherent in this statistical sample, see n. 14, infra.  In any event, we decide this case in light of the evidence offered by Oklahoma and know of no way of extrapolating these arrest statistics to take into account the driving and drinking population at large, including those who avoided arrest.  For example, we can conjecture that in Reed , Idaho’s apparent premise that women lacked experience in formal business matters (particularly compared to men) would have proved to be accurate in substantially more than 2% of all cases. And in both <citedDecision>Frontiero</citedDecision> and Wiesenfeld , we expressly found appellees’ empirical defense of mandatory dependency tests for men but not women to be unsatisfactory, even though we recognized that husbands are still far less likely to be dependent on their wives than vice versa.  See, e. g., <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 688-690</citedDecision> .  The very social stereotypes that find reflection in age-differential laws, see Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S., 7, 14-15 (1975), are likely substantially to distort the accuracy of these comparative statistics.  Hence “reckless” young men who drink and drive are transformed into arrest statistics, whereas their female counterparts are chivalrously escorted home.  See, e. g., W. Reckless & B. Kay, The Female Offender 4, 7, 13, 16-17 (Report to Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, 1967).  Moreover, the Oklahoma surveys, gathered under a regime where the age-differential law in question has been in effect, are lacking in controls necessary for appraisal of the actual effectiveness of the male 3.2% beer prohibition.  In this regard, the disproportionately high arrest statistics for young males — and, indeed, the growing alcohol-related arrest figures for all ages and sexes — simply may be taken to document the relative futility of controlling driving behavior by the 3.2% beer *203 statute and like legislation, although we obviously have no means of estimating how many individuals, if any, actually were prevented from drinking by these laws.  See, e. g., nn. 9 and 11, supra. See also n. 16, infra.
