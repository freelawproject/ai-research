<p>The defendant's Counsel (Rawle), observed.</p>
<p>The plaintiff's Counsel (M. Levy) answered.</p>
<p><span class="star-pagination">*214</span> BY THE COURT: Â— It is plain, that the action, in its present form, cannot be supported. Under the act of Assembly, nothing but debts are assigned, or assignable; and torts must be considered as the mere personal concern of the bankrupt.</p>
<p>Let Judgment be entered for the defendant.</p>
