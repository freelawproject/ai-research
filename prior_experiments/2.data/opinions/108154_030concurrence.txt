<author id="b311-6">Mr. Justice Stewart,</author>
<p id="AZp">concurring.</p>
<p id="b311-7">When <em>Sinclair Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>370 U. S. 195, was decided in 1962, I subscribed to the opinion of the Court. Before six years had passed I had reached the conclusion that the <em>Sinclair </em>holding should be reconsidered, and said so in <em>Avco Corp. </em>v. <em>Aero Lodge 735, </em>390 U. S. 557, 562 (concurring opinion). Today I join the Court in concluding “that <em>Sinclair </em>was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity.”</p>
<p id="b311-8">In these circumstances the temptation is strong to embark upon a lengthy personal <em>apologia. </em>But since Mr. Justice Brennan has so clearly stated my present views in his opinion for the Court today, I simply join in that opinion and in the Court’s judgment. An aphorism of Mr. Justice Frankfurter provides me refuge: “Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.” <em>Henslee </em>v. <em>Union Planters Bank, </em>335 U. S. 595, 600 (dissenting opinion).</p>
