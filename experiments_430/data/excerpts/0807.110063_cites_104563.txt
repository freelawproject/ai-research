 10 The statute clearly relied on the Geer state-control-of-ownership rationale.  11 Anyone lawfully taking shrimp from Louisiana waters was granted “a qualified interest which may be sold within the State.” Only after the head and shell *333 had been removed within the State did the taker or possessor acquire “title and the right to sell and ship the same ‘beyond the limit[s] of the State, without restriction or reservation.’ ” 278 U. S., at 8 .  Ignoring the niceties of “title” to the shrimp and concentrating instead on the purposes and effects of the statute, Foster-Fountain Packing struck down the statute as economic protectionism abhorrent to the Commerce Clause.  The analysis resembled that employed in the natural gas cases, which were cited with approval, id., at 10-11, 13 .  12 Geer was distinguished on the ground that there “[n]o part of the game was permitted by the statute to become an article of interstate commerce.” 278 U. S., at 12 .  13 Limiting Geer to cases involving complete embargoes on interstate commerce in a wild animal created the anomalous result that the most burdensome laws enjoyed the most protection from Commerce Clause attack.  Foster-Fountain Packing’s implicit shift away from Geer’s formalistic “ownership” analysis became explicit in Toomer v. Witsell, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 385, 402</citedDecision> (1948), which struck down as violations of the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and *334 Immunities Clause certain South Carolina laws discriminating against out-of-state commercial fishermen: “The whole ownership theory, in fact, is now generally regarded as but a fiction expressive in legal shorthand of the importance to its people that a State have power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of an important resource.  And there is no necessary conflict between that vital policy consideration and the constitutional command that the State exercise that power, like its other powers, so as not to discriminate without reason against citizens of other States.” Although stated in reference to the Privileges and Immunities Clause challenge, this reasoning is equally applicable to the Commerce Clause challenge.  14 Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 (1977), dispelled any doubts on that score.  In rejecting the argument that Virginia’s “ownership” of fish swimming in its territorial waters empowered the State to forbid fishing by federally licensed ships owned by nonresidents while permitting residents to fish, Seacoast Products explicitly embraced the analysis of the Geer dissenters: “A State does not stand in the same position as the owner of a private game preserve and it is pure fantasy to talk of 'owning’ wild fish, birds, or animals.  Neither the States nor the Federal Government, any more than a hopeful fisherman or hunter, has title to these creatures until they are reduced to possession by skillful capture.... Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519, 539-540 (1896) *335 (Field, J., dissenting).  The 'ownership’ language of cases such as those cited by appellant must be understood as no more than a 19th-century legal fiction expressing 'the importance to its people that a State have power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of an important resource.’ [Citing Toomer.] Under modern analysis, the question is simply whether the State has exercised its police power in conformity with the federal laws and Constitution.” 431 U. S., at 284 .

S. 385</citedDecision> , 402 n. 37 (1948).  “The qualification which forbids [the game’s] removal from the State necessarily entered into and formed part of every transaction on the subject, and deprived the mere sale or exchange of these articles of that element of freedom of contract and of full ownership which is an essential *328 attribute of commerce.  Passing, however, as we do, the decision of this question, and granting that the dealing in game killed within the State, under the provision in question, created internal State commerce, it does not follow that such internal commerce became necessarily the subject-matter of interstate commerce, and therefore under the control of the Constitution of the United States.  "... The power of the State to control the killing of and ownership in game being admitted, the commerce in game, which the state law permitted, was necessarily only internal commerce, since the restriction that it should not become the subject of external commerce went along with the grant and was a part of it.” 161 U. S., at 530-532 .  Our Brother Rehnquist suggests that the Court in Geer offered as an “alternative basis for its decision” (in the final paragraph of its 15-page opinion) that the “State, in the exercise of its police power, could act to preserve for its people a valuable food supply, even though interstate commerce was remotely and indirectly affected.” Post, at 340 n. 3.

 .  .  But by permitting its shrimp to be taken and all the products thereof to be shipped and sold in interstate commerce, the State necessarily releases its hold and, as to the shrimp so taken, definitely terminates its control.  Clearly such authorization and the taking in pursuance thereof put an end to the trust upon which the State is deemed to own or control the shrimp for the benefit of its people.  And those taking the shrimp under the authority of the Act necessarily thereby become entitled to the rights of private ownership and the protection of the commerce clause.” Id., at 13 .  See Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S. 518, 531-532 (1978).  The Court distinguished Geer on the same basis used in Foster-Fountain Packing Co., <citedDecision>334 U. S., at 404-406</citedDecision> .  Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm’n, 334 U.

 Ante, at 329; see West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911).  My objection is that this line of reasoning, while undoubtedly considered important by the majority in Geer , is unnecessary to sustain that decision 3 and is unneeded in the disposition of the pres *341 ent case. And no one — not the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals or the State in this Court — contends that the minnows at issue are not the subjects of interstate commerce.  It is obvious that the Court has simply set this theory up as a sort of strawman to facilitate the toppling of a decision which, in other respects, enunciates principles that have remained valid and vital, albeit somewhat refined, at least until today.  4 The Court in Geer expressed the view derived from Roman law that the wild fish and game located within the territorial limits of a State are the common property of its citizens and that the State, as a kind of trustee, may exercise this common “ownership" for the benefit of its citizens.  161 U. S., at 529 .  Admittedly, a State does not “own” the wild creatures within its borders in any conventional sense of the word.  5 Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra, at 386; Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265, 284 (1977); Toomer v. Witsell, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 385, 401-402</citedDecision> (1948); Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 434 (1920).  But the concept expressed by the “ownership” doctrine is not obsolete.  Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra, at 392 (Burger, C. J., concurring).  This Court long has recognized that the ownership *342 language of Geer and similar cases is simply a shorthand way of describing a State’s substantial interest in preserving and regulating the exploitation of the fish and game and other natural resources within its boundaries for the benefit of its citizens.  436 U. S., at 386 ; Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 284; <citedDecision>Toomer</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Witsell, supra, at 402</citedDecision> .  In recognition of this important state interest, the Court has upheld a variety of regulations designed to conserve and maintain the natural resources of a State.  See, e. g., Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra; Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440 (1960); Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545 (1924); Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U.

To be sure, a State’s power to preserve and regulate wildlife within its borders is not absolute.  6 But the State is accorded wide latitude in fashioning regulations appropriate for protection of its wildlife.  Unless the regulation directly conflicts with a federal statute or treaty, Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 283-285; Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529, 546 (1976); Missouri v. Holland, supra, at 434 ; allocates access in a manner that violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm’n, 334 U. S. 410 (1948); or represents a naked attempt to discriminate against out-of-state enterprises in favor of in-state businesses unrelated to any purpose of conservation, Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1, 13 (1928), the State’s special interest in preserving its wild *343 life should prevail.  And this is true no matter how “Bal-kanized” the resulting pattern of commercial activity.

 This is not a case where a State’s regulation permits residents to export naturally seined minnows but prohibits nonresidents from so doing.  No person is allowed to export natural minnows for sale outside of Oklahoma; the statute is evenhanded in its application.  See Okla. Stat., Tit. 29, § 4r-115 (B) (Supp. 1978).  The State has not used its power to protect its own citizens from outside competition.  See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333 (1977); H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525 (1949).  Nor is this a *345 case where a State requires a nonresident business, as a condition to exporting minnows, to move a significant portion of its operations to the State or to use certain state resources in pursuit of its business for the benefit of the local economy.  See Toomer v. Witsell, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 385</citedDecision> (1948); Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928); Johnson v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 16 (1928); cf. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 145 (1970).  And, notwithstanding the Court’s protestations to the contrary, Oklahoma has not blocked the flow of interstate commerce in minnows at the State’s borders.  See ante, at 336-337.  Appellant, or anyone else, may freely export as many minnows as he wishes, so long as the minnows so transported are hatchery minnows and not naturally seined minnows.  On this record, I simply fail to see how interstate commerce in minnows, the commodity at issue here, is impeded in the least by Oklahoma’s regulatory scheme.  9 Oklahoma does regulate the manner in which both residents and nonresidents procure minnows to be sold outside the State.  But there is no showing in this record that requiring appellant to purchase his minnows from hatcheries instead of from persons licensed to seine minnows from the State’s waters in any way increases appellant’s costs of doing business.

[16] We now conclude that challenges under the Commerce Clause to state regulations of wild animals should be considered according to the same general rule applied to state regulations of other natural resources, and therefore expressly overrule Geer .  We thus bring our analytical framework into conformity with practical realities.  Overruling Geer also eliminates the anomaly, created by the decisions distinguishing Geer , that statutes imposing the most extreme burdens on the interstate commerce (essentially total embargoes) were the most immune from challenge.
