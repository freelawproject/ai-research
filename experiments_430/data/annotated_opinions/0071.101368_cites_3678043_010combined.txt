**Combined Opinion**
 His power to act for his principal was not contingent upon any act or omission of another.  From the verdict we must take it that it was his duty unconditionally to answer the inquiry of petitioner as to the arrival of the goods, and concededly, if acting within the scope of his employment, the respondent would have been liable, however flagrant the agent’s act, had it not been tainted by his selfish motive.  Nelson Business College v. Lloyd, 60 Ohio St. 448 ; Aiken v. Holyoke St. Ry. Co., 184 Mass. 269 .  Binghampton Trust Co. v. Auten, 68 Ark. 299 .  The limitation upon the doctrine of respondeat superior applied by the court below finds little support other than in the passage quoted and in cases, chiefly in some of the *356 lower federal courts, purporting to follow it, see Harris, Irby & Vose v. Allied Compress Co., 6 F. (2d) 7, 9; American Surety Co. v. Pauly, 72 Fed. 470, 482 ; Dun v. City Nat’l Bank, 58 Fed. 174, 179 ; cf. Leachman v. Board of Supervisors, 124 Va. 616, 624 , but in those cases it was not necessary to the decision.  The state courts, including those of Georgia where the cause of action arose, have very generally reached the opposite conclusion, holding that the liability of the principal for the false statement or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope of his authority is unaffected by his secret purpose or motives.  Planters’ Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants’ Nat’l Bank, 78 Ga. 574 ; McCord v. Western Union, 39 Minn. 181 ; Havens v. Bank of Tarboro, <citedDecision>132 N. C. 214</citedDecision> ; Reynolds v. Witte, 13 S. C. 5, 15; Fifth Ave. Bank v. Forty-second St., etc. R. R. Co., 137 N. Y. 231 ; Dougherty v. Wells, Fargo & Co., 7 Nev. 368.  The English courts, after hinting at a departure from the rule as thus stated, British Mutual Banking Co. v. Charnwood Forest Ry., 18 Q. B. D. 714; cf. Barwick v. English Joint Stock Bank, L. R. 2 Ex. 259, 265, have finally reached the same conclusion; Lloyd v. Grace [1912] A. C. 716.  And we think that the restriction of the vicarious liability of the principal adopted by the court below is supported-no more by reason than by authority.  Undoubtedly formal logic may find something to criticize, in a rule which fastens on the principal liability for the acts of his agent, done without the principal’s knowledge or consent and to which his own negligence has not contributed.  But few doctrines of the law are more firmly established or more in harmony with accepted notions of social policy than that of the liability of the principal without fault of his own.  Shaw, C. J. in Farwell v. Boston and Worcester Railroad Corporation, 4 Metc. 49 , 55; Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid, 3 Macq., 266, 283.
