**Lead Opinion**
 Such an abrupt and radical departure from our traditions should not be implied.  See Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U. S. 118, 132 .  Cogent evidence would be necessary to convince us that Congress took that course.  We conclude that the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases do not state the correct rule of law. We are met, however, with the argument that, even though those cases were wrongly decided, Congress has adopted the rule which they announced.  The argument runs as follows: Many efforts were made to amend the law so as to change the rule announced by those cases; but in every instance the bill died in committee.  Moreover, when the Nationality Act of 1940 was passed, Congress reenacted the oath in its pre-existing form, though at the same time it made extensive changes in the requirements and procedure for naturalization.  From this it is argued that Congress adopted and reenacted the rule of the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases. Cf. Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, <citedDecision>310 U. S. 469, 488-489</citedDecision> .  We stated in Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 , that “It would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from reexamining its own doctrines.” It is at best treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law. We do not think under the circumstances of this legislative history that we can properly *70 place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court’s own error.  The history of the 1940 Act is at most equivocal.  It contains no affirmative recognition of the rule of the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases. The silence of Congress and its inaction are as consistent with a desire to leave the problem fluid as they are with an adoption by silence of the rule of those cases. But, for us, it is enough to say that since the date of those cases Congress never acted affirmatively on this question but once and that was in 1942.  At that time, as we have noted, Congress specifically granted naturalization privileges to non-combatants who like petitioner were prevented from bearing arms by their religious scruples.  That was affirmative recognition that one could be attached to the principles of our government and could support and defend it even though his religious convictions prevented him from bearing arms.  And, as we have said, we cannot believe that the oath was designed to exact something more from one person than from another.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The preparation of this measure was not only delegated to a Congressional Committee, but was considered by a committee of Cabinet members, one of whom was the Attorney General.  Both were aware of our decisions in the Schwimmer and related cases and that no other question pertinent to the naturalization laws had been as persistently and continuously before Congress in the ten years following the decision in the Schwimmer case. The modifications in the provisions of Paragraphs “Third” and “Fourth” of § 4 of the 1906 Act show conclusively the careful attention which was given to them.  *76 In the face of this legislative history the "failure of Congress to alter the Act after it had been judicially construed, and the enactment by Congress of legislation which implicitly recognizes the judicial construction as effective, is persuasive of legislative recognition that the judicial construction is the correct one.  This is the more so where, as here, the application of the statute .  .  .  has brought forth sharply conflicting views both on the Court and in Congress, and where after the matter has been fully brought to the attention of the public and the Congress, the latter has not seen fit to change the statute.” Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, <citedDecision>310 U. S. 469, 488-9</citedDecision> .  And see to like effect United States v. Ryan, 284 U. S. 167 -175; United States v. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co., 298 U. S. 492, 500 ; Missouri v. Ross, 299 U. S. 72, 75 ; cf. Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U. S. 79, 82, 83 .  It is the responsibility of Congress, in reenacting a statute, to make known its purpose in a controversial matter of interpretation of its former language, at least when the matter has, for over a decade, been persistently brought to its attention.  In the light of this legislative history, it is abundantly clear that Congress has performed that duty.  In any case it is not lightly to be implied that Congress has failed to perform it and has delegated to this Court the responsibility of giving new content to language deliberately readopted after this Court has construed it.  For us to make such an assumption is to discourage, if not to deny, legislative responsibility.  By thus adopting and confirming this Court’s construction of what Congress had enacted in the Naturalization Act of 1906 Congress gave that construction the same legal significance as though it had written the very words into the Act of 1940.
