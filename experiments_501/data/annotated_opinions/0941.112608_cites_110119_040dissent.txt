 Once the police have *589 luggage “under their exclusive control, there [i]s not the slightest danger that the [luggage] or its contents could [be] removed before a valid search warrant could be obtained.  .  .  .  With the [luggage] safely immobilized, it [i]s unreasonable to undertake the additional and greater intrusion of a search without a warrant” (footnote omitted).  Ibid. Two Terms after Chadwick , we decided a case in which the relevant facts were identical to those before the Court today.  In Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1979), the police had probable cause to search a green suitcase that had been placed in the trunk of a taxicab at the Little Rock Airport.  Several blocks from the airport, they stopped the cab, arrested the passengers, seized the suitcase and, without obtaining a warrant, opened and searched it.  The Arkansas Supreme Court held that the search was unconstitutional.  Relying on Chadwick , the state court had no difficulty in concluding that there was “nothing in this set of circumstances that would lend credence to an assertion of impracticability in obtaining a search warrant.” Sanders v. State, 262 Ark. 595, 600 , 559 S. W. 2d 704, 706 (1977).  Over the dissent of Justice Blackmun and then-JusTiCE Rehnquist, both of whom had also dissented in Chadwick , this Court affirmed.  In his opinion for the Court, Justice Powell noted that the seizure of the green suitcase was entirely proper, 4 but that the State nevertheless had the burden of justifying the warrantless search, 5 and that it had “failed to *590 carry its burden of demonstrating the need for warrantless searches of luggage properly taken from automobiles.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 763</citedDecision> .  Chief Justice Burger wrote separately to identify the distinction between cases in which police have probable cause to believe contraband is located somewhere in a vehicle — the typical automobile exception case — and eases like Chadwick and Sanders in which they had probable cause to search a particular container before it was placed in the car. He wrote: “Because the police officers had probable cause to believe that respondent’s green suitcase contained marihuana before it was placed in the trunk of the taxicab, their duty to obtain a search warrant before opening it is clear under United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977).  The essence of our holding in Chadwick is that there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of a trunk or suitcase accompanying or being carried by a person; that expectation of privacy is not diminished simply because the owner’s arrest occurs in a public place.  Whether arrested in a hotel lobby, an airport, a railroad terminal, or on a public street, as here, the owner has the right to expect that the contents of his luggage will not, without his consent, be exposed on demand of the police.  .  .  .  “The breadth of the Court’s opinion and its repeated references to the ‘automobile’ from which respondent’s suitcase was seized at the time of his arrest, however, might lead the reader to believe — as the dissenters apparently do — that this case involves the ‘automobile’ exception to the warrant requirement.  See ante, at 762-765, and n. 14.  It does not.  Here, as in Chadwick , it was the luggage being transported by respondent at *591 the time of the arrest, not the automobile in which it was being carried, that was the suspected locus of the contraband.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 766-767</citedDecision> (opinion concurring in judgment).  Chief Justice Burger thus carefully explained that Sanders, which the Court overrules today, “simply d[id] not present the question of whether a warrant is required before opening luggage when the police have probable cause to believe contraband is located someiohere in the vehicle, but when they do not know whether, for example, it is inside a piece of luggage in the trunk, in the glove compartment, or concealed in some part of the car’s structure.” Id., at 767.  We confronted that question in United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 (1982).  6 We held in Ross that “the scope of the warrantless search authorized by [the automobile] exception is no broader and no narrower than a magistrate could legitimately authorize by warrant.” See id., at 825 .  The inherent mobility of the vehicle justified the immediate search without a warrant, but did not affect the scope of the search.  See id., at 822 .  Thus, the search could encompass containers, which might or might not conceal the object of the search, as well as the remainder of the vehicle.

 .  (1925).  If, on the other hand, the officer only has probable cause to believe there is contraband in a *595 specific container in the car, he must detain the container and delay his search until a search warrant is obtained.  See United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 .  .  .  (1982); Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753</citedDecision> .  .  .  (1979); United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 .  .  .  (1977).” Castleberry v. State, 678 P. 2d 720, 724 (Okla. 1984).

 Once a lawful search has begun, it is also far more likely that it will not exceed proper bounds when it is done pursuant to a judicial authorization ‘particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.’ Further, a warrant assures the individual whose property is searched or seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer, his need to search, and the limits of his power to search.” Id., at 9.  See id., at 10-11.  The earliest case cited by Chief Justice Burger was Justice Field’s opinion in Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733 (1878).  “Having probable cause to believe that .contraband was being driven away in the taxi, the police were justified in stopping the vehicle, searching it on the spot, and seizing the suitcase they suspected contained contraband.  See Chambers v. Maroney, [ 399 U. S. 42, 52 (1970)].  At oral argument, respondent conceded that the stopping of the taxi and the seizure of the suitcase were constitutionally unobjectionable.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30, 44-46.” <citedDecision>Arkansas</citedDecision> v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 761-762</citedDecision> .  “[B]ecause each exception to the warrant requirement invariably impinges to some extent on the protective purpose of the Fourth Amendment, the few situations in which a search may be conducted in the absence of a warrant have been carefully delineated and ‘the burden is on those *590 seeking the exemption to show the need for it.’ United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48, 51 (1951).” Id., at 759-760.  ’In framing the question for decision we stated: “Unlike Chadwick and Sanders, in this case police officers had probable cause to search respondent’s entire vehicle.” 456 U. S., at 817 .  Moreover, we quoted the following paragraph from Justice Powell’s opinion concurring in the judgment in the intervening case of Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 (1981): “ ‘[W]hen the police have probable cause to search an automobile, rather than only to search a particular container that fortuitously is located in it, the exigencies that allow the police to search the entire automobile without a warrant support the warrantless search of every container found therein.  See post, at 451, and n. 13 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This analysis is entirely consistent with the holdings in Chadwick and Sanders, neither of which is an ‘automobile case,’ because the police there had probable cause to search the double-locked footlocker and the suitcase respectively before either came near an automobile.’ ” Id., at 435, quoted in United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 816 (1982).  Although the Court today purports to acknowledge that the warrant requirement is the general rule, ante, at 580, it nonetheless inexplicably persists in referring to Chadwick and Sanders as announcing a “separate rule, unique to luggage and other closed packages, bags, and containers.” Ante, at 571.
