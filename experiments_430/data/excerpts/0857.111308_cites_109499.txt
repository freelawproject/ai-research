*530 Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court. We revisit in these cases an issue raised in National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976).  In that litigation, this Court, by a sharply divided vote, ruled that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to enforce the minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) against the States “in areas of traditional governmental functions.” <citedDecision>Id., at 852</citedDecision> .  Although <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> supplied some examples of “traditional governmental functions,” it did not offer a general explanation of how a “traditional” function is to be distinguished from a “nontraditional” one.  Since then, federal and state courts have struggled with the task, thus imposed, of identifying a traditional function for purposes of state immunity under the Commerce Clause.  In the present cases, a Federal District Court concluded that municipal ownership and operation of a mass-transit system is a traditional governmental function and thus, under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , is exempt from the obligations imposed by the FLSA.  Faced with the identical question, three Federal Courts of Appeals and one state appellate court have reached the opposite conclusion.  1 *531 Our examination of this “function” standard applied in these and other cases over the last eight years now persuades us that the attempt to draw the boundaries of state regulatory immunity in terms of “traditional governmental function” is not only unworkable but is also inconsistent with established principles of federalism and, indeed, with those very federalism principles on which <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> purported to rest. That case, accordingly, is overruled.  I The history of public transportation in San Antonio, Tex., is characteristic of the history of local mass transit in the United States generally.  Passenger transportation for hire within San Antonio originally was provided on a private basis by a local transportation company.  In 1913, the Texas Legislature authorized the State’s municipalities to regulate vehicles providing carriage for hire.  1913 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 147, § 4, ¶ 12, now codified, as amended, as Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann., Art. 1175, §§ 20 and 21 (Vernon 1963).  Two years later, San Antonio enacted an ordinance setting forth franchising, insurance, and safety requirements for passenger vehicles operated for hire.  The city continued to rely on such publicly regulated private mass transit until 1959, when it purchased the privately owned San Antonio Transit Company and replaced it with a public authority known as the San Antonio Transit System (SATS).

 The application of the FLSA to public schools and hospitals was ruled to be within Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968).  The FLSA obligations of public mass-transit systems like SATS were expanded in 1974 when Congress provided for the progressive repeal of the surviving overtime exemption for mass-transit employees.  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, § 21(b), 88 Stat. 68 .  Congress simultaneously brought the States and their subdivisions further within the ambit of the FLSA by extending FLSA coverage to virtually all state and local-government employees.  §§ 6(a)(1) and (6), 88 Stat. 58 , 60, 29 U. S. C. §§ 203 (d) and (x).  SATS complied with the FLSA’s overtime requirements until 1976, when this Court, in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , overruled Maryland v. Wirtz , and held that the FLSA could not be *534 applied constitutionally to the “traditional governmental functions” of state and local governments.  Four months after <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> was handed down, SATS informed its employees that the decision relieved SATS of its overtime obligations under the FLSA.  3 Matters rested there until September 17, 1979, when the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor issued an opinion that SAMTA’s operations “are not constitutionally immune from the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act” under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  Opinion WH-499, 6 LRR 91:1138.  On November 21 of that year, SAMTA filed this action against the Secretary of Labor in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.  It sought a declaratory judgment that, contrary to the Wage and Hour Administration’s determination, <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> precluded the application of the FLSA’s overtime requirements to SAMTA’s operations.  The Secretary counterclaimed under 29 U. S. C. §217 for enforcement of the overtime and recordkéeping requirements of the FLSA.  On the same day that SAMTA filed its action, appellant Garcia and several other SAMTA employees brought suit against SAMTA in the same District Court for overtime pay under the FLSA.  Garcia v. SAMTA, Civil Action No. SA 79 CA 458.  The District Court has stayed that action pending the outcome of these cases, but it allowed Garcia to intervene in the present litigation as a defendant in support of the Secretary.  One month after SAMTA brought suit, the Department of Labor formally amended its FLSA interpretive regulations to provide that publicly owned local mass-transit systems are not entitled to immunity under *535 <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  44 Fed. Reg. 75630 (1979), codified as 29 CFR § 775.3 (b)(3) (1984).  On November 17, 1981, the District Court granted SAMTA’s motion for summary judgment and denied the Secretary’s and Garcia’s cross-motion for partial summary judgment.  Without further explanation, the District Court ruled that “local public mass transit systems (including [SAMTA]) constitute integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions” under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  App. D to Juris. Statement in No. 82-1913, p. 24a.  The Secretary and Garcia both appealed directly to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1252 .  During the pendency of those appeals, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678 (1982), was decided.  In that case, the Court ruled that commuter rail service provided by the state-owned Long Island Rail Road did not constitute a “traditional governmental function” and hence did not enjoy constitutional immunity, under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , from the requirements of the Railway Labor Act.  Thereafter, it vacated the District Court’s judgment in the present cases and remanded them for further consideration in the light of Long Island.  457 U. S. 1102 (1982).  On remand, the District Court adhered to its original view and again entered judgment for SAMTA.  557 F. Supp. 445 (1983).  The court looked first to what it regarded as the “historical reality” of state involvement in mass transit.  It recognized that States not always had owned and operated mass-transit systems, but concluded that they had engaged in a longstanding pattern of public regulation, and that this regulatory tradition gave rise to an “inference of sovereignty.” Id., at 447-448 .  The court next looked to the record of federal involvement in the field and concluded that constitutional immunity would not result in an erosion of federal authority with respect to state-owned mass-transit systems, because many federal statutes themselves contain exemptions for States and thus make the withdrawal of fed *536 eral regulatory power over public mass-transit systems a supervening federal policy.  Id., at 448-450 .  Although the Federal Government’s authority over employee wages under the FLSA obviously would be eroded, Congress had not asserted any interest in the wages of public mass-transit employees until 1966 and hence had not established a longstanding federal interest in the field, in contrast to the century-old federal regulatory presence in the railroad industry found significant for the decision in Long Island.  Finally, the court compared mass transit to the list of functions identified as constitutionally immune in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and concluded that it did not differ from those functions in any material respect.  The court stated: “If transit is to be distinguished from the exempt [National League of Cities] functions it will have to be by identifying a traditional state function in the same way pornography is sometimes identified: someone knows it when they see it, but they can’t describe it.” 557 F. Supp., at 453 .  4 The Secretary and Garcia again took direct appeals from the District Court’s judgment.  We noted probable jurisdiction.  464 U. S. 812 (1983).  After initial argument, the cases were restored to our calendar for reargument, and the parties were requested to brief and argue the following additional question: “Whether or not the principles of the Tenth Amendment as set forth in National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), should be reconsidered?” 468 U. S. 1213 (1984).  Reargument followed in due course.  *537 II Appellees have not argued that SAMTA is immune from regulation under the FLSA on the ground that it is a local transit system engaged in intrastate commercial activity.  In a practical sense, SAMTA’s operations might well be characterized as “local.” Nonetheless, it long has been settled that Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause extends to intrastate economic activities that affect interstate commerce.  See, e. g., Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 276-277 (1981); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 258 (1964); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 125 (1942); United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941).  Were SAMTA a privately owned and operated enterprise, it could not credibly argue that Congress exceeded the bounds of its Commerce Clause powers in prescribing minimum wages and overtime rates for SAMTA’s employees.  Any constitutional exemption from the requirements of the FLSA therefore must rest on SAMTA’s status as a governmental entity rather than on the “local” nature of its operations.  The prerequisites for governmental immunity under National League of Cities were summarized by this Court in Hodel, supra. Under that summary, four conditions must be satisfied before a state activity may be deemed immune from a particular federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.  First, it is said that the federal statute at issue must regulate “the ‘States as States.’” Second, the statute must “address matters that are indisputably ‘attribute[s] of state sovereignty.’” Third, state compliance with the federal obligation must “directly impair [the States’] ability ‘to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.’ ” Finally, the relation of state and federal interests must not be such that “the nature of the federal interest .  .  .  justifies state submission.” 452 U. S., at 287-288 , and n. 29, quoting National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845, 852, 854</citedDecision> .  *538 The controversy in the present cases has focused on the third Hodel requirement — that the challenged federal statute trench on “traditional governmental functions.” The District Court voiced a common concern: “Despite the abundance of adjectives, identifying which particular state functions are immune remains difficult.” 557 F. Supp., at 447 .  Just how troublesome the task has been is revealed by the results reached in other federal cases. Thus, courts have held that regulating ambulance services, Gold Cross Ambulance v. City of Kansas City, 538 F. Supp. 956, 967-969 (WD Mo. 1982), aff’d on other grounds, 705 F. 2d 1005 (CA8 1983), cert. pending, No. 83-138; licensing automobile drivers, United States v. Best, 573 F. 2d 1095, 1102-1103 (CA9 1978); operating a municipal airport, Amersbach v. City of Cleveland, 598 F. 2d 1033, 1037-1038 (CA6 1979); performing solid waste disposal, Hybud Equipment Corp. v. City of Akron, 654 F. 2d 1187, 1196 (CA6 1981); and operating a highway authority, Molina-Estrada v. Puerto Rico Highway Authority, 680 F. 2d 841, 845-846 (CA1 1982), are functions protected under National League of Cities.  At the same time, courts have held that issuance of industrial development bonds, Woods v. Homes and Structures of Pittsburg, Kansas, Inc., 489 F. Supp. 1270, 1296-1297 (Kan. 1980); regulation of intrastate natural gas sales, Oklahoma ex rel. Derryberry v. FERC, 494 F. Supp. 636, 657 (WD Okla. 1980), aff’d, 661 F. 2d 832 (CA10 1981), cert. denied sub nom. Texas v. FERC, 457 U. S. 1105 (1982); regulation of traffic on public roads, Friends of the Earth v. Carey, 552 F. 2d 25, 38 (CA2), cert. denied, 434 U. S. 902 (1977); regulation of air transportation, Hughes Air Corp. v. Public Utilities Comm’n of Cal., 644 F. 2d 1334 , 1340-1341 (CA9 1981); operation of a telephone system, Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v. FCC, 553 F. 2d 694, 700-701 (CA1 1977); leasing and sale of natural gas, Public Service Co. of N. C. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 716 , 721 (CA5), cert. denied sub nom. Louisiana v. FERC, 444 U. S. 879 (1979); operation of a mental health facility, Williams v. Eastside Mental *539 Health Center, Inc., 669 F. 2d 671, 680-681 (CA11), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 976 (1982); and provision of in-house domestic services for the aged and handicapped, Bonnette v. California Health and Welfare Agency, 704 F. 2d 1465 , 1472 (CA9 1983), are not entitled to immunity.  We find it difficult, if not impossible, to identify an organizing principle that places each of the cases in the first group on one side of a line and each of the cases in the second group on the other side.  The constitutional distinction between licensing drivers and regulating traffic, for example, or between operating a highway authority and operating a mental health facility, is elusive at best.  Thus far, this Court itself has made little headway in defining the scope of the governmental functions deemed protected under National League of Cities.  In that case the Court set forth examples of protected and unprotected functions, see <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 851, 854, n. 18</citedDecision> , but provided no explanation of how those examples were identified.  The only other case in which the Court has had occasion to address the problem is Long Island.  5 We there observed: “The determination of whether a federal law impairs a state’s authority with respect to ‘areas of traditional [state] functions’ may at times be a difficult one.” 455 U. S., at 684 , quoting National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 852</citedDecision> .  The accuracy of that statement is demonstrated by this Court’s own difficulties in Long Island in developing a workable standard for “traditional governmental functions.” We relied in large part there on “the historical reality that the operation of railroads is not among the functions traditionally performed by state and local governments,” but we *540 simultaneously disavowed “a static historical view of state functions generally immune from federal regulation.” 455 U. S., at 686 (first emphasis added; second emphasis in original).  We held that the inquiry into a particular function’s “traditional” nature was merely a means of determining whether the federal statute at issue unduly handicaps “basic state prerogatives,” id., at 686-687 , but we did not offer an explanation of what makes one state function a “basic prerogative” and another function not basic.  Finally, having disclaimed a rigid reliance on the historical pedigree of state involvement in a particular area, we nonetheless found it appropriate to emphasize the extended historical record of federal involvement in the field of rail transportation.  Id., at 687-689 .  Many constitutional standards involve “undoubte[d] .  .

 See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 248 (1983) (concurring opinion).  It is equally true, however, that the text of the Constitution provides the beginning rather than the final answer to every inquiry into questions of federalism, for “[bjehind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control.” Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 322 (1934).  National League of Cities reflected the general conviction that the Constitution precludes “the National Government [from] devouring] the essentials of state sovereignty.” Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 205 (dissenting opinion).  In order to be faithful to the underlying federal premises of the Constitution, courts must look for the “postulates which limit and control.” What has proved problematic is not the perception that the Constitution’s federal structure imposes limitations on the Commerce Clause, but rather the nature and content of those limitations.  One approach to defining the limits on Con *548 gress’ authority to regulate the States under the Commerce Clause is to identify certain underlying elements of political sovereignty that are deemed essential to the States’ “separate and independent existence.” Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869).  This approach obviously underlay the Court’s use of the “traditional governmental function” concept in National League of Cities.  It also has led to the separate requirement that the challenged federal statute “address matters that are indisputably ‘attribute^] of state sovereignty.’” Hodel, 452 U. S., at 288 , quoting National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845</citedDecision> .  In National League of Cities itself, for example, the Court concluded that decisions by a State concerning the wages and hours of its employees are an “undoubted attribute of state sovereignty.” <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845</citedDecision> .  The opinion did not explain what aspects of such decisions made them such an “undoubted attribute,” and the Court since then has remarked on the uncertain scope of the concept.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S., at 238, n. 11 .  The point of the inquiry, however, has remained to single out particular features of a State’s internal governance that are deemed to be intrinsic parts of state sovereignty.  We doubt that courts ultimately can identify principled constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress’ Commerce Clause powers over the States merely by relying on a priori definitions of state sovereignty.  In part, this is because of the elusiveness of objective criteria for “fundamental” elements of state sovereignty, a problem we have witnessed in the search for “traditional governmental functions.” There is, however, a more fundamental reason: the sovereignty of the States is limited by the Constitution itself.  A variety of sovereign powers, for example, are withdrawn from the States by Article I, § 10.

 But the principal and basic limit on the federal commerce power is that inherent in all congressional action — the built-in restraints that our system provides through state participation in federal governmental action.  The political process ensures that laws that unduly burden the States will not be promulgated.  In the factual setting of these cases the internal safeguards of the political process have performed as intended.  These cases do not require us to identify or define what affirmative limits the constitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce Clause.  See Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  We note and accept Justice Frankfurter’s observation in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 583 (1946): “The process of Constitutional adjudication does not thrive on conjuring up horrible possibilities that never happen in the real world and devising doctrines sufficiently comprehensive in detail to cover the remotest contingency.  Nor need we go beyond what is required for a reasoned disposition of the kind of controversy now before the Court.” Though the separate concurrence providing the fifth vote in National League of Cities was “not untroubled by certain possible implications” of the decision, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 856</citedDecision> , the Court in that case attempted to articulate affirmative limits on the Commerce Clause power in terms of core governmental functions and fundamental attributes of state sovereignty.  But the model of democratic decisionmaking the *557 Court there identified underestimated, in our view, the solicitude of the national political process for the continued vitality of the States.  Attempts by other courts since then to draw guidance from this model have proved it both impracticable and doctrinally barren.  In sum, in National League of Cities the Court tried to repair what did not need repair.  We do not lightly overrule recent precedent.  22 We have not hesitated, however, when it has become apparent that a prior decision has departed from a proper understanding of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.  See United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 116-117 (1941).  Due respect for the reach of congressional power within the federal system mandates that we do so now.  National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), is overruled.  The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and these cases are remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  See Dove v. Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority, 701 F. 2d 50 (CA6 1983), cert. pending sub nom. City of Macon v. Joiner, No. 82-1974; Alewine v. City Council of Augusta, Ga., 699 F. 2d 1060 (CA111983), cert. pending, No. 83-257; Kramer v. New Castle Area Transit Authority, 677 F. 2d 308 (CA3 1982), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 1146 (1983); Francis v. City of Tallahassee, 424 So. 2d 61 (Fla. App. 1982).  Urban Mass Transportation: Hearings on H. R. 6663 et al. before the Subcommittee on Housing of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 419 (1970) (statement of F. Norman Hill).  Neither SATS nor SAMTA appears to have attempted to avoid the FLSA’s minimum-wage provisions.  We are informed that basic wage levels in the mass-transit industry traditionally have been well in excess of the minimum wages prescribed by the FLSA.

 In Powers , the Court upheld the application of the federal income tax to the income of trustees of a state-operated commuter railroad; the Court reiterated that “the State cannot withdraw sources of revenue from the federal taxing power by engaging in businesses which constitute a departure from usual governmental functions and to which, by reason of their nature, the federal taxing power would normally extend,” regardless of the *542 fact that the proprietary enterprises “are undertaken for what the State conceives to be the public benefit.” 293 U. S., at 225 .  Accord, Allen v. Regents, 304 U. S. 439, 451-453 (1938).  That concern was especially weighty in South Carolina because liquor taxes, the object of the dispute in that case, then accounted for over one-fourth of the Federal Government’s revenues.  See New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 598, n. 4 (1946) (dissenting opinion).  Indeed, the “traditional” nature of a particular governmental function can be a matter of historical nearsightedness; today’s self-evidently “traditional” function is often yesterday’s suspect innovation.  Thus, National League of Cities offered the provision of public parks and recreation as an example of a traditional governmental function.  <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 851</citedDecision> .  A scant 80 years earlier, however, in Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282 (1893), the Court pointed out that city commons originally had been provided not for recreation but for grazing domestic animals “in common,” and that “[i]n the memory of men now living, a proposition to take private property [by eminent domain] for a public park .  .  .  would have been regarded as a novel exercise of legislative power.” Id,, at 297.  For much the same reasons, the existence vel non of a tradition of federal involvement in a particular area does not provide an adequate standard for state immunity.  Most of the Federal Government’s current regulatory activity originated less than 50 years ago with the New Deal, and a good portion of it has developed within the past two decades.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice Powell, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Rehnquist, and Justice O’Connor join, dissenting.  The Court today, in its 5-4 decision, overrules National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), a case in which we held that Congress lacked authority to impose the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act on state and local governments.  Because I believe this decision substantially alters the federal system embodied in the Constitution, I dissent.  I There are, of course, numerous examples over the history of this Court in which prior decisions have been reconsidered and overruled.  There have been few cases, however, in which the principle of stare decisis and the rationale of recent *558 decisions were ignored as abruptly as we now witness.  1 The reasoning of the Court in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , and the principle applied there, have been reiterated consistently over the past eight years.  Since its decision in 1976, <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> has been cited and quoted in opinions joined by every Member of the present Court. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 287-293 (1981); Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 684-686 (1982); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 764-767 (1982).  Less than three years ago, in Long Island R. Co., supra, a unanimous Court reaffirmed the principles of <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> but found them inapplicable to the regulation of a railroad heavily engaged in interstate commerce.  The Court stated: “The key prong of the <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> test applicable to this case is the third one [repeated and reformulated in Hodel], which examines whether ‘the States’ compliance with the federal law would directly impair their ability “to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.”’” 455 U. S., at 684 .  The Court in that case recognized that the test “may at times be a difficult one,” ibid., but it was considered in that unanimous decision as settled constitutional doctrine.  As recently as June 1, 1982, the five Justices who constitute the majority in these cases also were the majority in FERC v. Mississippi .  In that case, the Court said: “In <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Usery, supra,</citedDecision> for example, the Court made clear that the State’s regulation of its relationship with its employees is an ‘undoubted attribute of state sovereignty.’ <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845</citedDecision> .  Yet, *559 by holding ‘unimpaired’ California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), which upheld a federal labor regulation as applied to state railroad employees, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 854, n. 18</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> acknowledged that not all aspects of a State’s sovereign authority are immune from federal control.” 456 U. S., at 764, n. 28 .  The Court went on to say that ev-en~where the requirements of the <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> standard are met, “‘[t]here are situations in which the nature of the federal interest advanced may be such that it justifies state submission.’” Ibid., quoting Hodel, supra, at 288, n. 29 .  The joint federal/state system of regulation in FERC was such a “situation,” but there was no hint in the Court’s opinion that <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> — or its basic standard — was subject to the infirmities discovered today.  Although the doctrine is not rigidly applied to constitutional questions, “any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification.” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).  See also Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U. S. 667, 691-692, n. 34 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  In the present cases, the five Justices who compose the majority today participated in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and the cases reaffirming it.  2 The stability of judicial decision, and with it respect for the authority of this Court, are not served by the precipitate overruling of multiple precedents that we witness in these cases. 3 Whatever effect the Court’s decision may have in weakening the application of stare decisis, it is likely to be less *560 important than what the Court has done to the Constitution itself.  A unique feature of the United States is the federal system of government guaranteed by the Constitution and implicit in the very name of our country.  Despite some genuflecting in the Court’s opinion to the concept of federalism, today’s decision effectively reduces the Tenth Amendment to meaningless rhetoric when Congress acts pursuant to the Commerce Clause.  The Court hoids that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) “contravened no_affirmative limit on Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause” to determine the wage rates and hours of employment of all state and local employees.  Ante, at 556.  In rejecting the traditional view of our federal system, the Court states: “Apart from the limitation on federal authority inherent in the delegated nature of Congress’ Article I powers, the principal means chosen by the Framers to ensure the role of the States in the federal system lies in the structure of the Federal Government itself.” Ante, at 550 (emphasis added).  To leave no doubt about its intention, the Court renounces its decision in National League of Cities"because it “inevitably invites an unelected federal judiciary to make decisions about which state policies its favors and which ones it dislikes.” Ante, at 546.  In other words, the extent to which the States may exercise their authority, when Congress purports to act under the Commerce Clause, henceforth is to be determined from time to time by political decisions made by members of the Federal Government, decisions the Court says will not be subject to judicial review.  I note that it does not seem to have occurred to the Court that it — an unelected majority of five Justices — today rejects almost 200 years of the understanding of the constitutional status of federalism.  In doing so, there is only a single passing reference to the Tenth Amendment.  Nor is so much as a dictum of any court cited in support of the view that the role of the States in the federal system may depend upon *561 the grace of elected federal officials, rather than on the Constitution as interpreted by this Court. In my opinion that follows, Part II addresses the Court’s criticisms of <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  Part III reviews briefly the understanding of federalism that ensured the ratification of the Constitution and the extent to which this Court, until today, has recognized that the States retain a significant measure of sovereignty in our federal system.  Part IV considers the applicability of the FLSA to the indisputably local service provided by an urban transit system.  II The Court finds that the test of state immunity approved in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and its progeny is unworkable and unsound in principle.  In finding the test to be unworkable, the Court begins by mischaracterizing <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and subsequent cases. In concluding that efforts to define state immunity are unsound in principle, the Court radically departs from long-settled constitutional values and ignores the role of judicial review in our system of government.  A Much of the Court’s opinion is devoted to arguing that it is difficult to define a priori “traditional governmental functions.” <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> neither engaged in, nor required, such a task.  4 The Court discusses and condemns *562 as standards “traditional governmental functions,” “purely historical” functions, “‘uniquely’ governmental functions,” and “‘necessary’ governmental services.” Ante, at 539, 543, 545.  But nowhere does it mention that <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> adopted a familiar type of balancing test for determining whether Commerce Clause enactments transgress constitutional limitations imposed by the federal nature of our system of government.  This omission is noteworthy, since the author of today’s opinion joined <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and concurred separately to point out that the Court’s opinion in that case “adopt[s] a balancing approach [that] does not outlaw federal power in areas .  .  .  where the federal interest is demonstrably greater and where state .  .  .  compliance with imposed federal standards would be essential.” <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 856</citedDecision> (Blackmun, J., concurring).  In reading <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> to embrace a balancing approach, Justice Blackmun quite correctly cited the part of the opinion that reaffirmed Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975).  The Court’s analysis reaffirming Fry explicitly weighed the seriousness of the problem addressed by the federal legislation at issue in that case, against the effects of compliance on state sovereignty.  <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 852-853</citedDecision> .  Our subsequent decisions also adopted this approach of weighing the respective interests of the States and Federal *563 Government.  5 In EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983), for example, the Court stated that “[t]he principle of immunity articulated in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> is a functional doctrine .  .  .  whose ultimate purpose is not to create a sacred province of state autonomy, but to ensure that the unique benefits of a federal system .  .  .  not be lost through undue federal interference in certain core state functions.” Id., at 236.  See also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264 (1981).  In overruling <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , the Court incorrectly characterizes the mode of analysis established therein and developed in subsequent cases. 6 *564 Moreover, the statute at issue in this case, the FLSA, is the identical statute that was at issue in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  Although Justice Blackmun’s concurrence noted that he was “not untroubled by certain possible implications of the Court’s opinion” in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , it also stated that “the result with respect to the statute under challenge here [the FLSA] is necessarily correct.” <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 856</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  His opinion for the Court today does not discuss the statute, nor identify any changed circumstances that warrant the conclusion today that <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> is necessarily wrong.  B Today’s opinion does not explain how the States’jrole in the electoral process guarantees that particular exercises, of the Commerce Clause power will not infringe on residual state sovereignty.  7 Members of Congress are elected from the various States, but once in office they are Members of the *565 Federal Government.  8 Although the States participate in the Electoral College, this is hardly a reason to view the President as a representative of the States’ interest against federal encroachment.  We noted recently “[t]he hydraulic pressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to exceed the outer limits of its power.  .  ..” INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 951 (1983).

 .  .  .” The Federalist No. 46, p. 316 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Like Hamilton, Madison saw the States’ involvement in the everyday concerns of the people as the source of *572 their citizens’ loyalty.  Ibid. See also Nagel, Federalism as a Fundamental Value: National League of Cities in Perspective, 1981 S. Ct. Rev. 81.  Thus, the harm to the States that results from federal overreaching under the Commerce Clause is not simply a matter of dollars and cents.  National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 846-851</citedDecision> .  Nor is it a matter of the -wisdom or folly of certain policy choices.  Cf. ante, at 546.  Rather, by usurping functions traditionally performed by the States, federal overreaching under the Commerce Clause undermines the constitutionally mandated balance of power between the States and the Federal Government, a balance designed to protect our fundamental liberties.  C The emasculation of the powers of the States that can result from the Court’s decision is predicated on the Commerce Clause as a power “delegated to the United States” by the Constitution.  The relevant language states: “Congress shall have power... To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” Art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  Section 8 identifies a score of powers, listing the authority to lay taxes, borrow money on the credit of the United States, pay its debts, and provide for the common defense and the general welfare before its brief reference to “Commerce.” It is clear from the debates leading up to the adoption of the Constitution that the commerce to be regulated was that which the States themselves lacked the practical capability to regulate.  See, e. g., 1 M. Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (rev. ed. 1937); The Federalist Nos. 7, 11, 22, 42, 45.  See also EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 265 (1983) (Powell, J., dissenting).  Indeed, the language of the Clause itself focuses on activities that only a National Government could regulate: commerce with foreign nations and Indian tribes and “among” the several States.  *573 To be sure, this Court has construed the Commerce Clause to accommodate unanticipated changes over the past two centuries.  As these changes have occurred, the Court has had to decide whether the Federal Government has exceeded its authority by regulating activities beyond the capability of a single State to regulate or beyond legitimate federal interests that outweighed the authority and interests of the States.  In so doing, however, the Court properly has been mindful of the essential role of the States in our federal system.  The opinion for the Court in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> was faithful to history in its understanding of federalism.  The Court observed that “our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of States as States by means of the commerce power.” <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 842</citedDecision> .  The Tenth Amendment was invoked to prevent Congress from exercising its “‘power in a fashion that impairs the States’ integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.’” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 842-843 (quoting Fry v. United States, 421 U. S., at 547, n. 7 ).  This Court has recognized repeatedly that state sovereignty is a fundamental component of our system of government.  More than a century ago, in Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 (1869), the Court stated that the Constitution recognized “the necessary existence of the States, and, within their proper spheres, the independent authority of the States.” It concluded, as Madison did, that this authority extended to “nearly the whole charge of interior regulation .  .  .  ; to [the States] and to the people all powers not expressly delegated to the national government are reserved.” Id., at 76 .  Recently, in Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U. S. 40, 53 (1982), the Court recognized that the state action exemption from the antitrust laws was based on state sovereignty.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 16 That Amendment states explicitly that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States .  .  .  are reserved to the States.” The Court recasts this language to say that the States retain their sovereign powers “only to the extent that the Constitution has not divested them of their original powers and transferred those powers to the Federal *575 Government.” Ante, at 549.  This rephrasing is not a distinction without a difference; rather, it reflects the Court’s unprecedented view that Congress is free under the Commerce Clause to assume a State’s traditional sovereign power, and to do so without judicial review of its action.  Indeed, the Court’s view of federalism appears to relegate the States to precisely the trivial role that opponents of the Constitution feared they would occupy.  17 In <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , we spoke of fire prevention, police protection, sanitation, and public health as “typical of [the services] performed by state and local governments in discharging their dual functions of administering the public law and furnishing public services.” <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 851</citedDecision> .  Not only are these activities remote from any normal concept of interstate commerce, they are also activities that epitomize the concerns of local, democratic self-government.  See n. 5, supra. In emphasizing the need to protect traditional governmental functions, we identified the kinds of activities engaged in by state and local governments that affect the everyday lives of citizens.  These are services that people are in a position to understand and evaluate, and in a democracy, have the right to oversee.  18 We recognized that “it is *576 functions such as these which governments are created to provide ...” and that the States and local governments are better able than the National Government to perform them.  <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 851</citedDecision> .  The Court maintains that the standard approved in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> “disserves principles of democratic self-governance.” Ante, at 547.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court looks myopically only to persons elected to positions in the Federal Government.  It disregards entirely the far more effective role of democratic self-government at the state and local levels.  One must compare realistically the operation of the state and local governments with that of the Federal Government.  Federal legislation is drafted primarily by the staffs of the congressional committees.  In view of the hundreds of bills introduced at each session of Congress and the complexity of many of them, it is virtually impossible for even the most conscientious legislators to be truly familiar with many of the statutes enacted.  Federal departments and agencies customarily are authorized to write regulations.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 In drawing this contrast, I imply no criticism of these federal employees or the officials who are ultimately in charge.  The great majority are conscientious and faithful to their duties.  My point is simply that members of the immense federal bureaucracy are not elected, know less about the services traditionally rendered by States and localities, and are inevitably less responsive to recipients of such services, than are state legislatures, city councils, boards of supervisors, and state and local commissions, boards, and agencies.  It is at these state and local levels — not in Washington as the Court so mistakenly thinks — that “democratic self-government” is best exemplified.  IV The question presented in these cases is whether the extension of the FLSA to the wages and hours of employees of a city-owned transit system unconstitutionally impinges on fundamental state sovereignty.  The Court’s sweeping holding does far more than simply answer this question in the negative.  In overruling <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , today’s opinion apparently authorizes federal control, under the auspices of the Commerce Clause, over the terms and conditions of employment of all state and local employees.  Thus, for purposes of federal regulation, the Court rejects the distinction between public and private employers that had been drawn carefully in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  The Court’s action reflects a serious misunderstanding, if not an outright rejection, of the history of our country and the intention of the Framers of the Constitution.  19 *578 I return now to the balancing test approved in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and accepted in Hodel, Long Island R. Co., and FERC v. Mississippi .  See n. 5, supra. The Court does not find in these cases that the “federal interest is demonstrably greater.” <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 856</citedDecision> (Blackmun, J., concurring).  No such finding could have been made, for the state interest is compelling.  The financial impact on States and localities of displacing their control over wages, hours, overtime regulations, pensions, and labor relations -with their employees could have serious, as well as unanticipated, effects on state and local planning, budgeting, and the levying of taxes.  20 As we said in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , federal control of the terms and conditions of employment of state employees also inevitably “displaces state policies regarding the manner in which [States] will structure delivery of those governmental services that citizens require.” <citedDecision>Id., at 847</citedDecision> .  The Court emphasizes that municipal operation of an intra-city mass transit system is relatively new in the life of our country.  It nevertheless is a classic example of the type of service traditionally provided by local government.  It is local by definition.  It is indistinguishable in principle from the traditional services of providing and maintaining streets, public lighting, traffic control, water, and sewerage systems.  21 Services of this kind are precisely those with which citizens are more “familiarly and minutely conversant.” The Federalist No. 46, p. 316 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  State and local officials of course must be intimately familiar with these services and sensitive to their quality as well as cost.  Such *579 officials also know that their constituents and the press respond to the adequacy, fair distribution, and cost of these services.  It is this kind of state and local control and accountability that the Framers understood would insure the vitality and preservation of the federal system that the Constitution explicitly requires.  See National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 847-852</citedDecision> .  V Although the Court’s opinion purports to recognize that the States retain some sovereign power, it does not identify even a single aspect of state authority that would remain when the Commerce Clause is invoked to justify federal regulation.  In Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968), overruled by <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and today reaffirmed, the Court sustained an extension of the FLSA to certain hospitals, institutions, and schools.  Although the Court’s opinion in Wirtz was comparatively narrow, Justice Douglas, in dissent, wrote presciently that the Court’s reading of the Commerce Clause would enable “the National Government [to] devour the essentials of state sovereignty, though that sovereignty is attested by the Tenth Amendment.” 392 U. S., at 205 .  Today’s decision makes Justice Douglas’ fear once again a realistic one.  As I view the Court’s decision today as rejecting the basic precepts of our federal system and limiting the constitutional role of judicial review, I dissent.  <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , following some changes in the composition of the Court, had overruled Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968).  Unlike <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , the rationale of Wirtz had not been repeatedly accepted by our subsequent decisions.  Justice O’Connor, the only new Member of the Court since our decision in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , has joined the Court in reaffirming its principles.  See Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678 (1982), and FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775 (1982) (O’Connor, J., dissenting in part).  As one commentator noted, stare decisis represents “a natural evolution from the very nature of our institutions.” Lile, Some Views on the Rule of Stare Decisis, 4 Va. L. Rev. 95 , 97 (1916).  In <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , we referred to the sphere of state sovereignty as including “traditional governmental functions,” a realm which is, of course, difficult to define with precision.  But the luxury of precise definitions is one rarely enjoyed in interpreting and applying the general provisions of our Constitution.  Not surprisingly, therefore, the Court’s attempt to demonstrate the impossibility of definition is unhelpful.  A number of the cases it cites simply do not involve the problem of defining governmental functions.  E. g., Williams v. Eastside Mental Health Center, Inc., 669 F. 2d 671 (CA11), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 976 (1982); Friends of the Earth v. Carey, 552 F. 2d 25 (CA2), cert. denied, 434 U. S. 902 (1977).  A number of others are not properly analyzed under the principles *562 of <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , notwithstanding some of the language of the lower courts.  E. g., United States v. Best, 573 F. 2d 1095 (CA91978), and Hybud Equipment Corp. v. City of Akron, 654 F. 2d 1187 (CA6 1981).  Moreover, rather than carefully analyzing the case law, the Court simply lists various functions thought to be protected or unprotected by courts interpreting National League of Cities.  Ante, at 538-539.  In the cited cases, however, the courts considered the issue of state immunity on the specific facts at issue; they did not make blanket pronouncements that particular things inherently qualified as traditional governmental functions or did not.  Having thus considered the cases out of context, it was not difficult for the Court to conclude that there is no “organizing principle” among them.  See ante, at 539.

 ”).  Similarly, we have considered whether exempting States from federal regulation would undermine the goals of the federal program.  See Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975).  See also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 282 (1981) (national surface mining standards necessary to insure competition among States does not undermine States’ efforts to maintain adequate intrastate standards).  On the other hand, we have also assessed the injury done to the States if forced to comply with federal Commerce Clause enactments.  See National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 846-851</citedDecision> .  In addition, reliance on the Court’s difficulties in the tax immunity field is misplaced.  Although the Court has abandoned the “governmental/proprietary” distinction in this field, see New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), it has not taken the drastic approach of relying solely on the structure of the Federal Government to protect the States’ *564 immunity from taxation.  See Massachusetts v. United States, 485 U. S. 444 (1978).  Thus, faced with an equally difficult problem of defining constitutional boundaries of federal action directly affecting the States, we did not adopt the view many would think naive, that the Federal Government itself will protect whatever rights the States may have.  Late in its opinion, the Court suggests that after all there may be some “affirmative limits the constitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce Clause.” Ante, at 556.  The Court asserts that “[i]n the factual setting of these cases the internal safeguards of the political process have performed as intended.” Ibid. The Court does not explain the basis for this judgment.  Nor does it identify the circumstances in which the “political process” may fail and “affirmative limits” are to be imposed.  Presumably, such limits are to be determined by the Judicial Branch even though it is “unelected.” Today’s opinion, however, has rejected the balancing standard and suggests no other standard that would enable a court to determine when there has been a malfunction of the “political process.” The Court’s failure to specify the “affirmative limits” on federal power, or when and how these limits are to be determined, may well be'explained by the transparent fact that any such attempt would be subject to precisely the same objections on which it relies to overrule <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  One can hardly imagine this Court saying that because Congress is composed of individuals, individual rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights are amply protected by the political process.  Yet, the position adopted today is indistinguishable in principle.  The Tenth Amendment also is an essential part of the Bill of Rights.  See infra, at 568-570.  At one time in our history, the view that the structure of the Federal Government sufficed to protect the States might have had a somewhat more practical, although not a more logical, basis.  Professor Wechsler, whose seminal article in 1954 proposed the view adopted by the Court today, predicated his argument on assumptions that simply do not accord with current reality.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Regardless of the willingness of the Federal Government to provide federal aid, the constitutional question remains the same: whether the federal statute violates the sovereign powers reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment.  Apparently in an effort to reassure the States, the Court identifies several major statutes that thus far have not been made applicable to state governments: the Federal Power Act, 16 U. S. C. § 824 (f); the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. § 152 (2); the Labor-Management Re- ’ porting and Disclosure Act, 29 U. S. C. § 402 (e); the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U. S. C. § 652 (5); the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U. S. C. §§ 1002 (32), 1003(b)(1); and the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. § 1 et seq.; see Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943).  Ante, at 553.  The Court does not suggest that this restraint will continue after its decision here.  Indeed, it is unlikely that special interest groups will fail *567 to accept the Court’s open invitation to urge Congress to extend these and other statutes to apply to the States and their local subdivisions.  This Court has never before abdicated responsibility for assessing the constitutionality of challenged action on the ground that affected parties theoretically are able to look out for their own interests through the electoral process.  As the Court noted in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , a much stronger argument as to inherent structural protections could have been made in either Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976), or Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926), than can be made here.  In these cases, the President signed legislation that limited his authority with respect to certain appointments and thus arguably “it was ... no concern of this Court that the law violated the Constitution.” <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 841-842, n. 12</citedDecision> .  The Court nevertheless held the laws unconstitutional because they infringed on Presidential authority, the President’s consent notwithstanding.  The Court does not address this point; nor does it cite any authority for its contrary view.  The Court states that the decision in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> “invites an unelected federal judiciary to make decisions about which state *568 policies it favors and which ones its dislikes.” Curiously, the Court then suggests that under the application of the “traditional” governmental function analysis, “the States cannot serve as laboratories for social and economic experiment.” Ante, at 546, citing Justice Brandeis’ famous observation in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  Apparently the Court believes that when “an unelected federal judiciary” makes decisions as to whether a particular function is one for the Federal or State Governments, the States no longer may engage in “social and economic experiment.” Ante, at 546.  The Court does not explain how leaving the States virtually at the mercy of the Federal Government, without recourse to judicial review, will enhance their opportunities to experiment and serve as ‘laboratories.” Opponents of the Constitution were particularly dubious of the Federalists’ claim that the States retained powers not delegated to the United States in the absence of an express provision so providing.  For example, James Winthrop wrote that “[i]t is a mere fallacy.  .  .  that what rights are not given are reserved.” Letters of Agrippa, reprinted in 1B.

 This is as true today as it was when the Constitution was adopted.  “Participation is likely to be more frequent, and exercised at more different stages of a governmental activity at the local level, or in regional organizations, than at the state and federal levels.  [Additionally,] the proportion of people actually involved from the total population tends to be greater, the lower the level of govern *576 ment, and this, of course, better approximates the citizen participation ideal.” ACIR, Citizen Participation in the American Federal System 95 (1980).  Moreover, we have witnessed in recent years the rise of numerous special interest groups that engage in sophisticated lobbying, and make substantial campaign contributions to some Members of Congress.  These groups are thought to have significant influence in the shaping and enactment of certain types of legislation.  Contrary to the Court’s view, a “political process” that functions in this way is' unlikely to safeguard the sovereign rights of States and localities.  See n. 9, supra. The opinion of the Court in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> makes clear that the very essence of a federal system of government is to impose “definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.” <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 842</citedDecision> .  See also the Court’s opinion in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 547, n. 7 (1975).  As Justice Douglas observed in his dissent in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 203 , extension of the FLSA to the States could “disrupt the fiscal policy of the States and threaten their autonomy in the regulation of health and education.” In Long Island R. Co. the unanimous Court recognized that “[t]his Court’s emphasis on traditional governmental functions and traditional aspects of state sovereignty was not meant to impose a static historical view of state functions generally immune from federal regulation.” 455 U. S.. at 686.

 With him on the briefs on the original argument were Mr. Lee, Assistant Attorney General McGrath, Deputy Solicitor General Geller, Joshua I.  Schwartz, Michael F. Hertz, and Douglas Letter.

Coleman, Jr., reargued the cause for appellees in both cases. With him on the briefs for appellee American Public Transit Association were Donald T. Bliss and Zoe E. Baird.  George P. Parker, Jr., filed briefs for appellee San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority.  [] *530 JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court. We revisit in these cases an issue raised in National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976).  In that litigation, this Court, by a sharply divided vote, ruled that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to enforce the minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) against the States "in areas of traditional governmental functions." <citedDecision>Id., at 852</citedDecision> .  Although <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> supplied some examples of "traditional governmental functions," it did not offer a general explanation of how a "traditional" function is to be distinguished from a "nontraditional" one.  Since then, federal and state courts have struggled with the task, thus imposed, of identifying a traditional function for purposes of state immunity under the Commerce Clause.  In the present cases, a Federal District Court concluded that municipal ownership and operation of a mass-transit system is a traditional governmental function and thus, under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , is exempt from the obligations imposed by the FLSA.  Faced with the identical question, three Federal Courts of Appeals and one state appellate court have reached the opposite conclusion.  [1] *531 Our examination of this "function" standard applied in these and other cases over the last eight years now persuades us that the attempt to draw the boundaries of state regulatory immunity in terms of "traditional governmental function" is not only unworkable but is also inconsistent with established principles of federalism and, indeed, with those very federalism principles on which <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> purported to rest. That case, accordingly, is overruled.  I The history of public transportation in San Antonio, Tex., is characteristic of the history of local mass transit in the United States generally.  Passenger transportation for hire within San Antonio originally was provided on a private basis by a local transportation company.  In 1913, the Texas Legislature authorized the State's municipalities to regulate vehicles providing carriage for hire.  1913 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 147, § 4, ¶ 12, now codified, as amended, as Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann., Art. 1175, §§ 20 and 21 (Vernon 1963).  Two years later, San Antonio enacted an ordinance setting forth franchising, insurance, and safety requirements for passenger vehicles operated for hire.  The city continued to rely on such publicly regulated private mass transit until 1959, when it purchased the privately owned San Antonio Transit Company and replaced it with a public authority known as the San Antonio Transit System (SATS).
**Combined Opinion**
 The application of the FLSA to public schools and hospitals was ruled to be within Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968).  The FLSA obligations of public mass-transit systems like SATS were expanded in 1974 when Congress provided for the progressive repeal of the surviving overtime exemption for mass-transit employees.  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, § 21(b), 88 Stat. 68 .  Congress simultaneously brought the States and their subdivisions further within the ambit of the FLSA by extending FLSA coverage to virtually all state and local-government employees.  §§ 6(a)(1) and (6), 88 Stat. 58 , 60, 29 U. S. C. §§ 203 (d) and (x).  SATS complied with the FLSA's overtime requirements until 1976, when this Court, in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , overruled Maryland v. Wirtz , and held that the FLSA could not be *534 applied constitutionally to the "traditional governmental functions" of state and local governments.  Four months after <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> was handed down, SATS informed its employees that the decision relieved SATS of its overtime obligations under the FLSA.  [3] Matters rested there until September 17, 1979, when the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor issued an opinion that SAMTA's operations "are not constitutionally immune from the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act" under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  Opinion WH-499, 6 LRR 91:1138.  On November 21 of that year, SAMTA filed this action against the Secretary of Labor in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.  It sought a declaratory judgment that, contrary to the Wage and Hour Administration's determination, <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> precluded the application of the FLSA's overtime requirements to SAMTA's operations.  The Secretary counterclaimed under 29 U. S. C. § 217 for enforcement of the overtime and recordkeeping requirements of the FLSA.  On the same day that SAMTA filed its action, appellant Garcia and several other SAMTA employees brought suit against SAMTA in the same District Court for overtime pay under the FLSA.  Garcia v. SAMTA, Civil Action No. SA 79 CA 458.  The District Court has stayed that action pending the outcome of these cases, but it allowed Garcia to intervene in the present litigation as a defendant in support of the Secretary.  One month after SAMTA brought suit, the Department of Labor formally amended its FLSA interpretive regulations to provide that publicly owned local mass-transit systems are not entitled to immunity under *535 <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  44 Fed. Reg. 75630 (1979), codified as 29 CFR § 775.3 (b)(3) (1984).  On November 17, 1981, the District Court granted SAMTA's motion for summary judgment and denied the Secretary's and Garcia's cross-motion for partial summary judgment.  Without further explanation, the District Court ruled that "local public mass transit systems (including [SAMTA]) constitute integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions" under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  App. D to Juris. Statement in No. 82-1913, p. 24a.  The Secretary and Garcia both appealed directly to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1252 .  During the pendency of those appeals, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678 (1982), was decided.  In that case, the Court ruled that commuter rail service provided by the state-owned Long Island Rail Road did not constitute a "traditional governmental function" and hence did not enjoy constitutional immunity, under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , from the requirements of the Railway Labor Act.  Thereafter, it vacated the District Court's judgment in the present cases and remanded them for further consideration in the light of Long Island.  457 U. S. 1102 (1982).  On remand, the District Court adhered to its original view and again entered judgment for SAMTA.  557 F. Supp. 445 (1983).  The court looked first to what it regarded as the "historical reality" of state involvement in mass transit.  It recognized that States not always had owned and operated mass-transit systems, but concluded that they had engaged in a longstanding pattern of public regulation, and that this regulatory tradition gave rise to an "inference of sovereignty." Id., at 447-448 .  The court next looked to the record of federal involvement in the field and concluded that constitutional immunity would not result in an erosion of federal authority with respect to state-owned mass-transit systems, because many federal statutes themselves contain exemptions for States and thus make the withdrawal of federal *536 regulatory power over public mass-transit systems a supervening federal policy.  Id., at 448-450 .  Although the Federal Government's authority over employee wages under the FLSA obviously would be eroded, Congress had not asserted any interest in the wages of public mass-transit employees until 1966 and hence had not established a longstanding federal interest in the field, in contrast to the century-old federal regulatory presence in the railroad industry found significant for the decision in Long Island.  Finally, the court compared mass transit to the list of functions identified as constitutionally immune in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and concluded that it did not differ from those functions in any material respect.  The court stated: "If transit is to be distinguished from the exempt [National League of Cities] functions it will have to be by identifying a traditional state function in the same way pornography is sometimes identified: someone knows it when they see it, but they can't describe it." 557 F. Supp., at 453 .  [4] The Secretary and Garcia again took direct appeals from the District Court's judgment.  We noted probable jurisdiction.  464 U. S. 812 (1983).  After initial argument, the cases were restored to our calendar for reargument, and the parties were requested to brief and argue the following additional question: "Whether or not the principles of the Tenth Amendment as set forth in National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), should be reconsidered?" 468 U. S. 1213 (1984).  Reargument followed in due course.  *537 II Appellees have not argued that SAMTA is immune from regulation under the FLSA on the ground that it is a local transit system engaged in intrastate commercial activity.  In a practical sense, SAMTA's operations might well be characterized as "local." Nonetheless, it long has been settled that Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause extends to intrastate economic activities that affect interstate commerce.  See, e. g., Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.

" Second, the statute must "address matters that are indisputably `attribute[s] of state sovereignty.' " Third, state compliance with the federal obligation must "directly impair [the States'] ability `to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.' " Finally, the relation of state and federal interests must not be such that "the nature of the federal interest .  .  .  justifies state submission." 452 U. S., at 287-288 , and n. 29, quoting National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845, 852, 854</citedDecision> .  *538 The controversy in the present cases has focused on the third Hotel requirement  that the challenged federal statute trench on "traditional governmental functions." The District Court voiced a common concern: "Despite the abundance of adjectives, identifying which particular state functions are immune remains difficult." 557 F. Supp., at 447 .  Just how troublesome the task has been is revealed by the results reached in other federal cases. Thus, courts have held that regulating ambulance services, Gold Cross Ambulance v. City of Kansas City, 538 F. Supp. 956, 967-969 (WD Mo. 1982), aff'd on other grounds, 705 F. 2d 1005 (CA8 1983), cert. pending, No. 83-138; licensing automobile drivers, United States v. Best, 573 F. 2d 1095, 1102-1103 (CA9 1978); operating a municipal airport, Amersbach v. City of Cleveland, 598 F. 2d 1033, 1037-1038 (CA6 1979); performing solid waste disposal, Hybud Equipment Corp. v. City of Akron, 654 F. 2d 1187, 1196 (CA6 1981); and operating a highway authority, Molina-Estrada v. Puerto Rico Highway Authority, 680 F. 2d 841, 845-846 (CA1 1982), are functions protected under National League of Cities.  At the same time, courts have held that issuance of industrial development bonds, Woods v. Homes and Structures of Pittsburg, Kansas, Inc., 489 F. Supp. 1270, 1296-1297 (Kan. 1980); regulation of intrastate natural gas sales, Oklahoma ex rel. Derryberry v. FERC, 494 F. Supp. 636, 657 (WD Okla. 1980), aff'd, 661 F. 2d 832 (CA10 1981), cert. denied sub nom. Texas v. FERC, 457 U. S. 1105 (1982); regulation of traffic on public roads, Friends of the Earth v. Carey, 552 F. 2d 25, 38 (CA2), cert. denied, 434 U. S. 902 (1977); regulation of air transportation, Hughes Air Corp. v. Public Utilities Comm'n of Cal., 644 F. 2d 1334 , 1340-1341 (CA9 1981); operation of a telephone system, Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v. FCC, 553 F. 2d 694, 700-701 (CA1 1977); leasing and sale of natural gas, Public Service Co. of N. C. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 716 , 721 (CA5), cert. denied sub nom. Louisiana v. FERC, 444 U. S. 879 (1979); operation of a mental health facility, Williams v. Eastside Mental *539 Health Center, Inc., 669 F. 2d 671, 680-681 (CA11), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 976 (1982); and provision of in-house domestic services for the aged and handicapped, Bonnette v. California Health and Welfare Agency, 704 F. 2d 1465 , 1472 (CA9 1983), are not entitled to immunity.  We find it difficult, if not impossible, to identify an organizing principle that places each of the cases in the first group on one side of a line and each of the cases in the second group on the other side.  The constitutional distinction between licensing drivers and regulating traffic, for example, or between operating a highway authority and operating a mental health facility, is elusive at best.  Thus far, this Court itself has made little headway in defining the scope of the governmental functions deemed protected under National League of Cities.  In that case the Court set forth examples of protected and unprotected functions, see <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 851, 854, n. 18</citedDecision> , but provided no explanation of how those examples were identified.  The only other case in which the Court has had occasion to address the problem is Long Island.  [5] We there observed: "The determination of whether a federal law impairs a state's authority with respect to `areas of traditional [state] functions' may at times be a difficult one." 455 U. S., at 684 , quoting National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 852</citedDecision> .  The accuracy of that statement is demonstrated by this Court's own difficulties in Long Island is developing a workable standard for "traditional governmental functions." We relied in large part there on "the historical reality that the operation of railroads is not among the functions traditionally performed by state and local governments," but we *540 simultaneously disavowed "a static historical view of state functions generally immune from federal regulation." 455 U. S., at 686 (first emphasis added; second emphasis in original).  We held that the inquiry into a particular function's "traditional" nature was merely a means of determining whether the federal statute at issue unduly handicaps "basic state prerogatives," id., at 686-687 , but we did not offer an explanation of what makes one state function a "basic prerogative" and another function not basic.  Finally, having disclaimed a rigid reliance on the historical pedigree of state involvement in a particular area, we nonetheless found it appropriate to emphasize the extended historical record of federal involvement in the field of rail transportation.  Id., at 687-689 .
**Combined Opinion**
 In order to be faithful to the underlying federal premises of the Constitution, courts must look for the "postulates which limit and control." What has proved problematic is not the perception that the Constitution's federal structure imposes limitations on the Commerce Clause, but rather the nature and content of those limitations.  One approach to defining the limits on Congress' *548 authority to regulate the States under the Commerce Clause is to identify certain underlying elements of political sovereignty that are deemed essential to the States' "separate and independent existence." Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869).  This approach obviously underlay the Court's use of the "traditional governmental function" concept in National League of Cities.  It also has led to the separate requirement that the challenged federal statute "address matters that are indisputably `attribute[s] of state sovereignty.' " Hodel, 452 U. S., at 288 , quoting National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845</citedDecision> .  In National League of Cities itself, for example, the Court concluded that decisions by a State concerning the wages and hours of its employees are an "undoubted attribute of state sovereignty." <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845</citedDecision> .  The opinion did not explain what aspects of such decisions made them such an "undoubted attribute," and the Court since then has remarked on the uncertain scope of the concept.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S., at 238, n. 11 .  The point of the inquiry, however, has remained to single out particular features of a State's internal governance that are deemed to be intrinsic parts of state sovereignty.  We doubt that courts ultimately can identify principled constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress' Commerce Clause powers over the States merely by relying on a priori definitions of state sovereignty.  In part, this is because of the elusiveness of objective criteria for "fundamental" elements of state sovereignty, a problem we have witnessed in the search for "traditional governmental functions." There is, however, a more fundamental reason: the sovereignty of the States is limited by the Constitution itself.
**Combined Opinion**
 But the principal and basic limit on the federal commerce power is that inherent in all congressional action  the built-in restraints that our system provides through state participation in federal governmental action.  The political process ensures that laws that unduly burden the States will not be promulgated.  In the factual setting of these cases the internal safeguards of the political process have performed as intended.  These cases do not require us to identify or define what affirmative limits the constitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce Clause.  See Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  We note and accept Justice Frankfurter's observation in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 583 (1946): "The process of Constitutional adjudication does not thrive on conjuring up horrible possibilities that never happen in the real world and devising doctrines sufficiently comprehensive in detail to cover the remotest contingency.  Nor need we go beyond what is required for a reasoned disposition of the kind of controversy now before the Court." Though the separate concurrence providing the fifth vote in National League of Cities was "not untroubled by certain possible implications" of the decision, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 856</citedDecision> , the Court in that case attempted to articulate affirmative limits on the Commerce Clause power in terms of core governmental functions and fundamental attributes of state sovereignty.  But the model of democratic decisionmaking the *557A Court there identified underestimated, in our view, the solicitude of the national political process for the continued vitality of the States.  Attempts by other courts since then to draw guidance from this model have proved it both impracticable and doctrinally barren.  In sum, in National League of Cities the Court tried to repair what did not need repair.  We do not lightly overrule recent precedent.  [22] We have not hesitated, however, when it has become apparent that a prior decision has departed from a proper understanding of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.  See United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 116-117 (1941).  Due respect for the reach of congressional power within the federal system mandates that we do so now.  National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), is overruled.  The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and these cases are remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  *557B JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, dissenting.  The Court today, in its 5-4 decision, overrules National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), a case in which we held that Congress lacked authority to impose the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act on state and local governments.  Because I believe this decision substantially alters the federal system embodied in the Constitution, I dissent.  I There are, of course, numerous examples over the history of this Court in which prior decisions have been reconsidered and overruled.  There have been few cases, however, in which the principle of stare decisis and the rationale of recent *558 decisions were ignored as abruptly as we now witness.  [1] The reasoning of the Court in National League of Cities, and the principle applied there, have been reiterated consistently over the past eight years.  Since its decision in 1976, National League of Cities has been cited and quoted in opinions joined by every Member of the present Court. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 287-293 (1981); Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 684-686 (1982); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 764-767 (1982).  Less than three years ago, in Long Island R. Co., supra, a unanimous Court reaffirmed the principles of National League of Cities but found them inapplicable to the regulation of a railroad heavily engaged in interstate commerce.  The Court stated: "The key prong of the National League of Cities test applicable to this case is the third one [repeated and reformulated in Hodel ], which examines whether `the States' compliance with the federal law would directly impair their ability "to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions." ' " 455 U. S., at 684 .  The Court in that case recognized that the test "may at times be a difficult one," ibid., but it was considered in that unanimous decision as settled constitutional doctrine.  As recently as June 1, 1982, the five Justices who constitute the majority in these cases also were the majority in FERC v. Mississippi .  In that case, the Court said: "In National League of Cities v. <citedDecision>Usery, supra</citedDecision> , for example, the Court made clear that the State's regulation of its relationship with its employees is an `undoubted attribute of state sovereignty.' <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845</citedDecision> .  Yet, *559 by holding `unimpaired' California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), which upheld a federal labor regulation as applied to state railroad employees, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 854, n. 18</citedDecision> , National League of Cities acknowledged that not all aspects of a State's sovereign authority are immune from federal control." 456 U. S., at 764, n. 28 .  The Court went on to say that even where the requirements of the National League of Cities standard are met, " `[t]here are situations in which the nature of the federal interest advanced may be such that it justifies state submission.' " Ibid., quoting Hodel, supra, at 288, n. 29 .  The joint federal/state system of regulation in FERC was such a "situation," but there was no hint in the Court's opinion that National League of Cities  or its basic standard  was subject to the infirmities discovered today.  Although the doctrine is not rigidly applied to constitutional questions, "any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification." Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).

 .  .  where the federal interest is demonstrably greater and where state .  .  .  compliance with imposed federal standards would be essential." <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 856</citedDecision> (BLACKMUN, J., concurring).  In reading National League of Cities to embrace a balancing approach, JUSTICE BLACKMUN quite correctly cited the part of the opinion that reaffirmed Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975).  The Court's analysis reaffirming Fry explicitly weighed the seriousness of the problem addressed by the federal legislation at issue in that case, against the effects of compliance on state sovereignty.  <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 852-853</citedDecision> .  Our subsequent decisions also adopted this approach of weighing the respective interests of the States and Federal *563 Government.  [5] In EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983), for example, the Court stated that "[t]he principle of immunity articulated in National League of Cities is a functional doctrine .  .  .  whose ultimate purpose is not to create a sacred province of state autonomy, but to ensure that the unique benefits of a federal system .  .

 not be lost through undue federal interference in certain core state functions." Id., at 236.  See also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264 (1981).  In overruling National League of Cities, the Court incorrectly characterizes the mode of analysis established therein and developed in subsequent cases. [6] *564 Moreover, the statute at issue in this case, the FLSA, is the identical statute that was at issue in National League of Cities.  Although JUSTICE BLACKMUN's concurrence noted that he was "not untroubled by certain possible implications of the Court's opinion" in National League of Cities, it also stated that "the result with respect to the statute under challenge here [the FLSA] is necessarily correct.  " <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 856</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  His opinion for the Court today does not discuss the statute, nor identify any changed circumstances that warrant the conclusion today that National League of Cities is necessarily wrong.  B Today's opinion does not explain how the States' role in the electoral process guarantees that particular exercises of the Commerce Clause power will not infringe on residual state sovereignty.  [7] Members of Congress are elected from the various States, but once in office they are Members of the *565 Federal Government.  [8] Although the States participate in the Electoral College, this is hardly a reason to view the President as a representative of the States' interest against federal encroachment.  We noted recently "[t]he hydraulic pressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to exceed the outer limits of its power .  .

 .  ." The Federalist No. 46, p. 316 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Like Hamilton, Madison saw the States' involvement in the everyday concerns of the people as the source of *572 their citizens' loyalty.  Ibid. See also Nagel, Federalism as a Fundamental Value: National League of Cities in Perspective, 1981 S. Ct. Rev. 81.  Thus, the harm to the States that results from federal overreaching under the Commerce Clause is not simply a matter of dollars and cents.  National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 846-851</citedDecision> .  Nor is it a matter of the wisdom or folly of certain policy choices.  Cf. ante, at 546.  Rather, by usurping functions traditionally performed by the States, federal overreaching under the Commerce Clause undermines the constitutionally mandated balance of power between the States and the Federal Government, a balance designed to protect our fundamental liberties.  C The emasculation of the powers of the States that can result from the Court's decision is predicated on the Commerce Clause as a power "delegated to the United States" by the Constitution.  The relevant language states: "Congress shall have power .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 Indeed, the language of the Clause itself focuses on activities that only a National Government could regulate: commerce with foreign nations and Indian tribes and "among" the several States.  *573 To be sure, this Court has construed the Commerce Clause to accommodate unanticipated changes over the past two centuries.  As these changes have occurred, the Court has had to decide whether the Federal Government has exceeded its authority by regulating activities beyond the capability of a single State to regulate or beyond legitimate federal interests that outweighed the authority and interests of the States.  In so doing, however, the Court properly has been mindful of the essential role of the States in our federal system.  The opinion for the Court in National League of Cities was faithful to history in its understanding of federalism.  The Court observed that "our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of States as States by means of the commerce power." <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 842</citedDecision> .  The Tenth Amendment was invoked to prevent Congress from exercising its " `power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.' " <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 842-843 (quoting Fry v. United States, 421 U. S., at 547, n. 7 ).  This Court has recognized repeatedly that state sovereignty is a fundamental component of our system of government.  More than a century ago, in Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 (1869), the Court stated that the Constitution recognized "the necessary existence of the States, and, within their proper spheres, the independent authority of the States." It concluded, as Madison did, that this authority extended to "nearly the whole charge of interior regulation.  .  .  ; to [the States] and to the people all powers not expressly delegated to the national government are reserved."
**Combined Opinion**
 are reserved to the States." The Court recasts this language to say that the States retain their sovereign powers "only to the extent that the Constitution has not divested them of their original powers and transferred those powers to the Federal *575 Government." Ante, at 549.  This rephrasing is not a distinction without a difference; rather, it reflects the Court's unprecedented view that Congress is free under the Commerce Clause to assume a State's traditional sovereign power, and to do so without judicial review of its action.  Indeed, the Court's view of federalism appears to relegate the States to precisely the trivial role that opponents of the Constitution feared they would occupy.  [17] In National League of Cities, we spoke of fire prevention, police protection, sanitation, and public health as "typical of [the services] performed by state and local governments in discharging their dual functions of administering the public law and furnishing public services." <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 851</citedDecision> .  Not only are these activities remote from any normal concept of interstate commerce, they are also activities that epitomize the concerns of local, democratic self-government.  See n. 5, supra. In emphasizing the need to protect traditional governmental functions, we identified the kinds of activities engaged in by state and local governments that affect the everyday lives of citizens.  These are services that people are in a position to understand and evaluate, and in a democracy, have the right to oversee.  [18] We recognized that "it is *576 functions such as these which governments are created to provide .  .  ." and that the States and local governments are better able than the National Government to perform them.  <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 851</citedDecision> .  The Court maintains that the standard approved in National League of Cities "disserves principles of democratic self-governance." Ante, at 547.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court looks myopically only to persons elected to positions in the Federal Government.  It disregards entirely the far more effective role of democratic self-government at the state and local levels.  One must compare realistically the operation of the state and local governments with that of the Federal Government.  Federal legislation is drafted primarily by the staffs of the congressional committees.
**Combined Opinion**
 The Court's sweeping holding does far more than simply answer this question in the negative.  In overruling National League of Cities, today's opinion apparently authorizes federal control, under the auspices of the Commerce Clause, over the terms and conditions of employment of all state and local employees.  Thus, for purposes of federal regulation, the Court rejects the distinction between public and private employers that had been drawn carefully in National League of Cities.  The Court's action reflects a serious misunderstanding, if not an outright rejection, of the history of our country and the intention of the Framers of the Constitution.  [19] *578 I return now to the balancing test approved in National League of Cities and accepted in Hodel, Long Island R. Co., and FERC v. Mississippi .  See n. 5, supra. The Court does not find in these cases that the "federal interest is demonstrably greater." <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 856</citedDecision> (BLACKMUN, J., concurring).  No such finding could have been made, for the state interest is compelling.  The financial impact on States and localities of displacing their control over wages, hours, overtime regulations, pensions, and labor relations with their employees could have serious, as well as unanticipated, effects on state and local planning, budgeting, and the levying of taxes.  [20] As we said in National League of Cities, federal control of the terms and conditions of employment of state employees also inevitably "displaces state policies regarding the manner in which [States] will structure delivery of those governmental services that citizens require." Id., at 847.  The Court emphasizes that municipal operation of an intracity mass transit system is relatively new in the life of our country.  It nevertheless is a classic example of the type of service traditionally provided by local government.
**Combined Opinion**
 It is indistinguishable in principle from the traditional services of providing and maintaining streets, public lighting, traffic control, water, and sewerage systems.  [21] Services of this kind are precisely those with which citizens are more "familiarly and minutely conversant." The Federalist No. 46, p. 316 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  State and local officials of course must be intimately familiar with these services and sensitive to their quality as well as cost.  Such *579 officials also know that their constituents and the press respond to the adequacy, fair distribution, and cost of these services.  It is this kind of state and local control and accountability that the Framers understood would insure the vitality and preservation of the federal system that the Constitution explicitly requires.  See National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 847-852</citedDecision> .  V Although the Court's opinion purports to recognize that the States retain some sovereign power, it does not identify even a single aspect of state authority that would remain when the Commerce Clause is invoked to justify federal regulation.  In Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968), overruled by National League of Cities and today reaffirmed, the Court sustained an extension of the FLSA to certain hospitals, institutions, and schools.  Although the Court's opinion in Wirtz was comparatively narrow, Justice Douglas, in dissent, wrote presciently that the Court's reading of the Commerce Clause would enable "the National Government [to] devour the essentials of state sovereignty, though that sovereignty is attested by the Tenth Amendment." 392 U. S., at 205 .  Today's decision makes Justice Douglas' fear once again a realistic one.  As I view the Court's decision today as rejecting the basic precepts of our federal system and limiting the constitutional role of judicial review, I dissent.
**Combined Opinion**
 JUSTICE POWELL'S reference to the "balancing test" approved in National League of Cities is not identical with the language in that case, which recognized that Congress could not act under its commerce power to infringe on certain fundamental aspects of state sovereignty that are essential to "the States' separate and independent existence." Nor is either test, or JUSTICE *580 O'CONNOR'S suggested approach, precisely congruent with JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S views in 1976, when he spoke of a balancing approach which did not outlaw federal power in areas "where the federal interest is demonstrably greater." But under any one of these approaches the judgment in these cases should be affirmed, and I do not think it incumbent on those of us in dissent to spell out further the fine points of a principle that will, I am confident, in time again command the support of a majority of this Court. JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE POWELL and JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, dissenting.  The Court today surveys the battle scene of federalism and sounds a retreat.  Like JUSTICE POWELL, I would prefer to hold the field and, at the very least, render a little aid to the wounded.  I join JUSTICE POWELL'S opinion.  I also write separately to note my fundamental disagreement with the majority's views of federalism and the duty of this Court. The Court overrules National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), on the grounds that it is not "faithful to the role of federalism in a democratic society." Ante, at 546.  "The essence of our federal system," the Court concludes, "is that within the realm of authority left open to them under the Constitution, the States must be equally free to engage in any activity that their citizens choose for the common weal.  .  .  ." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> National League of Cities is held to be inconsistent with this narrow view of federalism because it attempts to protect only those fundamental aspects of state sovereignty that are essential to the States' separate and independent existence, rather than protecting all state activities "equally." In my view, federalism cannot be reduced to the weak "essence" distilled by the majority today.  There is more to federalism than the nature of the constraints that can be imposed on the States in "the realm of authority left open to them by the Constitution." The central issue of federalism, *581 of course, is whether any realm is left open to the States by the Constitution  whether any area remains in which a State may act free of federal interference.  "The issue .  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 The problems of federalism in an integrated national economy are capable of more responsible resolution than holding that the States as States retain no status apart from that which Congress chooses to let them retain.  The proper resolution, I suggest, lies in weighing state autonomy as a factor in the balance when interpreting the means by which Congress can exercise its authority on the States as States.  It is insufficient, in assessing the validity of congressional regulation of a State pursuant to the commerce power, to ask only whether the same regulation would be valid if enforced against a private party.  That reasoning, embodied in the majority opinion, is inconsistent with the spirit of our Constitution.  It remains relevant that a State is being regulated, as National League of Cities and every recent case have recognized.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, supra ; Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 684 (1982); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 287-288 (1981); National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 841-846</citedDecision> .  As far as the Constitution is concerned, a State should not be equated with any private litigant.  Cf. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 428 (1979) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting) (criticizing the ability of a state court to treat a sister State no differently than a private litigant).  Instead, the autonomy of a State is an essential component of federalism.  If state autonomy is ignored in assessing the means by which Congress regulates matters affecting commerce, then federalism becomes irrelevant simply because the set of activities remaining beyond the reach of such a commerce power "may well be negligible." Ante, at 545.  It has been difficult for this Court to craft bright lines defining the scope of the state autonomy protected by National *589 League of Cities.

293 U. S., at 225 .  Accord, Allen v. Regents, 304 U. S. 439, 451-453 (1938).  [8]  That concern was especially weighty in South Carolina because liquor taxes, the object of the dispute in that case, then accounted for over one-fourth of the Federal Government's revenues.  See New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 598, n. 4 (1946) (dissenting opinion).  [9]  Indeed, the "traditional" nature of a particular governmental function can be a matter of historical nearsightedness; today's self-evidently "traditional" function is often yesterday's suspect innovation.  Thus, National League of Cities offered the provision of public parks and recreation as an example of a traditional governmental function.  <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 851</citedDecision> .  A scant 80 years earlier, however, in Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282 (1893), the Court pointed out that city commons originally had been provided not for recreation but for grazing domestic animals "in common," and that "[i]n the memory of men now living, a proposition to take private property [by eminent domain] for a public park .  .  .  would have been regarded as a novel exercise of legislative power." Id., at 297 .  [10]  For much the same reasons, the existence vel non of a tradition of federal involvement in a particular area does not provide an adequate standard for state immunity.

 ").  Similarly, we have considered whether exempting States from federal regulation would undermine the goals of the federal program.  See Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975).  See also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 282 (1981) (national surface mining standards necessary to insure competition among States does not undermine States' efforts to maintain adequate intrastate standards).  On the other hand, we have also assessed the injury done to the States if forced to comply with federal Commerce Clause enactments.  See National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 846-851</citedDecision> .  [6]  In addition, reliance on the Court's difficulties in the tax immunity field is misplaced.  Although the Court has abandoned the "governmental/proprietary" distinction in this field, see New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), it has not taken the drastic approach of relying solely on the structure of the Federal Government to protect the States' immunity from taxation.  See Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444 (1978).  Thus, faced with an equally difficult problem of defining constitutional boundaries of federal action directly affecting the States, we did not adopt the view many would think naive, that the Federal Government itself will protect whatever rights the States may have.  [7]  Late in its opinion, the Court suggests that after all there may be some "affirmative limits the constitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce Clause." Ante, at 556.

 [12]  This Court has never before abdicated responsibility for assessing the constitutionality of challenged action on the ground that affected parties theoretically are able to look out for their own interests through the electoral process.  As the Court noted in National League of Cities, a much stronger argument as to inherent structural protections could have been made in either Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976), or Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926), than can be made here.  In these cases, the President signed legislation that limited his authority with respect to certain appointments and thus arguably "it was .  .  .  no concern of this Court that the law violated the Constitution." <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 841-842, n. 12</citedDecision> .  The Court nevertheless held the laws unconstitutional because they infringed on Presidential authority, the President's consent notwithstanding.  The Court does not address this point; nor does it cite any authority for its contrary view.  [13]  The Court states that the decision in National League of Cities "invites an unelected federal judiciary to make decisions about which state policies it favors and which ones its dislikes." Curiously, the Court then suggests that under the application of the "traditional" governmental function analysis, "the States cannot serve as laboratories for social and economic experiment." Ante, at 546, citing Justice Brandeis' famous observation in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  Apparently the Court believes that when "an unelected federal judiciary" makes decisions as to whether a particular function is one for the Federal or State Governments, the States no longer may engage in "social and economic experiment."

 [Additionally,] the proportion of people actually involved from the total population tends to be greater, the lower the level of government, and this, of course, better approximates the citizen participation ideal." ACIR, Citizen Participation in the American Federal System 95 (1980).  Moreover, we have witnessed in recent years the rise of numerous special interest groups that engage in sophisticated lobbying, and make substantial campaign contributions to some Members of Congress.  These groups are thought to have significant influence in the shaping and enactment of certain types of legislation.  Contrary to the Court's view, a "political process" that functions in this way is unlikely to safeguard the sovereign rights of States and localities.  See n. 9, supra. [19]  The opinion of the Court in National League of Cities makes clear that the very essence of a federal system of government is to impose "definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power." <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 842</citedDecision> .  See also the Court's opinion in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 547, n. 7 (1975).  [20]  As Justice Douglas observed in his dissent in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 203 , extension of the FLSA to the States could "disrupt the fiscal policy of the States and threaten their autonomy in the regulation of health and education." [21]  In Long Island R. Co. the unanimous Court recognized that "[t]his Court's emphasis on traditional governmental functions and traditional aspects of state sovereignty was not meant to impose a static historical view of state functions generally immune from federal regulation." 455 U. S., at 686.
