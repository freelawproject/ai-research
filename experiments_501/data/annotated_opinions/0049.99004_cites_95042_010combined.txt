**Combined Opinion**
 It is well known that there have grown up near to all the large cities of this country suburban communities which require this peculiar service, and as to which the railroads have themselves, as in this instance, established commutation rates.  'After such recognition of the propriety and necessity of such service, we see no reason why a State may not regulate the matter, keeping within the limitation of reasonableness.  On the strength of these commutation tariffs, it is a fact of public history that thousands of persons have acquired homes in city suburbs and nearby towns in reliance upon this action of the carriers in fixing special rates and furnishing particular accommodations suitable to the traffic.  This faot has been recognized by the courts of the country, by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and quite generally by the railroad commissions of the States.  1 The question of the power of the Public Service Commission of the State of New York in this respect was before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of *13 that State in People ex rel. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. Public Service Commission, 159 App. Div. Rep., Supreme Court, 531.  In that case it was said: “Subdivision 4 of section 33 of the Public Service Commissions Law (Consol. Laws, chap. 48 [Laws of 1910, chap. 480], as amd. by Laws of 1911, chap. 546) empowers the Commission to fix reasonable and just rates for such service.  It is urged, however, that the statute is invalid under the rule of Lake Shore &c. R. Co. v. Smith ( <citedDecision>173 U. S. 684</citedDecision> ).  In that case the statutes of Michigan had fixed a maximum passenger rate ab three cents per mile.  A subsequent enactment required the issuing of mileage books for 1,000 miles, good for two years, at a less rate.  The court held that having fixed a' uniform maximum rate as to all passengers, such rate was the reasonable compensation for the service, and that the fixing of a less rate to particular individuals was an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of legislative power; that it was not for the convenience of the public and thus within the police power, but was for the convenience of certain individuals who were permitted to travel upon the railroads for less than the reasonable rate prescribed by law; that the law was, therefore, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution in depriving the company of its property without due process of law and by depriving it of the equal protection of the laws.  “In Beardsley v. N. Y., L. E. & W. R. R. Co. ( 162 N. Y. 230 ) the Court of Appeals felt constrained by the Smith case to declare the Mileage Book Law of this State invalid as to companies in existence at the time of its passage, but in Purdy v. Erie R. R. Co. ( 162 N. Y. 43 ) that law was held valid as to companies organized after the statute was passed.  “In Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Kentucky ( 183 U. S. 503 ), after citing the Smith case and like cases, the court says (at p. 511): 'Nor, yet, are we ready to carry the *14 doctrine of the cited cases beyond the limits therein established.’ “In the Minnesota Rate Case (Simpson v. Shepard, 230 U. S. 352 ) the legality of an order of the Commission of that State was recognized which fixed a maximum freight rate and passenger rate, the latter at two cents a mile as the maximum fare for passengers twelve years of age or over, and one cent a mile for those under twelve years of age.  “In Interstate R. Co. v. Massachusetts ( 207 U. S. 79 ) the Massachusetts law prescribing special rates less than the maximum for school children was held valid.
**Combined Opinion**
 It is so universal, of such large proportion, has become so necessary to the public that it cannot be said that the fixing of reasonable and just rates for it is unusual or unreasonable, or the granting of a benefit to individuals and not for convenience to the public.  “Nearly one-half of the passengers handled by the relator at the Grand Central Terminal were of this class.  Perhaps the same ratio would exist upon the other railroads serving the city.  We conclude that the statute in question is valid as conferring a power on the Commission to regulate rates for the public convenience and welfare.” That decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of New'York on the opinion of the Appellate Division.  215 N. Y. 689 : The subject was elaborately considered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the Commutation Rate Case, 211.  C. C. 428, in which the authority of the Commission to fix reasonable rates was sustained.  In the course of the opinion, Commissioner Harlan, speaking for a unanimoris Commission, said: “Another case strongly relied upon by the defendants is L. S. & M. S. R. R. Co. v. Smith, <citedDecision>173 U. S. 699</citedDecision> .  It there appeared that the' legislature of the state of Michigan had fixed the maximum passenger fare to be charged by railroad companies for local journeys within the state.  By a subsequent enactment it required the carriers to sell l^OO-mile tickets for use within the lower peninsula at a price not exceeding $20 and in the upper peninsula at a price not exceeding $25.  Various conditions affecting the *16 use of the tickets were also fixed by the act, and among others that they should be valid, for two years after the date of purchase.  It was held that in the exercise of its general police power a state may-fix maximum farés, but that it may not fix a rate for 1,000-mile tickets that involves a discrimination in favor of those who buy them.' The statute was held to be invalid.  The case, however, involved mileage tickets which, we must repeat, differ very essentially in character from commutation tickets.

 Compared with the normal one-way fare all such tickets may be said to be abnormal.  But the resemblance stops at that point.  Although they *17 are mentioned together in section 22, the force and effect of that provision must necessarily differ with the differing' character of the several kinds of tickets.  It seems to be settled under that section that a carrier may enter upon the policy and practice of issuing mileage books and excursion tickets at less than its regular normal fare for the one-way journey, and, having adopted such a policy, may subsequently withdraw from it and refuse longer to issue such tickets.  That has been the view of this Commission, and is the view generally entertained, although there may be exceptional circumstances where a different conclusion would be required.  It by no means follows, however, that a carrier under section 22 may exercise the same scope and freedom of action with respect to commutation tickets.” The reasoning of these decisions is sound and involves no violation of the Federal Constitution.  True it is that it may not be possible to reconcile these views with all that is said in the opinion delivered for the majority of the court in the case of Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co. v. <citedDecision>Smith, supra.</citedDecision> The views therein expressed which are inconsistent with the right of the States to fix reasonable commutation fares when the carrier has itself established fares for such service, must be regarded as overruled by the decision in this case. We find no error in the decree of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, and the same is Affirmed.
