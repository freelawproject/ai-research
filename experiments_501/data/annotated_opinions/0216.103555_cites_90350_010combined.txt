36 Stat. 1162 .  This provision, based upon § 21 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, 14 Stat. 526 , was inserted in the Act of 1793 by the Revisers.  R.S. § 720; *133 see Proposed Draft of Revision of U.S. Statutes (1872), vol. 1, pp. 418.  (2) Removal of actions.  The Removal Acts, ever since the Act of September 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 73 , 79, have provided that whenever any party entitled to remove a suit shall file with the state court a proper petition for removal and a bond with good and sufficient surety, it shall then be the duty of the state court to accept such petition and bond "and proceed no further in the cause." Section 265 has always been deemed inapplicable to removal proceedings.  Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, <citedDecision>103 U.S. 494</citedDecision> ; Madisonville Traction Co. v. Mining Co., 196 U.S. 239 .  The true rationale of these decisions is that the Removal Acts qualify pro tanto the Act of 1793.  Subsequent decisions have clarified the loose ground advanced in French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250, 253 .  See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U.S. 226 ; Taylor and Willis, The Power of Federal Courts to Enjoin Proceedings in State Courts, 42 Yale L.J. 1169 , 1174-75; compare Bryant v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 92 F.2d 569, 571 .  (3) Limitation of shipowners' liability.  The Act of 1851 limiting the liability of shipowners provides that after a shipowner transfers his interest in the vessel to a trustee for the benefit of the claimants, "all claims and proceedings against the owner or owners shall cease." 9 Stat. 635 , 636.

[14] *148 Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U.S. 189 , followed the established doctrine.  The Riverdale Mills acquired property by judicial sale in the federal court. A state proceeding later was begun by parties to the federal foreclosure alleging the invalidity of the sale and seeking possession of the property.  Riverdale then filed an ancillary bill in the original foreclosure suit for an injunction against prosecution of the state suit.  Against the claimed protection of R.S. § 720 (§ 265 J.C.), p. 193, it was held here that a federal court may "protect the title which it has decreed as against every one a party to the original suit and prevent that party from relitigating the questions of right which have already been determined." P. 195.  It is quite clear that the Court in both the Julian and the Riverdale cases was intent not on protecting a res, since that had long passed from its hands, but on avoiding relitigation by executing its decrees.  This appears particularly from their reliance upon French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250 ; Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, <citedDecision>103 U.S. 494</citedDecision> ; and Sharon v. Terry, 36 F. 337 .  In the French case no res was involved.  It was a federal injunction against the enforcement of a judgment of a state court obtained in a state action after removal of a related but separate state suit.  The reasoning proceeded upon the protection of federal judgments, not on the language of the removal statute.  The same is true of <citedDecision>Dietzsch</citedDecision> .  There a state suit on a replevin bond was enjoined by the federal court because it grew out of a failure to return property awarded in replevin in a state court after the removal of the original replevin suit to the federal court which issued the injunction.  It was there said, p. 497: "A court of the United States is not prevented from enforcing its own judgments by the statute which forbids it to grant a writ of injunction to stay proceedings in a State court." *149 The Court today lays aside Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U.S. 273 (1906), as inapplicable.  The case in our view may be properly cited as a relitigation decision.  It forcefully declares, albeit by alternative ruling, for the position here taken.  A federal court had enjoined a state tax on the ground of unconstitutionality.  The state was a party.  Years later the state brought an action in the state court for the tax which the decree prohibited.  An ancillary bill sought and obtained an injunction from the federal court. This Court said, p. 292, "Indeed, the proposition that the Eleventh Amendment, or section 720 of the Revised Statutes, control a court of the United States in administering relief, although the court was acting in a matter ancillary to a decree rendered in a cause over which it had jurisdiction, is not open for discussion.  Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, <citedDecision>103 U.S. 494</citedDecision> ; Prout v. Starr, 188 U.S. 537 ; Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U.S. 93, 112 ." It cannot fairly be said, we think, that this was not a holding that a federal court has the duty to protect its parties against relitigation.  This seems quite certain when we examine the cases cited which are discussed heretofore in this opinion.  The Terry case, cited under the Riverdale Mills case, supra, is a good illustration of the permeation of our law by the principle of protection of federal decrees by injunctions against prosecuting state suits which relitigate settled issues.  In Sharon v. Terry , a former decree had determined the fraudulent character of a marriage contract, and had enjoined all efforts to establish rights under any of its provisions.  Notwithstanding this decree, a party thereafter sought and obtained a judgment of the highest court of the state determining the marriage contract valid.  There was no plea of res judicata in the state proceedings.

 Consequently, there was no occasion to consider the applicability of § 265.  The "first come, first served" rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr, 188 U.S. 537 , was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U.S. 226, 235 .  Cf. Haines v. Carpenter, 91 U.S. 254, 257 .  [10]  There is no warrant for the assumption that, in the proposals for the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress had before it the "relitigation" exception as settled doctrine, and that by § 265 gave it legislative confirmation.  The Report of the Special Joint Committee on Revision and Codification of the Laws of the United States annotated the Act of 1793 with citations to twenty-six decisions of this Court. Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 470.  Yet no reference was made to four of the five decisions of this Court prior to the Judicial Code which are supposed to justify the "relitigation" doctrine: Root v. Woolworth, 150 U.S. 401 ; Prout v. Starr, 188 U.S. 537 ; Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U.S. 188 ; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U.S. 273 .  (As we have already seen, "removal" cases like French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250 , and Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, <citedDecision>103 U.S. 494</citedDecision> , rest upon an entirely different footing.) None of the reports submitted to Congress contains any discussion of § 5 of the Act of 1793 and the decisions construing it.  See H. Rept. No. 818, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., referring to H. Doc. No. 783, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.; Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.; Final Report of the Commission to Revise and Codify the Laws of the United States (1906), pp. 29, 244.
