The question is whether a state law which revokes the license of a foreign corporation to do business within the State because, while doing only a domestic business in the State, it resorts to the federal court sitting in the State, is constitutional.

Passage 4:
The court below held that the State of Arkansas could not revoke the license of a foreign corporation to do business within its borders because the corporation had resorted to the federal courts sitting within the State.

Florida still recognizes the importance of the concept of relying on a body of one's peers to determine guilt or innocence as a safeguard against arbitrary law enforcement. However, the Court in Williams v. Florida has clarified that the number of jurors does not affect the fairness of the trial and that a smaller jury can still represent a fair cross-section of the community."," Passage:
In the case of Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), the Supreme Court held that a six-person jury in a criminal trial does not violate the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by an impartial jury. The Court reasoned that the number of jurors does not affect the fairness of the trial and that a smaller jury can still represent a fair cross-section of the community.

However, in Duncan v. Louisiana, <targetCase>391 U.S. 145</targetCase> (1968), the Supreme Court had previously held that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right to trial by jury in all criminal cases that would come within the Sixth Amendment's guarantee if they were to be tried in a federal court. The question then is whether the constitutional guarantee of a trial by ""jury"" necessarily requires trial by exactly 12 persons, rather than some lesser number.

In Duncan v. Louisiana, the Court had reviewed the history of the development of trial by jury in criminal cases and found that it revealed a long tradition attaching great importance to the concept of relying on a body of one's peers to determine guilt or innocence as a safeguard against arbitrary law enforcement. However, the Court also found that the history afforded little insight into the considerations that gradually led to the size of the jury being generally fixed at 12.

In Williams v. Florida, the Court concluded that the 12-man requirement is not an indispensable component of the Sixth Amendment and that the essential feature of a jury lies in the interposition between the accused and his accuser of the commonsense judgment of a group of laymen, and in the community participation and shared responsibility that results from that group's determination of guilt or innocence. The Court found that the performance of this role is not a function of the particular number of the body that makes up the jury.

Therefore, based on the passage provided, the Target Case of Duncan v. Louisiana has not been overruled, as the Court in Williams v. Florida still recognizes the importance of the concept of relying on a body of one's peers to determine guilt or innocence as a safeguard against arbitrary law enforcement. However, the Court in Williams v. Florida has clarified that the number of jurors does not affect the fairness of the trial and that a smaller jury can still represent a fair cross-section of the community.

The Target Case is cited as a precedent and is used as a basis for reasoning in the passage.," I am a legal case citator and will determine whether the Target Case has been overruled or not based on the provided passage.

Passage:
""In Chambers v. Maroney, <targetCase>399 U.S. 42</targetCase>, the police found weapons and stolen property 'concealed in a compartment under the dashboard.' No suggestion was made that the scope of the search was impermissible. It would be illogical to assume that the outcome of Chambers — or the outcome of Carroll itself — would have been different if the police had found the secreted contraband enclosed within a secondary container and had opened that container without a warrant. If it was reasonable for prohibition agents to rip open the upholstery in Carroll, it certainly would have been reasonable for them to look into a burlap sack stashed inside; if it was reasonable to open the concealed compartment in Chambers, it would have been equally reasonable to open a paper bag crumpled within it. A contrary rule could produce absurd results inconsistent with the decision in Carroll itself.""

Based on the provided passage, the Target Case (Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42) has not been overruled.

Output:
