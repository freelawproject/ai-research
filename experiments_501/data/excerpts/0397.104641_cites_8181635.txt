**Combined Opinion**
Mr. Justice Rutledge delivered the opinion of the Court. The principal question is whether a lessee of mineral rights in allotted and restricted Indian lands is immunized by the Constitution against payment of nondiscriminatory state gross production taxes and state excise taxes on petroleum produced from such lands.  In effect the issue is whether this Court’s previous decisions in Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U. S. 503 ; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, <citedDecision>248 U. S. 549</citedDecision> ; and Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, 296 U. S. 521 , invalidating such taxes as applied to like lessees, have been so undermined by later decisions, in particular Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376 , that they should now be overruled.  With certain exceptions, 1 the lands from which was extracted the petroleum sought to be taxed are held in *344 trust by the United States, pursuant to allotments made under the General Allotment Act, 2 for various members of the Pottawatomie, Apache, Comanche, and Otoe and Missouria Tribes.  3 All the lands are located within the State of Oklahoma and at all material times they were restricted 4 against alienation by the Indian cestui owners without the consent of the Secretary of the Interior.  5 He *345 approved each of the leases now in question.  The respondents Texas Company (No. 40) and Magnolia Petroleum Company (No. 41) acquired their leases before Oklahoma levied the assessments now in issue, either as original lessees or by assignment from non-Indians who were such lessees.  The companies thus became owners of all right, title and interest in their respective leases, subject only to the one-eighth royalty interest reserved to the Indian lessors, and were such owners at the times of the respective assessments.  It may be taken that they have operated the leases in conformity with the applicable regulations of the Department of the Interior 6 and of the State of Oklahoma, 7 except for the payment of the state taxes in question.
**Combined Opinion**
 Okla. Laws, 1908, *356 c. 71, Art. II, § 6.  The Oklahoma court held that the 1910 reenactment of the statute 25 imposed a property tax. McAlester-Edwards Coal Co. v. Trapp, 43 Okla. 510 .  But the statute, as applied to a lessee of restricted Indian coal lands, was held by this Court to be an occupational tax and so an unconstitutional burden on the lessee, who was held to be an instrumentality of the Federal Government.  Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. Harrison, supra. Next the Court held the lease itself a federal instrumentality immune from state taxation.  Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, supra. The Oklahoma legislature revised the gross production tax statute in 1915 and again in 1916, a principal change being the provision that the tax was in lieu of all other ad valorem taxes.  26 The revised tax was held by the Oklahoma Supreme Court to be a property tax. 27 But this Court rejected that construction sub silentio and invalidated the tax in memorandum opinions citing only the Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. case ( 235 U. S. 292 ) and *357 the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. case ( 240 U. S. 522 ).  Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U. S. 503 ; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, <citedDecision>248 U. S. 549</citedDecision> .  Suspicions that this Court had overlooked the fact that under the revised statute the gross production tax was in lieu of rather than in addition to all other ad valorem property taxes, 28 were dispelled by Mr. Justice Holmes’ remark in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra at 504 — 505, that the statutory change had been noticed and regarded as immaterial.  29 If a gross receipts tax was a burden on the Federal Government “so as to interfere with the performance of its functions, it could not be saved because it was in lieu of a tax upon property or was so characterized.” See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134, 158.  The high-water mark of immunity for non-Indian lessees of restricted and allotted Indian lands came in 1922 when the Gillespie decision, supra, invalidated an Oklahoma net income tax upon income derived by a lessee from sales of his share of oil produced from restricted lands.  The non-Indian lessee’s immunity was last sustained here by Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, supra. That decision held, on application of a rule of strict construction of congressional waivers, that Congress’ express waiver of immunity from gross production taxes on oil produced from the specified Indian lands did not extend to petroleum excise taxes.  The state did not challenge *358 the implied constitutional immunity but pitched its argument on the ground of statutory exemption.  30 The instrumentality doctrine has been applied to confer a correlative immunity upon private lessees of state-owned lands.

 Act of June 20, 1936, 49 Stat. 1542 , as amended, 50 Stat. 188 (to limit the exemption to homesteads), 25 U. S. C. § 412a.  See Cohen, op. cit. supra, at 260-261.  This legislation was sustained and applied in Board of Commissioners v. Sober, 318 U. S. 705 .  25 Okla. Laws, 1910, c. 44, § 6, adding a provision permitting the producer to deduct the amount of royalties paid for the benefit of an Indian tribe.  26 Okla. Laws, 1915, c. 107, Art. 2, subd. A; Okla. Laws, 1916, c. 39.  Further amendments were made by Okla. Laws, 1933, c. 103, and by Okla. Laws, 1935, c. 66, Art. 4.  See note 9 and text supra. 27 Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 63 Okla. 143 , reversed per curiam, <citedDecision>248 U. S. 549</citedDecision> .  In re Gross Production Tax of Wolverine Oil Co., 53 Okla. 24 , which had held that the 1915 Act was an occupational rather than a property tax, was distinguished because of changes made by the 1916 Act.  The Wolverine case was specifically overruled in In re Skelton Lead & Zinc Co.’s Gross Production Tax, 1919, 81 Okla. 134; accord, Bergin Oil & Gas Co. v. Howard, 82 Okla. 176 .  The Oklahoma Supreme Court has since consistently held that the tax is a property tax in lieu of all other ad valorem taxes.  E. g., In re Protest of Bendelari, Agent, 82 Okla. 97 .  And see Meriwether v. Lovett, 166 Okla. 73 ; State v. Indian Royalty Co., 177 Okla. 238 ; Peteet v. Carmichael, 191 Okla. 593 .  28 The Oklahoma Supreme Court assumed for a time that the statutory difference was overlooked by this Court and that an opposite result would have been reached had the difference been noticed.
