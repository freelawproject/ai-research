 That a State washing to engage in cer *515 tain activity must take administrative and sometimes legislative action to comply with federal standards regulating that activity is a commonplace that presents no constitutional defect.  After Garcia , for example, several States and municipalities had to take administrative and legislative action to alter the employment practices or raise the funds necessary to comply with the wage and overtime provisions of the Federal Labor Standards Act.  8 Indeed, even the pre-Garcia line of Tenth Amendment cases recognized that Congress could constitutionally impose federal requirements on States that States could meet only by amending their statutes.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 253-254 , and n. 2 (1983) (Burger, C. J., dissenting) (citing state statutes from over half the States that did not comply with the federal statute upheld by the Court).  Under the NGA’s theory, moreover, any State could immunize its activities from federal regulation by simply codifying the manner in which it engages in those activities.  In short, the NGA’s theory of “commandeering” would not only render Garcia a nullity, but would also restrict congressional regulation of state activities even more tightly than it was restricted under the now overruled National League of Cities line of cases. We find the theory foreclosed by precedent, and uphold the constitutionality of § 310 under the Tenth Amendment.  H — 4 I — I 1 — 1 South Carolina contends that even if a statute banning state bearer bonds entirely would be constitutional, § 310 unconstitutionally violates the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity because it imposes a tax on the interest earned on a state bond. We agree with South Carolina that § 310 is *516 inconsistent with Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., <citedDecision>157 U. S. 429</citedDecision> (1895), which held that any interest earned on a state bond was immune from federal taxation.  The Secretary and the Master, however, suggest that we should uphold the constitutionality of § 310 without explicitly overruling <citedDecision>Pollock</citedDecision> because § 310 does not abolish the tax exemption for state bond interest entirely but rather taxes the interest on state bonds only if the bonds are not issued in the form Congress requires.  In our view, however, this suggestion implicitly rests on a rather mischievous proposition of law. If, for example, Congress imposed a tax that applied exclusively to South Carolina and levied the tax directly on the South Carolina treasury, we would be obligated to adjudicate the constitutionality of that tax even if Congress allowed South Carolina to escape the tax by restructuring its state government in a way Congress found more to its liking.  The United States cannot convert an unconstitutional tax into a constitutional one simply by making the tax conditional.  Whether Congress could have imposed the condition by direct regulation is irrelevant; Congress cannot employ unconstitutional means to reach a constitutional end.  Under <citedDecision>Pollock</citedDecision> , a tax on the interest income derived from any state bond was considered a direct tax on the State and thus unconstitutional.  <citedDecision>157 U. S., at 585-586</citedDecision> .  If this constitutional rule still applies, Congress cannot threaten to tax the interest on state bonds that do not conform to congressional dictates. We thus decline to follow a suggestion that would force us to embrace implicitly a proposition of law far more controversial than the current validity of Pollock’s ban on taxing state bond interest, and proceed to address whether <citedDecision>Pollock</citedDecision> should be explicitly overruled.  9 *517 Under the intergovernmental tax immunity jurisprudence prevailing at the time, <citedDecision>Pollock</citedDecision> did not represent a unique immunity limited to income derived from state bonds.  Rather, <citedDecision>Pollock</citedDecision> merely represented one application of the more general rule that neither the Federal nor the State Governments could tax income an individual directly derived from any contract with another government.  10 Not only was it unconstitutional for the Federal Government to tax a bondowner on the interest he or she received on any state bond, but it was also unconstitutional to tax a state employee on the income earned from his employment contract, Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871), to tax a lessee on income derived from lands leased from a State, Burnet v. Coronado Oil, 285 U. S. 393 (1932), or to impose a sales tax on proceeds a vendor derived from selling a product to a state agency, Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, 283 U. S. 570 (1931).  Income derived from the same kinds of contracts with the Federal Government were likewise immune from taxation by the States.  See Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449 (1829) (federal bond interest immune from state taxation); Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435 (1842) (federal employee immune from state tax on salary); Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501 (1922) (income derived from federal lease immune from state tax); Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U. S. 218 (1928) (vendor immune from sales tax on vendor’s proceeds from sale to the United States).  Cases concerning the tax immunity of income derived from state contracts freely cited principles established in federal tax immunity cases, and vice versa.  See, e. g., *518 Coronado Oil, supra, at 398 ; Indian Motocycle, supra, at 575-579 ; <citedDecision>Pollock, supra, at 586</citedDecision> .  See generally Indian Motocycle, supra, at 575 (immunity of States from federal tax equal to immunity of Federal Government from state tax); Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514, 521-522 (1926); Collector v. Day, supra, at 127 .  This general rule was based on the rationale that any tax on income a party received under a contract with the government was a tax on the contract and thus a tax “on” the government because it burdened the government’s power to enter into the contract.  The Court in <citedDecision>Pollock</citedDecision> borrowed its reasoning directly from the decision in Weston exempting federal bond interest from state taxation: “‘The right to tax the contract to any extent, when made, must operate upon the power to borrow before it is exercised, and have a sensible influence on the contract.  The extent of this influence depends on the will of a distinct government.  To any extent, however inconsiderable, it is a burthen on the operations of government.  .  .  .  The tax on government stock is thought by this court to be a tax on the contract, a tax on the [government’s] power to borrow money .  .  .  and consequently to be repugnant to the Constitution.’” <citedDecision>Pollock, supra, at 586</citedDecision> , quoting Weston, supra, at 467, 468 .  Thus, although a tax was collected from an independent private party, the tax was considered to be “on” the government because the tax burden might be passed on to it through the contract.  This reasoning was used to define the basic scope of both federal and state tax immunities with respect to all types of government contracts.  11 See, e. g., Coronado Oil, *519 supra, at 400-401 (“Here the lease .  .  .  was an instrumentality of the State .... To tax the income of the lessee arising therefrom would amount to an imposition upon the lease itself”); Panhandle Oil, supra, at 222 (“It is immaterial that the seller and not the purchaser is required to report and make payment to the State.

 .’” (quoting Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522, 530 (1916))).  The commonality of the rationale underlying all these immunities for government contracts *520 was highlighted by Indian Motocycle, 283 U. S. 570 (1931).  In that case, the Court reviewed the then current status of intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, observing that a tax on interest earned on a state or federal bond was unconstitutional because it would burden the exercise of the government’s power to borrow money and that a tax on the salary of a State or Federal Government employee was unconstitutional because it would burden the government’s power to obtain the employee’s services.  Id., at 576-578 .  It then concluded that under the same principle a sales tax imposed on a vendor for a sale to a state agency was unconstitutional because it would burden the sale transaction.  Id., at 579 .  The rationale underlying <citedDecision>Pollock</citedDecision> and the general immunity for government contract income has been thoroughly repudiated by modern intergovernmental immunity case law. In Graves v. New York ex rel. O’Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 (1939), the Court announced: “The theory .  .  .  that a tax on income is legally or economically a tax on its source, is no longer tenable.” Id., at 480 .  The Court explained: “So much of the burden of a non-discriminatory general tax upon the incomes of employees of a government, state or national, as may be passed on economically to that government, through the effect of the tax on the price level of labor or materials, is but the normal incident of the organization within the same territory of two governments, each possessing the taxing power.  The burden, so far as it can be said to exist or to affect the government in any indirect or incidental way, is one which the Constitution presupposes .  .

 Overruling Burnet v. Coronado Oil, 285 U. S. 393 (1932), and Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501 (1922), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a federal tax on net income a corporation derived from a state lease in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376 (1938).  See also Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Texas Co., 336 U. S. 342 (1949) (upholding constitutionality of state tax on gross income derived from Indian lease).  Later, the Court explicitly overruled Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871), and upheld the constitutionality of a nondiscriminatory state tax on the salary of a federal employee.  Graves v. New York ex rel. O’ Keefe, supra. 12 And in the course of upholding a sales tax on a cost-plus Government contractor, the Court in King & Boozer overruled Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U. S. 218 (1928).  See also James, supra (upholding state tax on gross income independent contractor received from Federal Government).  The only premodern tax immunity for parties to government contracts that has so far avoided being explicitly overruled is the immunity for recipients of governmental bond interest.  13 That this Court *523 has yet to overrule <citedDecision>Pollock</citedDecision> explicitly, however, is explained not by any distinction between the income derived from government bonds and the income derived from other government contracts, but by the historical fact that Congress has always exempted state bond interest from taxation by statute, beginning with the very first federal income tax statute.  Act of Oct. 3, 1913, ch. 16, § II(B), 38 Stat. 168 .  In sum, then, under current intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine the States can never tax the United States directly but can tax any private parties with whom it does business, even though the financial burden falls on the United States, as long as the tax does not discriminate against the United States or those with whom it deals.  See Washington, supra, at 540 ; County of Fresno, supra, at 460-463 ; City of Detroit, supra, at 473 ; Oklahoma Tax Comm’n, supra, at 359-364.  A tax is considered to be directly on the Federal Government only “when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities.” New Mexico, supra, at 735 .  The rule with respect to state tax immunity is essentially the same, see, e. g., Graves, supra, at 485 ; Mountain Producers Corp., supra, at 386-387, except that at least some nondiscriminatory federal taxes can be collected directly from the States even though a parallel state tax could not be collected directly from the Federal Government.  14 See generally n. 11, supra. *524 We thus confirm that subsequent case law has overruled the holding in <citedDecision>Pollock</citedDecision> that state bond interest is immune from a nondiscriminatory federal tax. We see no constitutional reason for treating persons who receive interest on government bonds differently than persons who receive income from other types of contracts with the government, and no tenable rationale for distinguishing the costs imposed on States by a tax on state bond interest from the costs imposed *525 by a tax on the income from any other state contract.  We stated in Graves that “as applied to the taxation of salaries of the employees of one government, the purpose of the immunity was not to confer benefits on the employees by relieving them from contributing their share of the financial support of the other government, whose benefits they enjoy, or to give an advantage to a government by enabling it to engage employees at salaries lower than those paid for like services by other employers, public or private .  .  .  .” 306 U. S., at 483 .  Likewise, the owners of state bonds have no constitutional entitlement not to pay taxes on income they earn from state bonds, and States have no constitutional entitlement to issue bonds paying lower interest rates than other issuers.  15 *526 Indeed, this Court has in effect acknowledged that a holder of a Government bond could constitutionally be taxed on bond interest in Memphis Bank & Trust Co. v. Garner, 459 U. S. 392 (1983), which involved a state tax on federal bond interest.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Chief Justice Rehnquist, concurring in the judgment.  Today the Court reaches two results regarding § 310(b)(1) of TEFRA that I believe are analytically distinct.  First, the Court finds that § 310(b)(1) does not violate the Tenth Amendment by compelling States to issue bonds in registered form.  Second, the majority concludes that the statute *529 also does not contravene the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity; in doing so, the majority overrules our decision in Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., <citedDecision>157 U. S. 429</citedDecision> (1895).  While I agree that the principles of intergovernmental tax immunity are not threatened in this case, in my view, the Court unnecessarily casts doubt on the protective scope of the Tenth Amendment in the course of upholding §310 (b)(1).  The Special Master appointed by the Court made a number of factual determinations about the impact that the TEFRA registration requirements would have upon the States.  Most notably, the Special Master found that the registration requirements have had no substantive effect on the abilities of States to raise debt capital, on the political processes by which States decide to issue debt, or on the power of the States to choose the purpose to which they will dedicate the proceeds of their tax-exempt borrowing.  After an exhaustive investigation, the Special Master summarized: “TEFRA has not changed how much the States borrow, for what purposes they borrow, how they decide to borrow, or any other obviously important aspect of the borrowing process.” Report of Special Master 118.  This well-supported conclusion that § 310(b)(1) has had a de minimis impact on the States should end, rather than begin, the Court’s constitutional inquiry.  Even the more expansive conception of the Tenth Amendment espoused in National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), recognized that only congressional action that “operate[s] to directly displace the States’ freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions,” runs afoul of the authority granted Congress.

**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice O’Connor, dissenting.  The Court today overrules a precedent that it has honored for nearly 100 years and expresses a willingness to cancel the constitutional immunity that traditionally has shielded the interest paid on state and local bonds from federal taxation.  Henceforth the ability of state and local governments to finance their activities will depend in part on whether Congress voluntarily abstains from tapping this permissible source of additional income tax revenue.  I believe that state autonomy is an important factor to be considered in reviewing the National Government’s exercise of its enumerated powers.  Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 581 (1985) (O’Connor, J., joined by Powell and Rehnquist, JJ., dissenting).  I dissent from the decision to overrule Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., <citedDecision>157 U. S. 429</citedDecision> (1895), and I would invalidate Congress’ attempt to regulate the sovereign States by threatening to deprive them of this tax immunity, which would increase their dependence on the National Government.  Section 310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), 26 U. S. C. § 103 (j)(1), provides that the interest paid on state and local bonds will be subject to federal income tax unless the bonds are issued in registered form.  The Court readily concludes that Congress could have prohibited outright the issuance of bearer bonds without violating the Tenth Amendment.  Ante, at 511-513.  But regardless of whether Congress could have required registration of the bonds directly under its commerce power, I agree with the Court that Congress may not accomplish the same end by an unconstitutional means.  Ante, at 515-516.  *531 In my view, the Tenth Amendment and principles of federalism inherent in the Constitution prohibit Congress from taxing or threatening to tax the interest paid on state and municipal bonds.
