 Cf. Ex parte Baldwin, 291 U. S. 610, 615 .  For similar reasons we need not here consider cases like Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 , and Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273 , with which compare Hale v. Bimco Trading Co., 306 U. S. 375, 378 .  The Court also held that in a foreclosure proceeding the complainant cannot join a third person who claims adversely to the mortgagor and mortgagee, and that consequently there was a misjoinder of parties.  96 U. S. at 341 .  These grounds for decision were, of course, alternative, and either alone was sufficient to dispose of the case. However, they were entirely separate and distinct, and there *138 is no basis for any inference that the Court might have upheld an injunction if Reynolds had been properly joined.  Nor need we consider common-law refinements in actions for ejectment, for the Court went explicitly on its duty to obey the Act of 1793.  Root v. Woolworth, <citedDecision>150 U. S. 401</citedDecision> , is erroneously regarded as illustrating a “relitigation” exception to § 265.  The case holds merely that courts of equity have jurisdiction to “effectuate their own decrees by injunctions or writs of assistance in order to avoid the relitigation of questions once settled between the same parties.” <citedDecision>150 U. S. at 411-12</citedDecision> .  The Court did not uphold a federal injunction against a state suit to relitigate a claim already settled by a previous federal decree — no such state suit had been brought.  Consequently, there was no occasion to consider the applicability of § 265.  The “first come, first served” rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537 , was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U. S. 226, 235 .  Cf. Haines v. Carpenter, 91 U. S. 254, 257 .  There is no warrant for the assumption that, in the proposals for the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress had before it the “relitigation” exception as settled doctrine, and that by § 265 gave it legislative confirmation.  The Report of the Special Joint Committee on Revision and Codification of the Laws of the United States annotated the Act of 1793 with citations to twenty-six decisions of this Court. Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 470.  Yet no reference was made to four of the five decisions of this Court prior to the *140 Judicial Code which are supposed to justify the “relitigation” doctrine: Ro ot v. Woolworth, <citedDecision>150 U. S. 401</citedDecision> ; Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537 ; Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U. S. 188 ; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273 .  (As we have already seen, “removal” cases like French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250 , and Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U. S. 494 , rest upon an entirely different footing.) None of the reports submitted to Congress contains any discussion of § 5 of the Act of 1793 and the decisions construing it.  See H. Rept. No. 818, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., referring to H. Doc. No. 783, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.; Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.; Final Report of the Commission to Revise and Codify the Laws of the United States (1906), pp. 29, 244.  Nor do the debates disclose any consideration of the question.  See 45 Cong. Rec., pts. Ill and IV, and 46 Cong. Rec., pts. I-V, passim.
