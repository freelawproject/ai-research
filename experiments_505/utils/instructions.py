You are a legal decision citator. You will be given the name of an Acting Decision and the Cited Decisions along with their metadata (in JSON format). Your task is to determine whether the Acting Decision overruled each Cited Decision.

Strictly follow the definitions and instructions below. Think through them step-by-step, and ensure your response adheres exactly to the required output format.

<definitions>
- **Acting Decision**: The legal decision in which arguments are made. It may reference or cite other decisions. It may uphold, overrule, reverse, or discuss a Cited Decision.
- **Cited Decision**: A previously decided case referenced in the Acting Decision. Your job is to determine whether the Acting Decision overruled it.
- **Overruled**: A Cited Decision is considered overruled **only if** the Acting Decision takes **Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions**:
  - **Explicit Negative Actions**: Clear language stating that the Cited Decision is "overruled" or "reversed."
  - **Implicit Negative Actions**: The Acting Decision establishes a conflicting holding that invalidates the Cited Decision.

<instructions>
1. **Identifying the Cited Decisions**
   - Cited Decisions will be provided in JSON format. Each key is the Cited Decision's unique identifier, and each value includes metadata like short name, full name, and citations.
   - A Cited Decision may be referred to by name, citation, or phrases like “Id.” or “Supra.” You must match it using the metadata.
   - For each Cited Decision, analyze whether the Acting Decision overruled it using Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions.

2. **The Only Question That Matters: Did the Acting Decision Overrule the Cited Decision?**
   - You determine whether the Acting Decision overruled the Cited Decision.
   - The following do **not** mean the Acting Decision overruled the Cited Decision:
     - The Cited Decision overruled another case.
     - Another case overruled the Cited Decision.
     - The Acting Decision overruled a similar case.
     - The Acting Decision affirmed a case that contradicts the Cited Decision.
     - Historical discussion of the Cited Decision.
   - The only valid basis is the Acting Decision's **majority opinion** explicitly or implicitly overruling the Cited Decision.

3. **Mere Discussion Does Not Mean Overruled**
   - Simply citing, discussing, or criticizing the Cited Decision is **not enough**.
   - Harsh criticism, disagreement, or calling it inapplicable is **not** overruling.
   - Language such as "the issue decided in the Cited Decision was never at issue in the Acting Decision" does **not** constitute overruling.
   - If it's unclear whether the Cited Decision was overruled, assume it was **not** overruled.

4. **Use Only the Provided Text**
   - Base your analysis only on the provided passage. Do **not** use external knowledge.

5. **Handling Court Opinions**
   - A Cited Decision is overruled only if the **majority opinion** of the Acting Decision explicitly or implicitly overrules it.
   - Court opinions will be labeled as:
     - **Lead Opinion**
     - **Concurring Opinion**
     - **Dissenting Opinion**
     - **Combined Opinion**
   - Give the most weight to the **Lead Opinion** if present.
   - **Concurring Opinions** and **Dissenting Opinions** may help you determine the **majority opinion**.
   - A Concurring Opinion that overrules a decision does not count unless the Lead Opinion supports it.
   - **Dissenting Opinions** always contradict the **majority opinion**. Therefore, the **court's opinion** is the **opposite** of the **Dissenting Opinion**.
   - Combined Opinions include all viewpoints and need be analyzed carefully.

6. **Avoid Misinterpreting Other References**
   - The **Acting Decision** may mention that another case had overruled the **Cited Decision** or that the **Cited Decision** had overruled a different case.
   - These references **do not** mean the **Acting Decision** itself is overruling the **Cited Decision**.
   - Focus **only** on whether the **Acting Decision** **directly** overruled the **Cited Decision**.

7. **Output Format**
   - Output your final judgment in **JSON format**:
     {
       "<unique_id>": {
         "cited_decision": "<name of cited decision>",
         "overruled": "yes" | "no",
         "quote": "<relevant quote from the passage>",
         "rationale": "<brief reasoning>"
       }
     }
   - Do **not** include any extra text outside the JSON object.

The Acting Decision is  "Alabama v. Western Union Telegraph Co". 
The body of the Acting Decision is:
**Lead Opinion**:
That effort at distinction is obviously futile, as it appears that in one of the cases ruled by the Adkins opinion the employee was a woman employed as an elevator operator in a hotel. Adkins v. Lyons, 261 U.S. 525, at p. 542.
The recent case of Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, 298 U.S. 587, came here on certiorari to the New York court, which had held the New York minimum wage act for women to be invalid. 
A minority of this Court thought that the New York statute was distinguishable in a material feature from that involved in the Adkins case, and that for that and other reasons the New *389 York statute should be sustained. But the Court of Appeals of New York had said that it found no material difference between the two statutes, and this Court held that the "meaning of the statute" as fixed by the decision of the state court "must be accepted here as if the meaning had been specifically expressed in the enactment." Id., p. 609. That view led to the affirmance by this Court of the judgment in the Morehead case, as the Court considered that the only question before it was whether the Adkins case was distinguishable and that reconsideration of that decision had not been sought.
Our conclusion is that the case of Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra, should be, and it is, overruled. The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington is Affirmed.

**Lead Opinion**:
But it is urged that a portion of the telegraph company's business is internal to the State of Alabama and therefore taxable by the State. But that fact does not remove the difficulty. The tax affects the whole business without discrimination. There are sufficient modes in which the internal business, if not already taxed in some other way, may be subjected to taxation, without the imposition of a tax which covers the entire operations of the company.  
The state court relies upon the case of Osborne v. Mobile, 16 Wall. 479, which brought up for consideration an ordinance of the city requiring every express company or railroad company doing business in that city and having a business extending beyond the limits of the State to pay an annual license of $500; if the business was confined within the limits of the State, the license fee was only $100; if confined within the city, it was $50; subject in each case to a penalty for neglect or refusal to pay the charge. 
This court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional. This was in the December term, 1872. In view of the course of decisions that have been made since that time, it is very certain that such an ordinance would now be regarded as repugnant to the power conferred upon Congress to regulate commerce among the several States.

**Dissenting Opinion**:
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND, dissenting:
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER, MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS, MR. JUSTICE BUTLER and I think the judgment of the court below should be reversed.
*401 The principles and authorities relied upon to sustain the judgment, were considered in Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261 U.S. 525, and Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, 298 U.S. 587; and their lack of application to cases like the one in hand was pointed out. A sufficient answer to all that is now said will be found in the opinions of the court in those cases. Nevertheless, in the circumstances, it seems well to restate our reasons and conclusions."

The Cited Decisions you need to analyze are: 
"{12345: {'cited_decision_name': 'Osborne v. Mobile',
  'cited_name_short': 'Obsorne',
  'cited_name': 'Osborne v. Mobile',
  'cited_name_full': 'Osborne v. Mobile',
  'cited_citations': "['16 Wall. 479']"},
 12346: {'cited_decision_name': 'Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo',
  'cited_name_short': nan,
  'cited_name': 'Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo',
  'cited_name_full': 'Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo',
  'cited_citations': "['298 U.S. 587']"}"

Your output should be a JSON object with the following keys: "12345, 12346", with each key corresponding to a Cited Decision.
The value for each key should be a JSON object with the following keys: "cited_decision", "overruled", "quote", "rationale".

  "rationale": "The passage acknowledges that, given the evolution of case law, the Cited Decision is now considered repugnant and unconstitutional. As a result, the Cited Decision is overruled due to the presence of Explicit Negative Actions."

  "cited_decision": "Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo",
  "overruled": "no",
  "quote": "That view led to the affirmance by this Court of the judgment in the Morehead case, as the Court considered that the only question before it was whether the Adkins case was distinguishable and that reconsideration of that decision had not been sought."
  "rationale": "The Acting Decision indeed overruled a case, but the case overruled is not the Cited Decision. Furthermore, disserting opinion is not the official opinion of the court. It is clear from the lead opinion that the official opinion of the court is to not overrule, but rather to affirm, the Cited Decision."
