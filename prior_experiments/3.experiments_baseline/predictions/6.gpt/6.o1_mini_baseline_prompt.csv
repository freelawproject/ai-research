Furthermore, Passage 2 explicitly states that 'Trupiano was pro tanto overruled,' indicating that part of Harris's precedent was overturned. Additionally, Passage 2 notes that Harris was reaffirmed later in Rabinowitz, implying that while some aspects were overruled, others remained good law. These elements satisfy conditions 3 and 4 of the overruling criteria, where the court overrules or qualifies part of the case and limits its application to certain circumstances.""

  ""rationale"": ""The court effectively overrules Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U.S. 504 (1896), as evidenced by multiple passages. Specifically, the court states that Race Horse has been qualified by later decisions and ultimately declares that Race Horse is effectively overruled sub silentio (without explicit statement). Additionally, the court emphasizes that treaty rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty, directly contradicting Race Horse's holding that such rights do not survive statehood. These points satisfy several overruling conditions, particularly condition 2 (functionally equivalent language) and condition 3 (overruling part of the case).""
