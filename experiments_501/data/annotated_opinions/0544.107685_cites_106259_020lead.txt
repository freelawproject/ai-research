 Id., at 288.  Among the proposed amendments- adopted by the House of Representatives in 1789 and submitted to the Senate was Article Fourteen: “No State shall infringe the right of trial by Jury in criminal cases, nor the rights of conscience, nor the freedom of speech, or of the press.” The Senate deleted this article in adopting the amendments which became the Bill of Rights.  Journal of the First Session of the Senate 72; 1 Annals of Congress 76; Brennan, The Bill of Rights and the States, in E. Cahn, The Great Rights 65, 69 (1963) ; E. Dumbauld, The Bill of Rights 46, 215 (1957).  This relatively clear indication that the framers of the Sixth Amendment did not intend its jury trial requirement to bind the States is, of course, of little relevance to interpreting the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted specifically to place limitations upon the States.

United States, 380 U. S. 24, 31 (1965).  “The first object of any tyrant in Whitehall would be to make Parliament utterly subservient to his will; and the next to overthrow or diminish trial by jury, for no tyrant could afford to leave *156 a subject’s freedom in the hands of twelve of his countrymen.
