Recently, however, this Court has "increasingly looked to the specific guarantees of the [Bill of Rights] to determine whether a state criminal trial was conducted with due process of law." Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 , 18 (1967). In an increasing number of cases, the Court "has rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a `watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights . . . .' " Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 , 10-11 (1964). [12] Only last Term we found that the right to trial by jury in criminal cases was "fundamental to the American scheme of justice," Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 , 149 (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. [13] For the same reasons, we today find that the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents a fundamental ideal in our constitutional heritage, and that it should apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Insofar as it is inconsistent with this holding, Palko v. Connecticut is overruled. Palko represented an approach to basic constitutional rights which this Court's recent decisions have rejected. It was cut of the same cloth as Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455 (1942), the case which held that a criminal defendant's right to counsel was to be determined by deciding in each case whether the denial of that right was "shocking to the universal sense of justice." Id., at 462. It *795 relied upon Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78 (1908), which held that the right against compulsory self-incrimination was not an element of Fourteenth Amendment due process. Betts was overruled by Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963); Twining, by Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964). Our recent cases have thoroughly rejected the Palko notion that basic constitutional rights can be denied by the States as long as the totality of the circumstances does not disclose a denial of "fundamental fairness." Once it is decided that a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is "fundamental to the American scheme of justice," Duncan v. Louisiana, supra , at 149, the same constitutional standards apply against both the State and Federal Governments. Palko 's roots had thus been cut away years ago. We today only recognize the inevitable. The fundamental nature of the guarantee against double jeopardy can hardly be doubted. Its origins can be traced to Greek and Roman times, and it became established in the common law of England long before this Nation's independence.

II. Having concluded that the writ should be dismissed, I would ordinarily not go further. However, as indicated at the outset, I feel impelled to continue with *808 some observations respecting what can only be regarded as a complete overruling of one of this Court's truly great decisions, and with an expression of my views as to how petitioner's claim respecting his retrial for larceny should fare under the traditional due process approach. A. I would hold, in accordance with Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 (1937), that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not take over the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth, as such. Today Palko becomes another casualty in the so far unchecked march toward "incorporating" much, if not all, of the Federal Bill of Rights into the Due Process Clause. This march began, with a Court majority, in 1961 when Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 , was decided and, before the present decision, found its last stopping point in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968), decided at the end of last Term. I have at each step in the march expressed my opposition, see, e. g., my opinions in Mapp v. Ohio, supra, at 672 (dissenting); Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23 , 44 (1963) (concurring in result); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 , 14 (1964) (dissenting); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 , 408 (1965) (concurring in result); Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609 , 615 (1965) (concurring); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213 , 226 (1967) (concurring in result); and Duncan v. Louisiana, supra , at 171 (dissenting); more particularly in the Duncan case I undertook to show that the "selective incorporation" doctrine finds no support either in history or in reason. [12] Under the pressures of the closing days of *809 the Term, I am content to rest on what I have written in prior opinions, save to raise my voice again in protest against a doctrine which so subtly, yet profoundly, is eroding many of the basics of our federal system. More broadly, that this Court should have apparently become so impervious to the pervasive wisdom of the constitutional philosophy embodied in Palko, and that it should have felt itself able to attribute to the perceptive and timeless words of Mr. Justice Cardozo nothing more than a "watering down" of constitutional rights, are indeed revealing symbols of the extent to which we are weighing anchors from the fundamentals of our constitutional system. B. Finally, how should the validity of petitioner's larceny conviction be judged under Palko, that is, under due process standards? A brief recapitulation of the facts first seems advisable. Petitioner was indicted and tried simultaneously for burglary and larceny.

[7] Cf., e. g., Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40 , 55-56 (1968). [8] See Supplementary Brief for Respondent 20, n. 6. [9] So far as I have been able to discover, there is no State in which petitioner's larceny conviction could have habitual offender consequences. [10] See, e. g., Cichos v. Indiana, 385 U.S. 76 (1966); Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, 379 U.S. 306 (1964); Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 226 (1964); Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740 (1961); Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, 349 U.S. 70 (1955). [11] See, e. g., United States v. Gainey, 380 U.S. 63 (1965); Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109 (1959). [12] In the interest of strict accuracy, it should be pointed out that MR. JUSTICE STEWART cannot and does not fully join in the above sentence of this opinion. He joined my dissenting opinion in Duncan v. Louisiana, supra , but wrote a separate memorandum in Mapp v. Ohio, supra, at 672; joined the opinion of Mr. Justice Clark in Ker v. California, supra ; joined MR. JUSTICE WHITE'S dissenting opinion in Malloy v. Hogan, supra, at 33; wrote an opinion concurring in the result in Pointer v. Texas, supra, at 409; wrote a dissenting opinion in Griffin v. California, supra , at 617; and separately concurred in the result in Klopfer v. North Carolina, supra, at 226. [13] The "double jeopardy" concept has been an established part of the English common law since at least 1700, and was contained in the constitutions or common law of many American jurisdictions prior to 1787. See J. Sigler, Double Jeopardy 1-37 (1969); Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121 , 151-155 (1959) (BLACK, J., dissenting). [14] See Sigler, supra, at 77-117. [15] In the federal realm, the Trono decision was, of course, limited to its "peculiar factual setting" by Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184 , 197 (1957), in which I joined the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, id., at 198. MR. JUSTICE STEWART was not a member of the Court at the time Green was decided. [16] Trono was the only federal decision cited by the State of Georgia in its brief in Brantley.
