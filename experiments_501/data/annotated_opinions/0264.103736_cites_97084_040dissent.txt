That Clause should no more be read “with literal exactness like a mathematical formula” than are other great and general clauses of the Constitution placing limitations upon the States to weld us into a Nation.  Cf. Home Bldg. & L. Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 428 .  Rather it should be construed to harmonize its direction “with the necessary residuum of state power.” Id., at p. 435.  Prominent in the residuum of state power, as pointed out above, is the right of a state to deal with the marriage relations of its citizens and to pursue its chosen domestic policy of public morality in that connection.  Both Nevada and North Carolina have rights in this regard which are entitled to recognition.  The conflict between those rights here should not be resolved by extending into North Carolina the effects of Nevada’s action through a perfunctory application of the literal language of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, with the result that measures which North Carolina has adopted to safeguard the welfare of her citizens in this area of legitimate governmental concern are undermined.  When the interests are considered, those of North Carolina are of sufficient validity that they should as clearly free her of the compulsions of the Full Faith and Credit Clause as did the interest of the state in the devolution of property within its boundaries in Fall v. Eastin, <citedDecision>215 U. S. 1</citedDecision> ; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U. S. 386 , and Hood v. McGehee, 237 U. S. 611 , or the interests of a state in the application of its own workmen’s compensation statute in Alaska Packers Assn. v. Comm’n, supra, or its interest in declining to enforce the penal laws of another jurisdiction, cf. Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657, 666 , all of which seem to be matters of far less concern to a state than the untrammeled enforcement within its borders of those standards of public morality with regard to the marriage relation which it considers to be in the best interests of its citizens.  *311 There is an element of tragic incongruity in the fact that an individual may be validly divorced in one state but not in another.  But our dual system of government and the fact that we have no uniform laws on many subjects give rise to other incongruities as well — for example, the common law took the logical position that an individual could have but one domicile at a time, but this Court has nevertheless said that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not prevent conflicting state decisions on the question of an individual’s domicile.  Cf. Worcester County Co. v. Riley, 302 U. S. 292, 299 .  In the absence of a uniform law on the subject of divorce, this Court is not so limited in its application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause that it must force Nevada’s policy upon North Carolina, any more than it must compel Nevada to accept North Carolina’s requirements.  The fair result is to leave each free to regulate within its own area the rights of its own citizens.  Mr. Justice Jackson, dissenting: I cannot join in exerting the judicial power of the Federal Government to compel the State of North Carolina to subordinate its own law to the Nevada divorce decrees.

 It is difficult to find that it has point now that the shoe is on the other foot.  In any event, I had supposed that our judicial responsibility is for the regularity of the law, not for the regularity of pedigrees.  It was twenty years before Professor Beale could justify the decision to his satisfaction.  Compare Haddock Revisited, 39 Harvard Law Review 417, with Beale, Constitutional Protection of Decrees for Divorce, 19 Harvard Law Review 586.  Others seem to lack his capacity for quick adjustment.  Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714 ; Riverside & Dan River Cotton Mills v. Meneffee, 237 U. S. 189 ; cf. McDonald v. Mabee, 243 U. S. 90 ; Flexner v. Farson, 248 U. S. 289 ; Doherty & Co. v. Goodman, 294 U. S. 623 ; Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457 .  Cf. Arndt v. Griggs, 134 U. S. 316 ; Dewey v. Des Moines, 173 U. S. 193 ; Fall v. Eastin, <citedDecision>215 U. S. 1</citedDecision> ; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U. S. 386 ; Hood v. McGehee, 237 U. S. 611 ; Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U. S. 385 ; Clark v. Williard, 294 U. S. 211 ; Pink v. A. A. A. Highway Express Co., 314 U. S. 201 .  Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, 286 U. S. 276, 279 ; New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, 300 U. S. 308, 313 ; Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463-464 ; Skiriotes v. Florida, 313 U. S. 69 .  Cf. Arndt v. Griggs; Dewey v. Des Moines; Grannis v. Ordean; Clark v. Williard, supra, note 3 .  A spouse who appears and contests the jurisdiction of the court of another state to grant a divorce may not collaterally attack its findings of domicile- and jurisdiction made after such appearance.  Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32 .  So also, a deserter from the matrimonial domicile may be bound by a divorce granted by a court of the state where the matrimonial domicile is situated.  Whether fault on the part of the deserter is an essential seems on the basis of our cases on -jurisdiction *320 for divorce to be an open question; Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S. 155 ; Haddock v. Haddock, supra, at 570, 572, 583 ; and Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551 ; but our decisions on analogous problems might be found to afford adequate support for a decision that it is not.
