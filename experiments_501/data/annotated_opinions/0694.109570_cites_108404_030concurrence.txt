**Concurrence Opinion**
 .  .  .‚Äù California v. LaRue, supra, at 120 n. (concurring opinion).  The disparity created by these Oklahoma statutes amounts to total irrationality.  For the statistics upon which the State now relies, whatever their other shortcomings, wholly fail to prove or even suggest that 3.2% beer is somehow more deleterious when it comes into the hands of a male aged 18-20 than of a female of like age.  The disparate statutory treatment of the sexes here, without even a colorably valid justification or explanation, thus amounts to invidious discrimination.  See Reed v. Reed, <citedDecision>404 U. S. 71</citedDecision> .
