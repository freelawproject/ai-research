 There are adequate precedents directly in point and others which recognize that the rule exists and is sound.  Some at one time involved a res. A number applied the same rule when a res was never in the hands of the court. Not a case nor a text book is cited to support the Court’s present position.  No articles in periodicals suggest the propriety or desirability of so positive a change, except a single query as to the logic of the relitigation development.  19 Though the Judicial Code received careful analysis before adoption, 20 no language was inserted to disavow the settled con-, struction of the reenacted section.  Dial v. Reynolds, 96 U. S. 340 , said by the Court to be a “relitigation” case, did not involve a decree.  In a federal suit to quiet title an injunction was sought to forbid a state action in ejectment.  It is in line with Kline v. Burke Construction Co., <citedDecision>260 U. S. 226</citedDecision> , but not even persuasive on the question of re-litigation or execution of decrees.  We turn now briefly to the original and auxiliary decrees in the two cases under consideration.  In the Toucey case, his suit in equity against the insurance company for restoration of an insurance policy and payments for benefits under it on the ground of the fraud of the company was decided against Toucey.  An assignee of Toucey’s in privity with him sought to relitigate the same issues in a state court. The federal court which entered the original decree enjoined on supplemental bill “retrial, reconsideration or readjudication” of the settled issues and the prosecution of the state action.  21 *154 In the Iowa-Wisconsin Bridge Co. case, a decree, invalidating a certain mortgage and bonds issued in consideration of claimed indebtedness after protracted litigation, was entered December 1, 1936, in a mortgage foreclosure suit brought in a federal court by the bondholders.  This decree became final.  22 Thereafter parties to the proceedings sought to litigate, in the state courts of Delaware, the validity of certain items of the indebtedness which are alleged to form the basis for the bond issue and to have been invalidated by the former federal decree.

While it is true that those courts were enforcing foreclosure, that purpose had been accomplished and the enjoined state suits sought relitigation of closed issues.  James v. Central Trust Co., 98 F. 489 (1899), modifying Central Trust Co. v. Western N. C. R. Co., 89 F. 24 (1898); State Trust Co. v. Kansas City, P. & G. R. Co., 110 F. 10 (1901); Central Trust Co. v.

There are instances of the recognition of the power to prevent relitigation despite R. S. § 720 though the power was not actually exercised.  Chicago, R. I.
