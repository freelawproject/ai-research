<p id="b853-5">As part of a longstanding school-aid program known as Chapter 2, the Federal Government distributes funds to state and local governmental agencies, which in turn lend educational materials and equipment to public and private schools, with the enrollment of each participating school determining the amount of aid that it receives. The question is whether Chapter 2, as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, is a law respecting an establishment of religion, because many of the private schools receiving Chapter 2 aid in that parish are religiously affiliated. We hold that Chapter 2 is not such a law.</p>

<p id="b853-7">A</p>
<p id="b853-8">Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981, <span class="citation no-link">Pub. L. 97-35, 95</span> Stat. 469, as amended, 20 TJ. S. C. §§ 7301-7373,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has its origins in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), <span class="citation no-link">Pub. L. 89-10, 79</span> Stat. 55, and is a close cousin of the provision of the ESEA <page-number citation-index="1" label="802">*802</page-number>that we recently considered in <em>Agostini </em>v. <em>Felton, </em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">521 U. S. 203</a></span> (1997). Like the provision at issue in <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span>, </em>Chapter 2 channels federal funds to local educational agencies (LEA’s), which are usually public school districts, via state educational agencies (SEA’s), to implement programs to assist children in elementary and secondary schools. Among other things, Chapter 2 provides aid</p>
<blockquote id="b854-5">“for the acquisition and use of instructional and educational materials, including library services and materials (including media materials), assessments, reference materials, computer software and hardware for instructional use, and other curricular materials.” <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 7351</span>(b)(2).</blockquote>
<p id="b854-6">LEA’s and SEA’s must offer assistance to both public and private schools (although any private school must be nonprofit). §§ 7312(a), 7372(a)(1). Participating private schools receive Chapter 2 aid based on the number of children enrolled in each school, see § 7372(a)(1), and allocations of Chapter 2 funds for those schools must generally be “equal (consistent with the number of children to be served) to expenditures for programs . . . for children enrolled in the public schools of the [LEA],” § 7372(b). LEA’s must in all cases “assure equitable participation” of the children of private schools “in the purposes and benefits” of Chapter 2. § 7372(a)(1); see § 7372(b). Further, Chapter 2 funds may only “supplement and, to the extent practical, increase the level of funds that would ... be made available from non-Federal sources.” § 7371(b). LEA’s and SEA’s may not operate their programs “so as to supplant funds from non-Federal sources.” <em>Ibid.</em></p>
<p id="b854-7">Several restrictions apply to aid to private schools. Most significantly, the “services, materials, and equipment” provided to private schools must be “secular, neutral, and non-ideological.” § 7372(a)(1). In addition, private schools may not acquire control of Chapter 2 funds or title to Chapter 2 <page-number citation-index="1" label="803">*803</page-number>materials, equipment, or property. § 7372(c)(1). A private school receives the materials and equipment listed in § 7351(b)(2) by submitting to the LEA an application detailing which items the school seeks and how it will use them; the LEA, if it approves the application, purchases those items from the school’s allocation of funds, and then lends them to that school.</p>
<p id="b855-5">In Jefferson Parish (the Louisiana governmental unit at issue in this case), as in Louisiana as a whole, private schools have primarily used their allocations for nonrecurring expenses, usually materials and equipment. In the 1986-1987 fiscal year, for example, 44% of the money budgeted for private schools in Jefferson Parish was spent by LEA’s for acquiring library and media materials, and 48% for instructional equipment. Among the materials and equipment provided have been library books, computers, and computer software, and also slide and movie projectors, overhead projectors, television sets, tape recorders, VCR’s, projection screens, laboratory equipment, maps, globes, filmstrips, slides, and cassette recordings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b855-6">It appears that, in an average year, about 30% of Chapter 2 funds spent in Jefferson Parish are allocated for private schools. For the 1985-1986 fiscal year, 41 private schools participated in Chapter 2. For the following year, 46 participated, and the participation level has remained relatively constant since then. See App. 132a. Of these 46, 34 were Roman Catholic; 7 were otherwise religiously affiliated; and 5 were not religiously affiliated.</p>
<p id="b855-7">B</p>
<p id="b855-8">Respondents filed suit in December 1985, alleging, among other things, that Chapter 2, as applied in Jefferson Parish, <page-number citation-index="1" label="804">*804</page-number>violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The ease’s tortuous history-over the next 15 years indicates well the degree to which our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has shifted in recent times, while nevertheless retaining anomalies with which the lower courts have had to struggle.</p>
<p id="b856-5">In 1990, after extended discovery, Chief Judge Heebe of the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana granted summary judgment in favor of respondents. <em>Helms </em>v. <em>Cody, </em>Civ. A. No. 85-5533, <span class="citation no-link">1990 WL 36124</span> (Mar. 27), App. to Pet. for Cert. 137a. He held that Chapter 2 violated the Establishment Clause because, under the second part of our three-part test in <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108380"><a href="/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/#612" aria-description="Citation for case: Lemon v. Kurtzman">403 U. S. 602, 612-613</a></span> (1971), the program had the primary effect of advancing religion. Chapter 2 had sueh effect, in his view, because the materials and equipment loaned to the Catholic schools were direct aid to those schools and because the Catholic schools were, he concluded after detailed inquiry into their doctrine and curriculum, “pervasively sectarian.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 151a. Chief Judge Heebe relied primarily on <em>Meek </em>v. <em>Pittenger, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">421 U. S. 349</a></span> (1975), and <em>Wolman </em>v. <em>Walter, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v. Walter">433 U. S. 229</a></span> (1977), in which we held unconstitutional programs that provided many of the same sorts of materials and equipment as does Chapter 2. In 1994, after having resolved the numerous other issues in the ease, he issued an order permanently excluding pervasively sectarian schools in Jefferson Parish from receiving any Chapter 2 materials or equipment.</p>
<p id="b856-6">Two years later, Chief Judge Heebe having retired, Judge Livaudais received the ease. Ruling in early 1997 on post-judgment motions, he reversed the decision of former Chief Judge Heebe and upheld Chapter 2, pointing to several significant changes in the legal landscape over the previous seven years. <em>Helms </em>v. <em>Cody, </em><span class="citation no-link">1997 WL 35283</span> (Jan. 28), App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a. In particular, Judge Livaudais cited our 1993 decision in <em>Zobrest </em>v. <em>Catalina Foothills School Dish, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112887"><a href="/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-district/" aria-description="Citation for case: Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District">509 U. S. 1</a></span>, in which we held that a State could, as part <page-number citation-index="1" label="805">*805</page-number>of a federal program for the disabled, provide a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at a Catholic high school.</p>
<p id="b857-4">Judge Livaudais also relied heavily on a 1995 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, <em>Walker </em>v. <em>San Francisco Unified School Dist., </em><span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/F.%203d/46/1449/">46 F. 3d 1449</a></span>, upholding Chapter 2 on facts that he found “virtually indistinguishable.” The Ninth Circuit acknowledged in <em>Walker, </em>as Judge Heebe had in his 1990 summary judgment ruling, that <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v. Walter">Wolman</a></span> </em>appeared to erect a constitutional distinction between providing textbooks (permissible) and providing any other in-kind aid (impermissible). 46 F. 3d, at 1464-1465; see <em>Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 </em>v. <em>Allen, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107737"><a href="/opinion/107737/board-of-ed-of-central-school-dist-no-1-v-allen/" aria-description="Citation for case: Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen">392 U. S. 236</a></span> (1968) (upholding textbook program). The Court of Appeals viewed this distinction, however, as “thin” and “unmoored from any Establishment Clause principles,” and, more importantly, as “rendered untenable” by subsequent cases, particularly <em>Zobrest. </em>46 F. 3d, at 1465-1466. These cases, in the Ninth Circuit’s view, revived the principle of <em><span class="citation" data-id="107737"><a href="/opinion/107737/board-of-ed-of-central-school-dist-no-1-v-allen/" aria-description="Citation for case: Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen">Allen</a></span> </em>and of <em>Everson </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. of </em>Ewing;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that “state benefits provided to all citizens without regard to religion are constitutional.” 46 F. 3d, at 1465. The Ninth Circuit also relied, <em>id., </em>at 1467, on our observation in <em>Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. </em>v. <em>Grumet, </em><span class="citation" data-id="117870"><a href="/opinion/117870/board-of-ed-of-kiryas-joel-village-school-dist-v-grumet/" aria-description="Citation for case: Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet">512 U. S. 687</a></span> (1994), that “we have frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of any benefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges,” <span class="citation" data-id="117870"><a href="/opinion/117870/board-of-ed-of-kiryas-joel-village-school-dist-v-grumet/#704" aria-description="Citation for case: Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet"><em>id., </em>at 704</a></span>. The Ninth Circuit purported to distinguish <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v. Walter">Wolman</a></span> </em>based on the percentage of schools receiving aid that were parochial (a large percentage in those cases and a moderate percentage in <em>Walker), </em>46 F. 3d, at 1468, but that court undermined this distinction when it observed that <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span> </em>also upheld “the massive provision of text<page-number citation-index="1" label="806">*806</page-number>books to parochial schools.” 46 F. 3d, at 1468, n. 16. Thus, although the Ninth Circuit did not explicitly hold that <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v. Walter">Wolman</a></span> </em>were no longer good law, its reasoning seemed to require that conclusion.</p>
<p id="b858-5">Finally, in addition to relying on our decision in <em><span class="citation" data-id="112887"><a href="/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-district/" aria-description="Citation for case: Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District">Zobrest</a></span> </em>and the Ninth Circuit’s decision in <em>Walker, </em>Judge Livaudais invoked <em>Rosenberger </em>v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., </em><span class="citation no-link">615 U. S. 819</span> (1995), in which, a few months after <em>Walker, </em>we held that the Establishment Clause does not require a public university to exclude a student-run religious publication from assistance available to numerous other student-run publications.</p>
<p id="b858-6">Following Judge Livaudais’ ruling, respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. While that appeal was pending, we decided <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span>, </em>in which we approved a program that, under Title I of the ESEA, provided public employees to teach remedial classes at private schools, including religious schools. In so holding, we overruled <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Felton, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">473 U. S. 402</a></span> (1985), and partially overruled <em>School Dish of Grand Rapids </em>v. <em>Ball, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball">473 U. S. 373</a></span> (1985), both of which had involved such a program.</p>
<p id="b858-7">The Fifth Circuit thus faced a dilemma between, on the one hand, the Ninth Circuit’s holding and analysis in <em>Walker </em>and our subsequent decisions in <em><span class="citation no-link">Rosenberger</span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span>, </em>and, on the other hand, our holdings in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v. Walter">Wolman</a></span>. </em>To resolve the dilemma, the Fifth Circuit abandoned any effort to find coherence in our ease law or to divine the future course of our decisions and instead focused on our particular holdings. <em>Helms </em>v. <em>Picard, </em><span class="citation" data-id="15654"><a href="/opinion/15654/helms-v-picard/#371" aria-description="Citation for case: Helms v. Picard">151 F. 3d 347, 371</a></span> (1998). It thought such an approach required not only by the lack of coherence but also by <em>Agostini’s </em>admonition to lower courts to abide by any applicable holding of this Court even though that holding might seem inconsistent with our subsequent decisions, see <em>Agostini, </em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#237" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">521 U. S., at 237</a></span>. The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span>, </em>by recognizing our rejection of the rule that “all government aid that directly assists the <page-number citation-index="1" label="807">*807</page-number>educational function of religious schools is invalid,” <span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#225" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton"><em>id., </em>at 225</a></span>, had rejected a premise of <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span>, </em>hut that court nevertheless concluded that <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span> </em>had neither directly overruled <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v. Walter">Wolman</a></span> </em>nor rejected their distinction between textbooks and other in-kind aid. The Fifth Circuit therefore concluded that <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v. Walter">Wolman</a></span> </em>controlled, and thus it held Chapter 2 unconstitutional. We granted certiorari. <span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./527/1002/">527 U. S. 1002</a></span> (1999).</p>
<p id="b859-5">II</p>
<p id="b859-6">The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment dictates that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” In the over 50 years since <em>Everson </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104373"><a href="/opinion/104373/everson-v-board-of-ed-of-ewing/" aria-description="Citation for case: Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing">330 U. S. 1</a></span> (1947), we have consistently struggled to apply these simple words in the context of governmental aid to religious schools.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>As </em>we admitted in <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108381"><a href="/opinion/108381/tilton-v-richardson/" aria-description="Citation for case: Tilton v.

<p id="b859-7">In <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span>, </em>however, we brought some clarity to our ease law, by overruling two anomalous precedents (one in whole, the other in part) and by consolidating some of our previously disparate considerations under a revised test. Whereas in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108380"><a href="/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lemon v. Kurtzman">Lemon</a></span> </em>we had considered whether a statute (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or (3) creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion, see 403 U. S., at 612-613, in <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span> </em>we modified <em><span class="citation" data-id="108380"><a href="/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lemon v.

Felton">521 U. S., at 222-223</a></span>. We acknowledged <page-number citation-index="1" label="808">*808</page-number>that our cases discussing excessive entanglement had applied many of the same considerations as had our cases discussing primary effect, and we therefore recast <em>Lemon’s </em>entanglement inquiry as simply one criterion relevant to determining a statute’s effect. <span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#232" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton"><em>Agostini, supra, </em>at 232-233</a></span>. We also acknowledged that our eases had pared somewhat the factors that could justify a finding of excessive entanglement. <span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#238" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">521 U. S., at 238-284</a></span>. We then set out revised criteria for determining the effect of a statute:</p>
<blockquote id="b860-5">“To summarize, New York City’s Title I program does not run afoul of any of three primary criteria we currently use to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: It does not result in governmental indoctrination; define its recipients by reference to religion; or create an excessive entanglement.” <span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#234" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton"><em>Id., </em>at 234</a></span>.</blockquote>
<p id="b860-6">In this case, our inquiry under <em>Agostini’s </em>purpose and effect test is a narrow one. Because respondents do not challenge the District Court’s holding that Chapter 2 has a secular purpose, and because the Fifth Circuit also did not question that holding, ef. <span class="citation" data-id="15654"><a href="/opinion/15654/helms-v-picard/#369" aria-description="Citation for case: Helms v. Picard">151 F. 3d, at 369, n. 17</a></span>, we will consider only Chapter 2’s effect. Further, in determining that effect, we will consider only the first two <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span> </em>criteria, since neither respondents nor the Fifth Circuit has questioned the District Court’s holding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a, that Chapter 2 does not create an excessive entanglement. Considering Chapter 2 in light of our more recent ease law, we conclude that it neither results in religious indoctrination by the government nor defines its recipients by reference to religion. We therefore hold that Chapter 2 is not a “law respecting an establishment of religion.” In so holding, we acknowledge what both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits saw was <em>inescapable </em>— Meek and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v.

<p id="b861-5">As we indicated in <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v.

See <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span>, </em>521U.

<p id="b861-6">In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, we have consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion. If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government. For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question. If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any par<page-number citation-index="1" label="810">*810</page-number>ticular indoctrination. To put the point differently, if the government, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without regard to religion, to all who adequately further that purpose, see <em>Allen, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107737"><a href="/opinion/107737/board-of-ed-of-central-school-dist-no-1-v-allen/#245" aria-description="Citation for case: Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen">392 U. S., at 245-247</a></span> (discussing dual secular and religious purposes of religious schools), then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose. The government, in crafting such an aid program, has had to conclude that a given level of aid is necessary to further that purpose among secular recipients and has provided no more than that same level to religious recipients.</p>
<p id="b862-5">As a way of assuring neutrality, we have repeatedly considered whether any governmental aid that goes to a religious institution does so “only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of individuals.” <span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#226" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton"><em>Agostini, supra, </em>at 226</a></span> (internal quotation marks omitted). We have viewed as significant whether the “private choices of individual parents,” as opposed to the “unmediated” will of government, <em>Ball, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/#395" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball">473 U. S., at 395, n. 13</a></span> (internal quotation marks omitted), determine what schools ultimately benefit from the governmental aid, and how much. For if numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment. Private choice also helps guarantee neutrality by mitigating the preference for pre-existing recipients that is arguably inherent in any governmental aid program, see, <em>e. g., </em>Gilder, The Revitalization of Everything: The Law of the Macrocosm, Harv. Bus. Rev. 49 (Mar./Apr. 1988), and that could lead to a program inadvertently favoring one religion or favoring religious private schools in general over nonreligious ones.</p>

By according parents freedom to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents.

<p id="b865-6"><em>Agostini's </em>second primary criterion for determining the effect of governmental aid is closely related to the first.

<p id="b866-5">We hasten to add, what should be obvious from the rule itself, that simply because an aid program offers private schools, and thus religious schools, a benefit that they did not previously receive does not mean that the program, by reducing the cost of securing a religious education, creates, under <em>Agostini’s </em>second criterion, an “incentive” for parents to choose such an education for their children.

<p id="b870-5">Further, respondents’ formalistic line breaks down in the application to real-world programs.

<p id="b872-6">Respondents also contend that the Establishment Clause requires that aid to religious schools not be impermissibly religious in nature or be divertible to religious use. We agree with the first part of this argument but not the second. Respondents’ “no divertibility” rule is inconsistent with our more recent case law and is unworkable. So long as the governmental aid is not itself “unsuitable for use in the public schools because of religious content,” <em>Allen, supra, </em>at 245, and eligibility for aid is determined in a constitutionally permissible manner, any use of that aid to indoctrinate cannot be attributed to the government and is thus not of constitutional concern. And, of course, the use to which the aid is put does not affect the criteria governing the aid’s allocation and thus does not create any impermissible incentive under <em>Agostini’s </em>second criterion.</p>

Although it might appear that a book, because it has a pre-existing content, is not divertible, and thus that lack of divertibility motivated our holding in <em>Allen, </em>it is hard to imagine any book that could not, in even moderately skilled hands, serve to illustrate a religious message.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Post, </em>at 855 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) <page-number citation-index="1" label="824">*824</page-number>(agreeing with this point). Indeed, the plaintiffs in <em>Walker </em>essentially conceded as much. 46 F. 3d, at 1469, n. 17. A teacher could, for example, easily use Shakespeare's King Lear, even though set in pagan times, to illustrate the Fourth Commandment. See Exodus 20:12 (“Honor your father and your mother”). Thus, it is a non sequitur for the dissent to contend that the textbooks in <em>Allen </em>were “not readily divertible to religious teaching purposes” because they “had a known and fixed secular content.” <em>Post, </em>at 893-894.</p>
<p id="b876-5">A concern for divertibility, as opposed to improper content, is misplaced not only because it fails to explain why the sort of aid that we have allowed is permissible, but also because it is boundless — enveloping all aid, no matter how trivial — and thus has only the most attenuated (if any) link to any realistic concern for preventing an “establishment of religion.” Presumably, for example, government-provided lecterns, chalk, crayons, pens, paper, and paintbrushes would have to be excluded from religious schools under respondents’ proposed rule. But we fail to see how indoctrination by means of <em>(i. e., </em>diversion of) such aid could be attributed to the government. In fact, the risk of improper attribution is <em>less </em>when the aid <em>lacks </em>content, for there is no risk (as there is with books) of the government inadvertently providing improper content. See <em>Allen, supra, </em>at 255-262 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Finally, <em>any </em>aid, with or without content, is “divertible” in the sense that it allows schools to “divert” resources. Yet we have “ ‘not accepted the recurrent argument that all aid is forbidden because aid to one aspect of an institution frees it to spend its other resources on religious ends.’ ” <em>Regan, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110189"><a href="/opinion/110189/committee-for-public-education-religious-liberty-v-regan/" aria-description="Citation for case: Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v.

<p id="AeCW"><page-number citation-index="1" label="825">*825</page-number>It is perhaps conceivable that courts could take upon themselves the task of distinguishing among the myriad kinds of possible aid based on the ease of diverting each kind. But it escapes us how a court might coherently draw any such line. It not only is far more workable, but also is actually related to real concerns about preventing advancement of religion by government, simply to require, as did <em>Zobrest, Agostini, </em>and <em>Allen, </em>that a program of aid to schools not provide improper content and that it determine eligibility and allocate the aid on a permissible basis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>

<p id="b877-6">The dissent serves up a smorgasbord of 11 factors that, depending on the facts of each case “in all its particularity,” <em>post, </em>at 877, could be relevant to the constitutionality of a school-aid program. And those 11 are a bare minimum. We are reassured that there are likely more.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>post, </em>at 885, 888. Presumably they will be revealed in future eases, as needed, but at least one additional factor is evident from the dissent itself: The dissent resurrects the concern for political divisiveness that once occupied the Court but that <em>post-Aguilar </em>cases have rightly disregarded. Compare <em>post, </em>at 868, 872, 901, 902, 909, n. 27, with <em>Agostini, </em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#233" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v.

S., at 429. While the dissent delights in the perverse chaos that all these factors produce, <em>post, </em>at 899; see also <em>post, </em>at 869, 885, the Constitution becomes unnecessarily clouded, and legislators, litigants, and lower courts groan, as the history of this case amply demonstrates. See Part I-B, <em>supra.</em></p>
<p id="b878-5">One of the dissent’s factors deserves special mention: whether a school that receives aid (or whose students receive aid) is pervasively sectarian. The dissent is correct that there was a period when this factor mattered, particularly if the pervasively sectarian school was a primary or secondary school. <em>Post, </em>at 885-887, 894, 898, 902-906. But that period is one that the Court should regret, and it is thankfully long past.</p>
<p id="b878-6">There are numerous reasons to formally dispense with this factor. First, its relevance in our precedents is in sharp decline.

<p id="b879-5">Second, the religious nature of a recipient should not matter to the constitutional analysis, so long as the recipient adequately furthers the government’s secular purpose. See <em>supra, </em>at 810. If a program offers permissible aid to the religious (including the pervasively sectarian), the areligious, and the irreligious, it is a mystery which view of religion the government has established, and thus a mystery what the constitutional violation would be. The pervasively sectarian recipient has not received any special favor, and it is most bizarre that the Court would, as the dissent seemingly does, reserve special hostility for those who take their religion seriously, who think that their religion should affect the whole <page-number citation-index="1" label="828">*828</page-number>of their lives, or who make the mistake of being effective in transmitting their views to children.</p>
<p id="b880-5">Third, the inquiry into the recipient’s religious views required by a focus on whether a school is pervasively sectarian is not only unnecessary but also offensive. It is well established, in numerous other contexts, that courts should refrain from trolling through a person’s or institution’s religious beliefs. See <em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112404"><a href="/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/#887" aria-description="Citation for case: Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith">494 U. S. 872, 887</a></span> (1990) (collecting cases). Yet that is just what this factor requires, as was evident before the District Court. Although the dissent welcomes such probing, see <em>post, </em>at 904-906, we find it profoundly troubling. In addition, and related, the application of the “pervasively sectarian” factor collides with our decisions that have prohibited governments from discriminating in the distribution of public benefits based upon religious status or sincerity. See <em>Rosenberger </em>v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., </em><span class="citation" data-id="117967"><a href="/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-visitors-of-university-of-virginia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of University of Virginia">515 U. S. 819</a></span> (1995); <em>Lamb's Chapel </em>v. <em>Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., </em><span class="citation" data-id="112874"><a href="/opinion/112874/lambs-chapel-v-center-moriches-union-free-school-district/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lamb&#x27;s Chapel v.

Vincent">454 U. S. 263</a></span> (1981).</p>
<p id="b880-6">Finally, hostility to aid to pervasively sectarian schools has a shameful pedigree that we do not hesitate to disavow. Cf. <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>Morales, </em><span class="citation" data-id="118299"><a href="/opinion/118299/city-of-chicago-v-morales/#53" aria-description="Citation for case: City of Chicago v. Morales">527 U. S. 41,53-54, n. 20</a></span> (1999) (plurality opinion). Although the dissent professes concern for “the implied exclusion of the less favored,” <em>post, </em>at 868, the exclusion of pervasively sectarian schools from government-aid programs is just that, particularly given the history of such exclusion. Opposition to aid to “sectarian” schools acquired prominence in the 1870’s with Congress’ consideration (and near passage) of the Blaine Amendment, which would have amended the Constitution to bar any aid to sectarian institutions. Consideration of the amendment arose at a time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general, and it was an open secret that “sectarian” was code for “Catholic.” See generally Green, The Blaine Amendment Reconsidered, <span class="citation no-link">36 Am. J. Legal Hist. 38</span> (1992). <page-number citation-index="1" label="829">*829</page-number>Notwithstanding its history, of course, “sectarian” could, on its face, describe the school of any religious sect, but the Court eliminated this possibility of confusion when, in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108862"><a href="/opinion/108862/hunt-v-mcnair/" aria-description="Citation for case: Hunt v. McNair">Hunt</a></span> </em>v. <em>McNair, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108862"><a href="/opinion/108862/hunt-v-mcnair/#743" aria-description="Citation for case: Hunt v. McNair">413 U. S., at 743</a></span>, it coined the term “pervasively sectarian” — a term which, at that time, could be applied almost exclusively to Catholic parochial schools and which even today’s dissent exemplifies chiefly by reference to such schools. See <em>post, </em>at 886, 904-906 (opinion of Soutek, J.).</p>
<p id="b881-7">In short, nothing in the Establishment Clause requires the exclusion of pervasively sectarian schools from otherwise permissible aid programs, and other doctrines of this Court bar it. This doctrine, born of bigotry, should be buried now.</p>
<p id="b881-8">J-H W-&lt;</p>
<p id="b881-3">Applying the two relevant <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span> </em>criteria, we see no basis for concluding that Jefferson Parish’s Chapter 2 program “has the effect of advancing religion.” <span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#234" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton"><em>Agostini, supra, </em>at 234</a></span>. Chapter 2 does not result in governmental indoctrination, because it determines eligibility for aid neutrally, allocates that aid based on the private choices of the parents of schoolchildren, and does not provide aid that has an impermissible content. Nor does Chapter 2 define its recipients by reference to religion.</p>
<p id="b881-4">Taking the second criterion first, it is clear that Chapter 2 aid “is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.” <em>Agostini, </em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#231" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">521 U. S., at 231</a></span>. Aid is allocated based on enrollment: “Private schools receive Chapter 2 materials and equipment based on the per capita number of students at each school,” <em>Walker, </em>46 F. 3d, at 1464, and allocations to private schools must “be equal (consistent with the number of children to be served) to expenditures for programs under this subchapter for children enrolled in the public schools of the [LEA],” <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 7372</span>(b). LEA’s must provide Chapter 2 materials and equipment for the benefit <page-number citation-index="1" label="830">*830</page-number>of children in private schools “[t]o the extent consistent with the number of children in the school district of [an LEA]... who are enrolled in private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools.” § 7372(a)(1). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 87a (District Court, recounting testimony of head of Louisiana’s Chapter 2 program that LEA’s are told that “‘for every dollar you spend for the public school student, you spend the same dollar for the non-public school student’ ”); §§ 7372(a)(1) and (b) (children in private schools must receive “equitable participation”). The allocation criteria therefore create no improper incentive. Chapter 2 does, by statute, deviate from a pure per capita basis for allocating aid to LEA’s, increasing the per-pupil allocation based on the number of children within an LEA who are from poor families, reside in poor areas, or reside in rural areas. §§ 7312(a)-(b). But respondents have not contended, nor do we have any reason to think, that this deviation in the allocation <em>to </em>the LEA’s leads to deviation in the allocation among schools <em>within </em>each LEA, see §§ 7372(a)-(b), and, even if it did, we would not presume that such <em>a </em>deviation created any incentive one way or the other with regard to religion.</p>
<p id="b882-5">Chapter 2 also satisfies the first <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span> </em>criterion. The program makes a broad array of schools eligible for aid without regard to their religious affiliations or lack thereof. § 7372; see § 7353(a)(3). We therefore have no difficulty concluding that Ghapter 2 is neutral with regard to religion. See <span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#225" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton"><em>Agostini, supra, </em>at 225-226</a></span>.

Private decisionmaking controls because of the per capita allocation scheme, and those decisions are independent because of the program’s neutrality.

It is the students and their parents— not the government — who, through their choice of school, determine who receives Chapter 2 funds. The aid follows the child.</p>
<p id="b883-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="831">*831</page-number>Because Chapter 2 aid is provided pursuant to private choices, it is not problematic that one could fairly describe Chapter 2 as providing “direct” aid. The materials and equipment provided under Chapter 2 are presumably used from time to time by entire classes rather than by individual students (although individual students are likely the chief consumers of library books and, perhaps, of computers and computer software), and students themselves do not need to apply for Chapter 2 aid in order for their schools to receive it, but, as we explained in <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span>, </em>these traits are not constitutionally significant or meaningful. See <span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/#228" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton"><em>id., </em>at 228-229</a></span>. Nor, for reasons we have already explained, is it of constitutional significance that the schools themselves, rather than the students, are the bailees of the Chapter 2 aid. The ultimate beneficiaries of Chapter 2 aid are the students who attend the schools that receive that aid, and this is so regardless of whether individual students lug computers to school each day or, as Jefferson Parish has more sensibly provided, the schools receive the computers. Like the Ninth Circuit, and unlike the dissent, <em>post, </em>at 888, we “see little difference in loaning science kits to students who then bring the kits to school as opposed to loaning science kits to the school directly.” <em>Walker, supra, </em>at 1468, n. 16; see <em>Allen, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107737"><a href="/opinion/107737/board-of-ed-of-central-school-dist-no-1-v-allen/#244" aria-description="Citation for case: Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen">392 U. S., at 244, n. 6</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b883-5">Finally, Chapter 2 satisfies the first <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v. Felton">Agostini</a></span> </em>criterion because it does not provide to religious schools aid that has an impermissible content. The statute explicitly bars anything of the sort, providing that all Chapter 2 aid for the benefit of children in private schools shall be “secular, neutral, and nonideological,” § 7372(a)(1), and the record indicates that the Louisiana SEA and the Jefferson Parish LEA have faithfully enforced this requirement insofar as relevant to this case. The chief aid at issue is computers, computer software, and library books. The computers presumably have no preexisting content, or at least none that would be impermissible for use in public schools. Respondents do not contend <page-number citation-index="1" label="832">*832</page-number>otherwise. Respondents also offer no evidence that religious schools have received software from the government that has an impermissible content.</p>
<p id="b884-5">There is evidence that equipment has been, or at least easily could be, diverted for use in religious classes. See, <em>e. g., </em>App. 108a, 118a, 205a-207a. Justice O’Connor, however, finds the safeguards against diversion adequate to prevent and detect actual diversion. <em>Post, </em>at 861, 867 (opinion concurring in judgment). The safeguards on which she relies reduce to three: (1) signed assurances that Chapter 2 aid will be used only for secular, neutral, and nonideological purposes, (2) monitoring visits, and (3) the requirement that equipment be labeled as belonging to Chapter 2.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As to the first, Justice O’Connor rightly places little reliance on it. <em>Post, </em>at 862. As to the second, monitoring by SEA and LEA officials is highly unlikely to prevent or catch diversion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As to the third, compliance with the labeling re<page-number citation-index="1" label="833">*833</page-number>quirement is haphazard, see App. 113a, and, even if the requirement were followed, we fail to see how a label prevents diversion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, we agree with the dissent that there is evidence of actual diversion and that, were the safeguards anything other than anemic, there would almost certainly be more such evidence. See <em>post, </em>at 903, 906-910.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In any event, for reasons we discussed in Part II-B-2, <page-number citation-index="1" label="834">*834</page-number><em>supra, </em>the evidence of actual diversion and the weakness of the safeguards against actual diversion are not relevant to the constitutional inquiry, whatever relevance they may have under the statute and regulations.</p>
<p id="b886-5">[Respondents do, however, point to some religious books that the LEA improperly allowed to be loaned to several religious schools, and they contend that the monitoring programs of the SEA and the Jefferson Parish LEA are insufficient to prevent such errors. The evidence, however, establishes just the opposite, for the improper lending of library books occurred — and was discovered and remedied — -before this litigation began almost 15 years ago.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In other words, the monitoring system worked. See <em>post, </em>at 866 (O’Con-nor, J., concurring in judgment). Further, the violation by the LEA and the private schools was minor and, in the view of the SEA’s coordinator, inadvertent. See App. 122a. There were approximately 191 improper book requests over three years (the 1982-1988 through 1984-1985 school years); these requests came from fewer than half of the 40 private schools then participating; and the cost of the 191 books <page-number citation-index="1" label="835">*835</page-number>amounted to “less than one percent of the total allocation over all those years.” <em>Id., </em>at 132a-133a.</p>
<p id="b887-5">The District Court found that prescreening by the LEA coordinator of requested library books was sufficient to prevent statutory violations, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a, and the Fifth Circuit did not disagree. Further, as noted, the monitoring system appears adequate to catch those errors that do occur. We are unwilling to elevate scattered <em>de minimis </em>statutory violations, discovered and remedied by the relevant authorities themselves prior to any litigation, to such a level as to convert an otherwise unobjectionable parishwide program into a law that has the effect of advancing religion.</p>
<p id="b887-6">IV</p>
<p id="b887-7">In short, Chapter 2 satisfies both the first and second primary criteria of <em><span class="citation" data-id="118133"><a href="/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Agostini v.

We presume that whether a parish has complied with that statutory requirement would be, at the very least, relevant to whether a violation of any constitutional supplement/supplant requirement has occurred, yet we have no reason to believe that there has been any material statutory violation. A statewide review by the Louisiana SEA indicated that § 7371(b) receives nearly universal compliance. App. 112a.
