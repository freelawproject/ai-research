 We agree that Heisler’s reasoning has been undermined by more recent cases. The Heisler analysis evolved at a time when the Commerce Clause was thought to prohibit the States from imposing any direct taxes on interstate commerce.  *615 See, e. g., Helson & Randolph v. Kentucky, 279 U. S. 245, 250-252 (1929); Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v. Monier, 266 U. S. 555, 562 (1925).  Consequently, the distinction between intrastate activities and interstate commerce was crucial to protecting the States’ taxing power.  4 The Court has, however, long since rejected any suggestion that a state tax or regulation affecting interstate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches only to a “local” or intrastate activity.  See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333, 350 (1977); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 141-142 (1970); Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S. 416, 423-424 (1946).  Correspondingly, the Court has rejected the notion that state taxes levied on interstate commerce are per se invalid.  See, e. g., Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., <citedDecision>435 U. S. 734</citedDecision> (1978); Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra. In reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes, our goal has instead been to “establish a consistent and rational method of inquiry” focusing on “the practical effect of a challenged tax.” Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S. 425, 443 (1980).  See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 276-281 (1978); Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedor *616 ing Cos., supra, at 743-751; Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra, at 277-279 .  We conclude that the same “practical” analysis should apply in reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state severance taxes.  In the first place, there is no real distinction — in terms of economic effects — between severance taxes and other types of state taxes that have been subjected to Commerce Clause scrutiny.  5 See, e. g., Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157 (1954); Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., 330 U. S. 422 (1947), Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n, 302 U. S. 90 (1937), both overruled in Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., supra. 6 State taxes levied on a “local” activity preceding entry of the goods into interstate commerce may substantially affect interstate commerce, and this effect is the proper focus of Commerce Clause inquiry.  See Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, supra, at 443.  Second, this Court has acknowledged that “a State has a significant interest in exacting from interstate commerce its fair share of the cost of state government,” Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., supra, at 748.

 See St. Louis & S. W. R. Co. v. Nattin, 277 U. S. 157, 159 (1928); Thomas v. Gay, 169 U. S. 264, 280 (1898).  There is no reason to suppose that this latitude afforded the States under the Due Process Clause is somehow divested by the Commerce Clause merely because the taxed activity has some connection to interstate commerce; particularly when the tax is levied on an activity conducted within the State.  “The exploitation by foreign corporations [or consumers] of intrastate opportunities under the protection and encouragement of local government offers a basis for taxation as unrestricted as that for domestic corporations.” Ford Motor Co. v. Beauchamp, 308 U. S. 331, 334-335 (1939); see also Ott v. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., 336 U. S. 169 (1949).  To accept appellants’ apparent suggestion that the Commerce Clause prohibits the States from requiring an activity connected to interstate commerce to contribute to the general cost of providing governmental services, as distinct from those costs attributable to the taxed activity, would place such commerce in a privileged position.  But as we recently reiterated, “‘[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it in *624 creases the cost of doing business.’ ” Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U. S. 100, 108 (1975), quoting Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S., at 254 .  The “just share of state tax burden” includes sharing in the cost of providing “police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and The advantages of a civilized society.’.” Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980), quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 445 (1979).  See Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., <citedDecision>435 U. S., at 750-751</citedDecision> ; <citedDecision>id., at 764</citedDecision> (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in result); General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436, 440-441 (1964).  Furthermore, there can be no question that Montana may constitutionally raise general revenue by imposing a 'severance tax on coal mined in the State.  The entire value of the coal, before transportation, originates in the State, and mining of the coal depletes the resource base and wealth of the State, thereby diminishing a future source of taxes and economic activity.  13 Cf. Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 758-759 .  In many respects, a severance tax is like a real property tax, which has never been doubted as a legitimate means of raising revenue by the situs State (quite apart from the right of that or any other State to tax income derived from use of the property).  See, e. g., Old Dominion S.S. Co. v. Virginia, 198 U. S. 299 (1905); Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Missouri ex rel. Gottlieb, 190 U. S. 412 (1903); Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, 155 U. S. 688 (1895).  When, as here, a general revenue tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce and is apportioned to activities occurring within *625 the State, the State “is free to pursue its own fiscal policies, unembarrassed by the Constitution, if by the practical operation of a tax the state has exerted its power in relation to opportunities which it has given, to protection which it has afforded, to benefits which it has conferred by the fact of being an orderly, civilized society.” Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435, 444 (1940).

 See U. S. Dept, of Agrie., State Taxation of Mineral Deposits and Production (1977).  By 1979, 33 States had adopted some type of severance tax. See TJ. S. Bureau of Census, State Government Tax Collections in 1979, Table 3, p. 6 (1980).  The fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test is derived from General Motors, J. C. Penney, and similar cases. See 430 U. S., at 279, n. 8; see also National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551, 558 (1977).  Indeed, the words “amount” and “value” were not even used in Complete Auto Transit.  See 430 U. S., at 279.  Similarly, our cases applying the Complete Auto Transit test have not mentioned either of these words.  See Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S. 425, 443 (1980); Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. *626 434, 444-445 (1979); Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., <citedDecision>435 U. S. 734, 750</citedDecision> (1978); National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization, supra, at 558.  In any event, the linchpin of appellants’ contention is the incorrect assumption that the amount of state taxes that may be levied on an activity connected to interstate commerce .is limited by the costs incurred by the State on account of that activity.  Only then does it make sense to advocate judicial examination of the relationship between taxes paid and benefits provided.  But as we have previously noted, see supra, at 623-624, interstate commerce may be required to contribute to the cost of providing all governmental services, including those services from which it arguably receives no direct "benefit.” In such circumstances, absent an equal protection challenge (which appellants do not raise), and unless a court is to second-guess legislative decisions about the amount or disposition of tax revenues, it is difficult to see how the court is to go about comparing costs and benefits in order to decide whether the tax burden on an activity connected to interstate commerce is excessive.  Of course, a taxing statute may be judicially disapproved if it is “so arbitrary as to compel the conclusion that it does not involve an exertion of the taxing power, but constitutes, in substance and effect, the direct exertion of a different and forbidden power, as, for example, the confiscation of property.” Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40, 44 (1934).  The controversy over the Montana tax has not escaped the attention of the Congress.  Several bills were introduced during the 96th Congress to limit the rate of state severance taxes.
