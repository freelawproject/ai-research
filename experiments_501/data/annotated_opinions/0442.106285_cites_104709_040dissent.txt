**Dissenting Opinion**
 .  they obviously contravene the Federal and State constitutional provisions; by being convicted under the Statute involved herein, and in the manner in which she was convicted, Defendant-Appellant has been denied due process of law; a sentence of from one (1) to seven (7) years in a penal institution for alleged violation of this unconstitutional section of the Ohio Revised Code deprives the defendant of her right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness, contrary to the Federal and State constitutional provisions, for circumstances which she herself did not put in motion, and is a cruel and unusual punishment inflicted upon her contrary to the State and Federal Constitutions.” The appellant’s brief did not urge the overruling of Wolf.  Indeed it did not even cite the ease.  The brief of the appellee merely relied on Wolf in support of the State’s contention that appellant’s conviction was not vitiated by the admission in evidence of the fruits of the alleged unlawful search and seizure by the police.  The brief of the American and Ohio Civil Liberties Unions, as amici, did in one short concluding paragraph of its argument “request” the Court to re-examine and overrule Wolf, but without argumentation.  I quote in full this part of their brief: “This case presents the issue of whether evidence obtained in an illegal search and seizure can constitutionally be used in a State criminal proceeding.  We are aware of the view that this Court has taken on this issue in Wolf v. Colorado, <citedDecision>338 U. S. 25</citedDecision> .  It is our purpose by this paragraph to respectfully request that this Court re-examine this issue and conclude that the ordered liberty concept guaranteed to persons by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment necessarily requires that evidence illegally obtained in violation thereof, not be admissible in state criminal proceedings.” Counsel for appellant on oral argument, as in his brief, did not urge that <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> be overruled.  Indeed, when pressed by questioning from the bench whether he was not in fact urging us to overrule <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> , counsel expressly disavowed any such purpose.  “2905.37 Legitimate PublicatioNS Not Obscene.  “Sections 2905.33 to 2905.36, inclusive, of the Revised Code do not affect teaching in regularly chartered medical colleges, the publication of standard medical books, or regular practitioners of medicine or druggists in their legitimate business, nor do they affect the publication and distribution of bona fide works of art. No articles specified in sections 2905.33, 2905.34, and 2905.36 of the Revised Code shall be considered a work of art unless such article is made, published, and distributed by a bona fide association of artists or an association for the advancement of art whose demonstrated purpose does not contravene sections 2905.06 to 2905.44, inclusive, of the Revised Code, and which is not organized for profit.” § 3767.01 (C) “This section and sections 2905.34, .  .  .  2905.37 ... of the Revised Code shall not affect .  .  .  any newspaper, magazine, or other publication entered as second class matter by the post-office department.” The Ohio Supreme Court, in its construction of § 2905.34, controlling upon us here, refused to import into it any other exceptions than those expressly provided by the statute.  See note 7, supra. Instead it held that “If anyone looks at a book and finds it lewd, he is forthwith, under this legislation, guilty .  .  .  .” See <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. Colorado, <citedDecision>338 U. S., at 39-40</citedDecision> ; Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 133-134 , and at 138-139.  In the latter case, decided in 1954, Mr. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority, said (at p. 134): “We think that the <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> decision should not be overruled, for the reasons so persuasively stated therein.” Compare Schwartz v. Texas, 344 U. S. 199 , and Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 , in which the <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> case was discussed and in no way disapproved.  And see Pugach v. Dollinger, 365 U. S. 458 , which relied on Schwartz .  Actually, only four members of the majority support this reasoning.  See pp. 685-686, infra.  Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 ; Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253 .  My Brother Stewart concurs in the Court’s judgment on grounds which have nothing to do with <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> .
