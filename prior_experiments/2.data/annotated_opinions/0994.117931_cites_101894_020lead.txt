“Shows” is a strong word; among its definitions is “[t]o make apparent or clear by evidence, testimony or reasoning; to prove; demonstrate.” Webster’s New International Dictionary 2324 (2d ed. 1949). Cf. Rowland v. California Men’s Colony, Unit II Men’s Advisory Council, 506 U.¥S. 194, 200-201 (1993) (discussing similar provision *701 requiring adherence to presumptive definition unless context “indicated] ” a different meaning). 4 In Rowland, we explained the proper method of analyzing a statutory term’s “context” to determine when a presumptive definition must yield. Such an analysis, we explained, requires a court to examine “the text of the Act of Congress surrounding the word at issue, or the texts of other related congressional Acts ....” <targetCase>Id.</targetCase>, at 199; see also id., at 212-213 (Thomas, J., dissenting); Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 689-690, n. 53 (1978). Review of other materials is not warranted. “If Congress had meant to point further afield, as to legislative history, for example, it would have been natural to use a more spacious phrase, like ‘evidence of congressional intent,’ in place of ‘context.’” Rowland, 506 U. S., at 200. In the case of § 1001, there is nothing in the text of the statute, or in any related legislation, that even suggests — let alone “shows” — that the normal definition of “department” was not intended. Accordingly, a straightforward interpretation of the text of §1001, with special emphasis on the words “department or agency,” would seem to lead inexorably to the conclusion that there is no need for any judicial function exception because the reach of the statute simply does not extend to courts. Our task, however, is complicated by the fact that the Court interpreted “department” broadly 40 years ago in Bramblett. We must, therefore, *702 turn our attention to that case before deciding the fate of the judicial function exception. Ill Defendant Bramblett was a former Member of Congress who had falsely represented to the Disbursing Office of the House of Representatives that a particular person was entitled to compensation as his official clerk. He argued that he could not be convicted under §1001 because his falsehood was directed to an office within the Legislative Branch. 348 U. S., at 504. The Court rejected this argument, concluding that the word “department,” as used in § 1001, “was meant to describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Government.” <targetCase>Id.</targetCase>, at 509. Although Bramblett involved Congress, not the courts, the text and reasoning in the Court’s opinion amalgamated all three branches of the Government. Thus, Bramblett is highly relevant here even though its narrow holding only extended § 1001 to false statements made within the Legislative Branch. We think Bramblett must be acknowledged as a seriously flawed decision. Significantly, the Bramblett Court made no attempt to reconcile its interpretation with the usual meaning of “department.” It relied instead on a review of the evolution of § 1001 and its statutory cousin, the false claims statute presently codified at 18 U. S. C. § 287, as providing a “context” for the conclusion that “Congress could not have intended to leave frauds such as [Bramblett’s] without penalty.” 348 U. S., at 509. We are convinced that the Court erred by giving insufficient weight to the plain language of §§6 and 1001. 5 Although the historical evolution of a stat *703 ute — based on decisions by the entire Congress — should not be discounted for the reasons that may undermine confidence in the significance of excerpts from congressional debates and committee reports, 6 a historical analysis normally provides less guidance to a statute’s meaning than its final text.

4,1909, 35 Stat. 1095. “ ‘Does a defendant “cover up ... a material fact” when he pleads not guilty?’ ‘Does an attorney “cover up” when he moves to exclude hearsay testimony he knows to be true, or when he makes a summation on behalf of a client he knows to be guilty?’ ” Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d 234, 237 (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963). Some 17 years before Masterpol, the Second Circuit restricted the application of § 1001 in a slightly different manner. In United States v. D'Amato, 507 F. 2d 26 (1974), the court overturned a § 1001 conviction arising out of a false affidavit submitted in the course of a private civil lawsuit. Based upon a review of relevant case law and legislative history, the court concluded that § 1001 did not apply “where the Government is involved only by way of a court deciding a matter in which the Government or its agencies are not involved.” <targetCase>Id.</targetCase>, at 28. Accord, United States v. London, 714 F. 2d 1558, 1561-1562 (CA11 1983). See also, e. g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S., at 172-173 (stare decisis has “special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done”); Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986) (noting “the strong presumption of continued validity that adheres in the judicial interpretation of a statute”); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 189 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring) (declining to overturn “a line of [statutory] authority which I firmly believe to have been incorrectly decided”); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 286 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting) (“Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true, even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation”) (citation omitted). Because the fate of the judicial function exception is tied so closely to Bramblett, we find no merit in the Government’s suggestion that a reconsideration of the validity of that decision is not fairly included in the question on which we granted certiorari. See generally Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379-383 (1995). The dissent criticizes us for according respect to a body of law developed in the lower courts, arguing that our decision will “induce” federal judges on the courts of appeals to “ignore” precedents from this Court and thereby invite chaos in the judicial system.
