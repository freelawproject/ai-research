**Dissenting Opinion**
 The majority also quotes the Shively Court’s statement that federal grants “ ‘leave the question of the use of the shores by the owners of uplands to the sovereign control of each State.’ ” Ante, at 379, quoting 152 U. S., at 58 .  It is clear from the context that by “shores” the Shively Court meant the land below the high-water mark.  The State, as owner of that land, controls, it.  The Court did not suggest that the State was free to diminish the title of the upland owner by denying his right to an ambulatory boundary if the “shores” recede or the uplands grow.  The majority’s assertion that the rule of New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 (1836), and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46 (1874), is merely a description of the English common law, ante, at 380-381, n. 8, is belied by the Shively Court’s affirmation of the independence of the riparian holder’s rights from the law governing the lands beneath the water.  The majority chooses not to discuss this aspect of Shivély.  Joy v. St. Louis, <citedDecision>201 U. S. 332, 342, 343</citedDecision> (1906), cited ante, at 377, 380, does contain language which supports the conclusions reached by the majority.  That case, however, did not involve lands in which a grantee of the United States held or claimed title.  The land in that case was granted by Spain.  Congress confirmed the grant, but by so doing it added nothing to the title conferred by Spain.  See Joy v. St. Louis, 122 P. 524 (ED Mo. 1903), aff’d, <citedDecision>201 U. S. 332</citedDecision> (1906); United States v. Washington, 294 F. 2d 830, 833 (CA9 1961), cert. denied, 369 U. S. 817 (1962).  When, the papers before the Court indicate that a choice-of-law question will be presented, the Solicitor General sometimes prepares an amicus brief on his own motion.  See, e. g., Memorandum for United States as Amicus Curiae and Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Free v. Bland, O. T. 1961, No. 205.  In the present case, of course, the Solicitor General had no notice from the petitions for certiorari that the issue decided today would be raised.  See n. 2, supra.
