**Concurrence Opinion**
 Where those rights are derived from national citizenship no state may impose such a test, and whether the Congress could do so we are not called upon to inquire.  I think California had no right to make the condition of Duncan’s purse, with no evidence of violation by him of any law or social policy which caused it, the basis of excluding him or of punishing one who extended him aid.  If I doubted whether his federal citizenship alone were enough to open the gates of California to Duncan, my doubt would disappear on consideration of the obligations of such citizenship.  Duncan owes a duty to render military service, and this Court has said that this duty is the result of his citizenship.  Mr. Chief Justice White declared in the Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U. S. 366 , 378: “It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel it.”{'A contention that a citizen’s duty to render military service is suspended by “indigence” would meet with little favor.  Rich or penniless, Duncan’s citizenship under the Con *186 stitution pledges his strength to the defense of California as a part of the United States, and his right to migrate to any part of the land he must defend is something she must respect under the same instrument.  Unless this Court is willing to say that citizenship of the United States means at least this much to the citizen, then our heritage of constitutional privileges and immunities is only a promise to the ear to be broken to the hope, a teasing illusion like a munificent bequest in a pauper’s will.
