 Because the unsuccessful plaintiffs in that earlier case were pharmacists, the court said, "theirs was a prima facie commercial approach," 373 F. Supp., at 686 .  The present plaintiffs, on the other hand, were asserting an interest in their own health that was "fundamentally deeper than a trade consideration." Ibid. In the District Court's view, the expression in Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52, 54-55 (1942), to the effect that "purely commercial advertising" is not protected had been tempered, by later decisions of this Court, to the point that First Amendment interests in the free flow of price information could be found to outweigh the countervailing interests of the State.  The strength of the interest in the free flow of drug price information was borne out, the court felt, by the fact that three States by court decision had struck down their prohibitions on drug price advertising.  Florida Board of Pharmacy v. Webb's City, Inc., 219 So. 2d 681 (Fla. 1969); Maryland Board of Pharmacy v. Sav-A-Lot, Inc., 270 Md. 103 .  311 A. 2d 242 (1973); Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy v. Pastor, 441 Pa. 186 , 272 A. 2d 487 (1971).  [12] The District Court recognized that this Court had upheldagainst federal constitutional challenges other than on First Amendment groundsstate restrictions *756 on the advertisement of prices for optometrists' services, Head v. New Mexico Board, 374 U. S. 424 (1963), for eyeglass frames, Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., <citedDecision>348 U. S. 483</citedDecision> (1955), and for dentists' services, Semler v. Dental Examiners, 294 U. S. 608 (1935).  [13] The same dangers of abuse and deception were not thought to be present, however, when the advertised commodity was prescribed by a physician for his individual patient and was dispensed by a licensed pharmacist.  The Board failed to justify the statute adequately, and it had to fall.  373 F. Supp., at 686-687 .  III The question first arises whether, even assuming that First Amendment protection attaches to the flow of drug price information, it is a protection enjoyed by the appellees as recipients of the information, and not solely, if at all, by the advertisers themselves who seek to disseminate that information.  Freedom of speech presupposes a willing speaker.  But where a speaker exists, as is the case here, [14] the protection afforded is to the communication, to its source and to its recipients both.

 This image, that of a skilled and specialized craftsman, attracts talent to the profession and reinforces the better habits of those who are in it.  Price advertising, it is said, will reduce the pharmacist's status to that of a mere retailer.  [23] The strength of these proffered justifications is greatly undermined by the fact that high professional standards, to a substantial extent, are guaranteed by the close regulation to which pharmacists in Virginia are subject.  And this case concerns the retail sale by the pharmacist more than it does his professional standards.  Surely, any pharmacist guilty of professional dereliction that actually endangers his customer will promptly lose his *769 license.  At the same time, we cannot discount the Board's justifications entirely.  The Court regarded justifications of this type sufficient to sustain the advertising bans challenged on due process and equal protection grounds in Head v. New Mexico Board, supra ; <citedDecision>Williamson</citedDecision> v. Lee Optical Co., supra ; and Semler v. Dental Examiners, supra .  The challenge now made, however, is based on the First Amendment.  This casts the Board's justifications in a different light, for on close inspection it is seen that the State's protectiveness of its citizens rests in large measure on the advantages of their being kept in ignorance.  The advertising ban does not directly affect professional standards one way or the other.  It affects them only through the reactions it is assumed people will have to the free flow of drug price information.  There is no claim that the advertising ban in any way prevents the cutting of corners by the pharmacist who is so inclined.  That pharmacist is likely to cut corners in any event.

 E. g., Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502 (1934); Olsen v. Nebraska, 313 U. S. 236 (1941).  As Mr. Justice Black, writing for the Court, observed in Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 730 (1963): "The doctrine .  .  .  that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwiselyhas long since been discarded.  We have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies who are elected to pass laws." Similarly in Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., <citedDecision>348 U. S. 483</citedDecision> (1955), the Court, in dealing with a state prohibition against the advertisement of eyeglass frames, held: "We see no constitutional reason why a State may not treat all who deal with the human eye as members of a profession who should use no merchandising methods for obtaining customers." <citedDecision>Id., at 490</citedDecision> .  The Court addresses itself to the valid justifications which may be found for the Virginia statute, and apparently discounts them because it feels they embody a "highly paternalistic approach." Ante, at 770.  It concludes that the First Amendment requires that channels of advertising communication with respect to prescription drugs must be opened, and that Virginia may not *785 keep "the public in ignorance of the entirely lawful terms that competing pharmacists are offering." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> The Court concedes that legislatures may prohibit false and misleading advertisements, and may likewise prohibit advertisements seeking to induce transactions which are themselves illegal.  In a final footnote the opinion tosses a bone to the traditionalists in the legal and medical professions by suggesting that because they sell services rather than drugs the holding of this case is not automatically applicable to advertising in those professions.  But if the sole limitation on permissible state proscription of advertising is that it may not be false or misleading, surely the difference between pharmacists' advertising and lawyers' and doctors' advertising can be only one of degree and not of kind.  I cannot distinguish between the public's right to know the price of drugs and its right to know the price of title searches or physical examinations or other professional services for which standardized fees are charged.  Nor is it apparent how the pharmacists in this case are less engaged in a regulatable profession than were the opticians in <citedDecision>Williamson, supra</citedDecision> .  Nor will the impact of the Court's decision on existing commercial and industrial practice be limited to allowing advertising by the professions.  The Court comments that in labor disputes "it has long been settled that both the employee and the employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome." Ante, at 762.  But the first case cited by the Court in support of this proposition, NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575, 617-618 (1969), falls a good deal short of supporting this general statement.  The Court there said that "an employer is free to communicate to his employees any of his general views about unionism or any of his specific views about a particular union, so long as the *786 communications do not contain a `threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.'" Id., at 618 .
