 The second point is that in practice and from time to time in principle, the Court has given ample recognition to society’s interest in suspect questioning as an instrument of law enforcement.  Cases countenancing quite significant pressures can be cited without difficulty, 5 and the lower courts may often have been yet more tolerant.  Of course the limitations imposed today were rejected by necessary implication in case after case, the right to warnings having been explicitly rebuffed in this Court many years ago.  Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303 ; Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613 .  As recently as Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 515 , the Court openly acknowledged that questioning of witnesses and suspects “is undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement.” Accord, Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 441 .  Finally, the cases disclose that the language in many of the opinions overstates the actual course of decision.  It has been said, for example, that an admissible confession must be made by the suspect “in the unfettered exercise of his own will,” Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1, 8</citedDecision> , and that “a prisoner is not ‘to be made the deluded instrument of his own conviction,’ ” Culomhe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 581 (Frankfurter, J., announcing the Court’s judgment and an opinion).  Though often repeated, such principles are rarely observed in full measure.  Even the word “voluntary” may be deemed some *510 what misleading, especially when one considers many of the confessions that have been brought under its umbrella.  See, e. g., supra, n. 5.  The tendency to overstate may be laid in part to the flagrant facts often before the Court; but in any event one must recognize how it has tempered attitudes and lent some color of authority to the approach now taken by the Court. I turn now to the Court’s asserted reliance on the Fifth Amendment, an approach which I frankly regard as a trompb Voeil.  The Court’s opinion in my view reveals no adequate basis for extending the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against self-incrimination to the police station.  Far more important, it fails to show that the Court’s new rules are well supported, let alone compelled, by Fifth Amendment precedents.

 Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 321, n. 2 , collects 28 cases. Bator & Vorenberg, Arrest, Detention, Interrogation and the Right to Counsel, 66 Col. L. Rev. 62, 73 (1966): “In fact, the concept of involuntariness seems to be used by the courts as a shorthand to refer to practices which are repellent to civilized standards of decency or which, under the circumstances, are thought to apply a degree of pressure to an individual which unfairly impairs his capacity to make a rational choice.” See Herman, The Supreme Court and Restrictions on Police Interrogation, 25 Ohio St. L. J. 449, 452-458 (1964); Developments, supra, n. 2, at 964-984.  See the cases synopsized in Herman, supra, n. 4, at 456, nn. 36-39.  One not too distant example is Stroble v. California, 343 U. S. 181 , in which the suspect was kicked and threatened after his arrest, questioned a little later for two hours, and isolated from a lawyer trying to see him; the resulting confession was held admissible.  Among the examples given in 8 Wigmore, Evidence § 2266, at 401 (McNaughton rev. 1961), are these: the privilege applies to any witness, civil or criminal, but the confession rule protects only criminal defendants; the privilege deals only with compulsion, while the confession rule may exclude statements obtained by trick or promise; and where the privilege has been nullified — as by the English Bankruptcy Act — the confession rule may still operate.  Additionally, there are precedents and even historical arguments that can be arrayed in favor of bringing extra-legal questioning within the privilege.  See generally Maguire, Evidence of Guilt §2.03, at 15-16 (1959).  This, of course, is implicit in the Court’s introductory announcement that “[o]ur decision in Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1964) [extending the Fifth Amendment privilege to the States] necessitates *512 an examination of the scope of the privilege in state cases as well.” Ante, p. 463.  It is also inconsistent with <citedDecision>Malloy</citedDecision> itself, in which extension of the Fifth Amendment to the States rested in part on the view that the Due Process Clause restriction on state confessions has in recent years been “the same standard” as that imposed in federal prosecutions assertedly bv the Fifth Amendment.  378 U. S., at 7.  I lay aside Escobedo itself; it contains no reasoning or even general conclusions addressed to the Fifth Amendment and indeed its citation in this regard seems surprising in view of Escobedo’s primary reliance on the Sixth Amendment.  Since the Court conspicuously does not assert that the Sixth Amendment itself warrants its new police-interrogation rules, there is no reason now to draw out the extremely powerful historical and precedential evidence that the Amendment will bear no such meaning.  See generally Friendly, The Bill of Rights as a Code of Criminal Procedure, 53 Calif. L. Rev. 929 , 943-948 (1965).  See supra, n. 4, and text.  Of course, the use of terms like voluntariness involves questions of law and terminology quite as much as questions of fact.
