**Combined Opinion**
 After first acknowledging that, but for Bramblett , it might well have accepted the argument that Congress did not intend § 1001 to apply to the courts, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction.  But the court was clearly troubled by the potential sweep of § 1001.  Noting that the statute prohibits "concealment" and "covering up" of material facts, as well as intentional falsehoods, the court wondered whether the statute might be interpreted to criminalize conduct that falls well within the bounds of responsible advocacy.  [9] The court concluded its opinion with this significant comment: "We are certain that neither Congress nor the Supreme Court intended the statute to include traditional trial tactics within the statutory terms `conceals or covers up.' We hold only, on the authority of the Supreme Court construction, that the statute does apply to the type of action with which appellant was charged, action which essentially involved the `administrative' or `housekeeping' functions, not the `judicial' machinery of the court." 309 F. 2d, at 237 .  Relying on Morgan , the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a conviction several years later "because § 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents as evidence in a criminal proceeding." United States v. Erhardt, <citedDecision>381 F. 2d 173, 175</citedDecision> (1967) (per curiam) .  The court explained that the judicial function exception suggested in Morgan was necessary to prevent the perjury statute, with its two-witness rule (since repealed), from being undermined.  <citedDecision>381 F. 2d, at 175</citedDecision> .  *710 Once planted, the judicial function exception began to flower in a number of other Circuits.  The Ninth Circuit summarized the state of the law in 1985: "[T]he adjudicative functions exception to section 1001 has been suggested or recognized by appellate decisions since 1962, not long after the Supreme Court decided that section 1001 applies to matters within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch.  In these twenty-three years, there has been no response on the part of Congress either repudiating the limitation or refining it.  It therefore seems too late in the day to hold that no exception exists." United States v. Mayer, 775 F. 2d 1387, 1390 (per curiam) (footnote omitted).  The Second Circuit sounded a similar theme in 1991, relying in part on the congressional acquiescence to which the Ninth Circuit had adverted in Mayer .
**Combined Opinion**
 The overlaps here simply demonstrate that prosecutors cannot be said to have any significant reliance interest in Bramblett .  [15]  The absence of significant reliance interests is confirmed by an examinationof statisticaldata regarding actualcases brought under§ 1001.  The Government has secured convictions under § 1001 in 2,247 cases over the last five fiscal years, see post, at 722, but the dissent can identify only five reported § 1001 cases in that time period brought in connection with falsestatements made tothe Judiciaryand Legislature.  Post, at 723, n. (At leasttwo ofthe five were unsuccessful, fromthe Government's pointof view.) This tinyhandfulof prosecutionsdoes not,inour view, evidence a weighty reliance interest on the part of prosecutors in adhering to the interpretation of § 1001 set forth in Bramblett .
