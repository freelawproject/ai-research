 It is difficult to perceive how North Carolina could be said to have an interest in Nevada’s domiciliaries superior to the interest of Nevada.  Nor is there any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state.  Certainly Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145 , did not so hold.  Indeed, the recent case of Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, 306 U. S. 493, 502 , held that in the case of statutes “the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of another state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the courts of the state of its enactment with respect to the same persons and events.” Moreover, Haddock v. Haddock is not based on the contrary theory.  Nor did it hold that a decree of divorce granted by the courts of one state need not be given full faith and credit in another if the grounds for the divorce would not be recognized by the courts of the forum.  It does not purport to challenge or disturb the rule, earlier established by Christmas v. Russell, supra, and subsequently fortified by Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra, that, even though the cause of action could not have been entertained in the state of the forum, a judgment obtained thereon in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit.  For the majority opinion in the Haddock case accepted both Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108 , and Atherton v. Atherton, <citedDecision>181 U. S. 155</citedDecision> .  Cheever v. Wilson held that a decree of divorce granted by a state in which one spouse was domiciled and which had personal jurisdiction over the other was as conclusive in other states as it was in the state where it was obtained.  <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> held that full faith and credit must be given a decree of divorce granted by *297 the state of the matrimonial domicil on constructive service against the other spouse who was a non-resident of that state.  The decisive difference between those cases and Haddock v. Haddock was said to be that, in the latter, the state granting the divorce had no jurisdiction over the absent spouse, since it was not the state of the matrimonial domicil, but the place where the husband had acquired a separate domicil after having wrongfully left his wife.  This Court accordingly classified Haddock v. Haddock with that group of cases which hold that when the courts of one state do not have jurisdiction either of the subject matter or of the person of the defendant, the courts of another state are not required by virtue of the full faith and credit clause to enforce the judgment.  7 But such differences in result between Haddock v. Haddock and the cases which preceded it rest on distinctions which in our view are immaterial, so far as the full faith and credit clause and the supporting legislation are concerned.  The historical view that a proceeding for a divorce was a proceeding in rem (2 Bishop, Marriage & Divorce, 4th ed., § 164) was rejected by the Haddock case. We likewise agree that it does not aid in the solution of the problem presented by this case to label these proceedings as proceedings in rem. Such a suit, however, is not a mere in personam action.  Domicil of the plaintiff, immaterial to jurisdiction in a personal action, is recognized in the Haddock case and elsewhere (Beale, Conflict of Laws, § 110.1) as essential in order to give the court jurisdiction which will entitle the divorce decree to extraterritorial effect, at least when the defendant has neither been personally served nor entered an appearance.  The findings *298 made in the divorce decrees in the instant case must be treated on the issue before us as meeting those requirements.

 See Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, 286 U. S. 276, 279 ; New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, 300 U. S. 308, 313 ; Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463-464 ; Skiriotes v. Florida, 313 U. S. 69 .  Each state as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate concern in the marital status of persons domiciled within its borders.  The marriage relation creates problems of large social importance.  ' Protection of offspring, property interests, and the enforcement of marital responsibilities are but a few of commanding problems in the field of domestic relations with which the state must deal.  Thus it is plain that each state, by virtue of its command over its domiciliaries and its large interest in the institution of marriage, can alter within its *299 own borders the marriage status of the spouse domiciled there, even though the other spouse is absent.  There is no constitutional barrier if the form and nature of the substituted service (see Milliken v. Meyer, supra, p. 463 ) meet the requirements of due process.  <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Atherton, supra, p. 172</citedDecision> .  Accordingly, it was admitted in the Haddock case that the divorce decree, though not recognized in New York, was binding on both spouses in Connecticut where granted.  201 U. S. 569 , 572, 575, 579.  And this Court in Maynard, v. Hill, 125 U. S. 190 , upheld the validity within the Territory of Oregon of a divorce decree granted by the legislature to a husband domiciled there, even though the wife resided in Ohio where the husband had deserted her.  It therefore follows that, if the Nevada decrees are taken at their full face value (as they must be on the phase of the case with which we are presently concerned), they were wholly effective to change in that state the marital status of the petitioners and each of the other spouses by the North Carolina marriages.  Apart from the requirements of procedural due process (Atherton v. <citedDecision>Atherton, supra, p. 172</citedDecision> ) not challenged here by North Carolina, no reason based on the Federal Constitution has been advanced for the contrary conclusion.  But the concession that the decrees were effective in Nevada makes more compelling the reasons for rejection of the theory and result of the Haddock case. This Court stated in <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Atherton, supra, p. 162</citedDecision> , that “A husband without a wife, or a wife without a husband, is unknown to the law.” But if one is lawfully divorced and remarried in Nevada and still married to the first spouse in North Carolina, an even more complicated and serious condition would be realized.  We would then have what the Supreme Court of Illinois declared to be the “most perplexing and distressing complications in the domestic relations of many citizens in the different States.” Dunham v. Dunham, 162 Ill. 589, 607 .  Under the cir *300 cumstances of this case, a man would have two wives, a wife two husbands.  The reality of a sentence to prison proves that that is no mere play on words.  Each would be a bigamist for living in one state with the only one with whom the other state would permit him lawfully to live.  Children of the second marriage would be bastards in one state but legitimate in the other.  And all that would flow from the legalistic notion that where one spouse is wrongfully deserted he retains power over the matrimonial domicil so that the domicil of the other spouse follows him wherever he may go, while, if he is to blame, he retains no such power.

 As stated by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent in the Haddock case (201 U. S. p. 630), they constitute a “pure fiction, and fiction always is a poor ground for changing substantial rights.” Furthermore, the fault or wrong of one spouse in leaving the other becomes under that view a jurisdictional fact on which this Court would ultimately have to pass.  Whatever may be said as to the practical effect which such a rule would have in clouding divorce decrees, the question as to where the fault lies has no relevancy to the existence of state power in such circumstances.  See Bingham, In the Matter of Haddock v. Haddock , 21 Corn.  L. Q. 393, 426.  The existence of the power of a state to alter the marital status of its domiciliaries, as distinguished from the wisdom of its exercise, is not dependent on the underlying causes of the domestic rift.  As we have said, it is dependent on the relationship which domicil creates and the pervasive control which a state has over marriage and divorce within its own borders.  <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> , which preceded Haddock v. Haddock , and Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551 , which followed it, recognized that the power of the state of the matrimonial domicil to grant a divorce from the absent spouse did not depend on whether his departure from the state was or was not *301 justified.  As stated above, we see no reason, and none has here been advanced, for making the existence of state power depend on an inquiry as to where the fault in each domestic dispute lies.  And it is difficult to prick out any such line of distinction in the generality of the words of the full faith and credit clause.  Moreover, so far as state power is concerned, no distinction between a matrimonial domicil and a domicil later acquired has been suggested or is apparent.  See Mr. Justice Holmes dissenting, Haddock v. Haddock, supra, p. 631 ; Goodrich, Matrimonial Domicile, 27 Yale L. Journ. 49.  It is one thing to say as a matter of state law that jurisdiction to grant a divorce from an absent spouse should depend on whether by consent or by conduct the latter has subjected his interest in the marriage status to the law of the separate domicil acquired by the other spouse.
