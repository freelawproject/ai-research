 Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, § 1101 (a) (Supp. 1976).  In 1972, 18 also was established as the age of majority for males and females in civil matters, Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, § 13 (1972 and Supp. 1976), except that §§241 and 245 of the 3.2% beer statute were simultaneously codified to create an exception to the gender-free rule.  Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that Reed emphasized that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are “subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.” 404 U. S., at 75 .  To withstand constitutional challenge, previous cases establish that classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.  Thus, in Reed , the ob *198 jectives of “reducing the workload on probate courts,” id., at 76 , and “avoiding intrafamily controversy,” id., at 77 , were deemed of insufficient importance to sustain use of an overt gender criterion in the appointment of administrators of intestate decedents’ estates.  Decisions following Reed similarly have rejected administrative ease and convenience as sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-based classifications.  See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, <citedDecision>405 U. S. 645, 656</citedDecision> (1972); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 690 (1973); cf. Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498, 506-507 (1975).  And only two Terms ago, Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7 (1975), expressly stating that Reed v. Reed was “controlling,” 421 U. S., at 13 , held that Reed required invalidation of a Utah differential age-of-majority statute, notwithstanding the statute’s coincidence with and furtherance of the State’s purpose of fostering “old notions” of role typing and preparing boys for their expected performance in the economic and political worlds.  421 U. S., at 14-15 .  6 Reed v. Reed has also provided the underpinning for decisions that have invalidated statutes employing gender as an inaccurate proxy for other, more germane bases of classification.  Hence, “archaic.  and overbroad” generalizations, Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra, at 508 , concerning the financial position of servicewomen, Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 689 n. 23, and working women, Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 643 (1975), could not justify use of a gender line in determining eligibility for certain governmental entitlements.  Similarly, increasingly outdated *199 misconceptions concerning the role of females in the home rather than in the “marketplace and world of ideas” were rejected as loose-fitting characterizations incapable of supporting state statutory schemes that were premised upon their accuracy.  Stanton v. Stanton, supra; Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 , 535 n. 17 (1975).  In light of the weak congruence between gender and the characteristic or trait that gender purported to represent, it was necessary that the legislatures choose either to realign their substantive laws in a gender-neutral fashion, or to adopt procedures for identifying those instances where the sex-centered generalization actually comported with fact.  See, e. g., Stanley v. <citedDecision>Illinois, supra, at 658</citedDecision> ; cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U. S. 632, 650 (1974).  In this case, too, “Reed, we feel, is controlling ...,” Stanton v. Stanton, supra, at 13 .  We turn then to the question whether, under Reed , the difference between males and females with respect to the purchase of 3.2% beer warrants the differential in age drawn by the Oklahoma statute.  We conclude that it does not.  B The District Court recognized that Reed v. Reed was controlling.  In applying the teachings of that case, the court found the requisite important governmental objective in the traffic-safety goal proffered by the Oklahoma Attorney General, It then concluded that the statistics introduced by the appellees established that the gender-based distinction was substantially related to achievement of that goal.  C We accept for purposes of discussion the District Court’s identification of the objective underlying §§ 241 and 245 as the enhancement of traffic safety.
